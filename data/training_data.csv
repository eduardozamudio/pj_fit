Our special guest this morning as we have our first hearing or the hearing for the reappointment of Ms. Ness to the Federal Communications Commission.;N
I don't have much of a statement to make prior to the--I will reflect that in my questions, and I would move my spotlight to my ranking member on this Committee, Senator Hollings.;N
I include my statement in the record and yield to our distinguished Senators who are prepared to introduce the witness.;N
We appreciate your coming this morning and your interest in this appointment, and I would ask at this time is Mr. Sarbanes ready to introduce his special guest?;N
I'm very pleased to be here to indicate my very strong support for the reconfirmation of Susan Ness as the Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.;N
During her tenure there, she's chaired the Commission's Federal/State Joint Board charged with addressing universal telephone service issues.;D
She's been the Commission's lead representative for the 1995-1997 World Radio Communications Conference.;D
She's currently a member of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners Committee on Communications and the Federal Communications Bar Association.;D
The Committee knows well that she's been an active proponent of fair competition both domestically and globally.;D
She's worked hard to promote the advancement of new technologies, expand economic opportunities, reduce regulatory uncertainty.;D
She's played a key role in shaping policies for the efficient management of the radio spectrum.;D
She's credited with helping to forge a consensus on the digital television standard, on guidelines to improve the quality and quantity of children's educational television program.;D
She's worked tirelessly to facilitate delivery of advanced telecommunications systems to the classroom and to community libraries so that all children can participate in the telecommunications and information revolution.;D
She had a very distinguished record before coming to the Commission, although obviously her performance there is a critical standard in judging her reconfirmation.;D
She has been a senior lender to communication companies as the vice-president of a regional financial institution.;D
She has been a very active leader in our community in Maryland, a Chair of the Montgomery County Charter Review Commission, Vice Chair of the County's Task Force on Community Access to Television.;D
She has done I think a terrific job in handling some very tough problems before the Commission.;D
I think she's reflected prudence, intelligence, fair and balanced judgment and I strongly urge the Committee to permit her to carry forward her good work by reconfirming her for another term on the FCC.;D
I believe my senior colleague covered a lot of the information that I wish to convey as well and ask unanimous consent that my statement go into the record.;N
Mr. Chairman, I, too, wholeheartedly endorse the renomination of Susan Ness to be a Commissioner at the FCC.;N
I think she brings competence, I think she brings experience and I think she brings a sense of community because sometimes we get so fascinated by technology--what are the new regulatory--we forget that really ultimately, telecommunications is to serve the consumer and to help bring the world together, either business to business or business to consumers or people to people.;D
She brought to the Commission initially an incredible educational background, a graduate from Douglass College, in addition to that, a law degree from Boston College and then went on and got a Master's Degree in Business Administration from Wharton.;D
Now, that's a pretty excellent background to bring to the technical issues facing FCC and the need to understand both the law as well as the business aspects.;D
We have been particularly proud of the job she's done in the FCC and the challenges that she's taken a very keen interest in improving children's educational TV, promoting universal service and universal access, again, a very keen interest to be sure that you don't have a digital divide in the United States of America between our children who have access to technology and those who don't, the roll-out of digital television, new wireless service, expanding competition in telephone and video, efficient spectrum management.;D
Then she's also taken the work of unnecessary regulations, not what else can we do but what don't we have to do so we don't have to shackle this new world of E business and E buzz.;D
In her work at the Federal/State Joint Board, she has represented us in World Radio Communications conferences in Switzerland.;D
She was the FCC's rep in 1995 and 1997 and one of the areas that she's expressed interest in, I know the Committee was very strong in this, this opening overseas market.;D
If we invent it, we want to be able to sell it and I think she's been a real champion of that.;D
She's been recognized by her peers, a recipient of the International Radio and TV Society Foundation.;D
Electronic Media named her as one of 12 to watch in 1997 and she was honored by the Women of Wireless and the American Women in Radio and TV for all of her efforts.;D
I know that her family's here and they have been very proud of her work as the two Senators have, and I believe that she will ably do it, continue to do a very able job on the Commission.;D
And I think anybody who brings her owns mitts is always prepared for anything that lies ahead so I wholeheartedly endorse her renomination.;D
Before we take your statement, Commissioner, we have been joined by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.;N
I know it and that is the reason I called you last night with great respect to ask your permission if I could talk for about 60 seconds, and you said yes.;N
I want to do that because I so strongly support Susan Ness and I think it is incredibly important for the FCC that she be renominated.;N
She's taken from the telecommunication to regulation act every single aspect of that and worked it through.;D
We've spent endless hours working together overcoming problems and she's patient, understanding, knows it.;D
I didn't even know about The Wharton School until I was reading about it last night, but that's just another dimension.;N
She's been very strong on universal service, she's been very strong on consumer interest, and very strong on trying to get compromise for a digital television standard effective on that.;D
She's pushed to move new technologies toward the marketplace as quickly as possible, which I think is important for a Commissioner, and she's been a very effective advocate for spectrum management policies that create a level playing field for all kinds of technologies.;D
But given all that, still I think the experience is the thing which is so important, the stability which is needed on the FCC.;D
I sorely suspect that they're understaffed, that they're under-funded, and I will have questions for her on that, but I'm extremely supportive of her renomination.;N
I think it's an absolute must for the success of the FCC in a situation where all the work that she does is moving much more quickly than we in Congress, where our committees were set up just after the second World War are prepared to deal with them, so we really need Susan Ness.;D
Now we'll have a statement from Ms. Ness and welcome this morning and before this Committee.;N
Mr. Chairman, let me just say hearing all these laudatory statements, that I think of the comment made by Winston Churchill in July 1945.;N
We had VE Day on May the 8th of 1945 and the end of July, Mr. Churchill was voted out of office by Clement Atlee, and under the rule in the United Kingdom, you're supposed to be outside, which he was, of 10 Downing with his clothing rack and his chest of drawers.;N
Here was a fellow who had won the war to end all wars and in just 3 months' time they were getting rid of him.;N
And Ms. Ness has been held up now since, what, almost a year, having done an outstanding job.;D
As Churchill says, don't look for gratitude, which she's got some good friends here, and you waited entirely too long.;D
The only reason I asked, Mr. Chairman, for you to yield just a second is because I wanted to commend the Commission on its rulings with respect to Section 271 now that we have had Bell Atlantic.;N
You've instituted an Enforcement Bureau, and let's continue with that, because that's highly important that we don't think to just get approval and then they don't have to still comply with their 14-point checklist.;N
The lawyers for the Bell companies wrote those 14 points, and I'm very, very much along with Senator Rockefeller in support of your renomination, and I hope we can get it in the next markup here so we can get it to the floor.;N
Well, I think maybe with citing Churchill and his demise after World War II, it stood by the old Presbyterian saying that no good deed shall go unpunished, and we may be in that sort of a situation, but I understand that it is the Chairman of--the full Committee's intent is to move this nomination out of Committee, and that's what I understand now, anyway, and I think that's a good sign.;N
We've been joined by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, west of the river, we might add, Senator Dorgan.;N
I think Senator Rockefeller indicated that this is a Commission that very much needs her continued leadership.;D
I voted for all of them and I'm proud they're there, but Commissioner Ness has been there and is the, as Senator Rockefeller indicated, the institutional memory.;N
But, more important from my standpoint and I think the standpoint of perhaps you and others, Mr. Chairman, is as we implement the Telecommunications Act, the use of the Universal Service Fund to build out the infrastructure for advanced telecommunications services will have a lot to do with how this country looks in the future.;N
It will have a lot to do with where people live, where jobs are created, where people move, where people do business.;N
If we have a country in which there is a digital divide and small towns and rural areas do not have the larger pipes or the advanced services through which data can move, they are destined not to attract economic development and jobs and new opportunities.;N
We must avoid that at all cost, and we must take steps and actions to make sure that the Universal Service Fund is used as the Act was written and intended.;N
The Universal Service Fund in the Telecommunications Act is designed not only to facilitate the services of telephones at affordable prices, and comparable service but in addition to that, we wrote into the Act that it relates to advanced telecommunications services or broadband, as well, so the connection of the Universal Service Fund to that requirement and that opportunity is critically important.;N
There's no one on the Commission who has a better understanding of that or understands the urgency of that better than Commissioner Ness.;D
As someone representing a rural state, it is imperative that we keep Commissioner Ness on that Commission fighting for those issues.;D
This is not a case of her fighting our fight on these issues at the expense of someone else.;N
It is the fact that the implementation of the Telecommunications Act is working quite well in some areas of the country.;N
There is robust, aggressive competition where there is an income stream to justify it, and we all understand that.;N
I just had a meeting a moment ago when a colleague of mine, Senator Burns, took out his Palm VII and someone said, ``Is that wireless?'';N
And the point he was making just by answering the inquiry was yeah, this is wireless and it's wonderful, I'm glad I have it this morning in Washington, DC but in Montana, it doesn't work.;N
Wouldn't work in North Dakota, either, because we don't have ubiquitous services all across this country and the build-;N
I think everyone at this dais at this point has an interest in seeing that rural areas experience the full flower of opportunity coming from the Telecommunications Act.;N
Well, like I said, the Chairman has already indicated that he is going to move this nomination out of Committee so we're happy about that.;N
Let me start off by--I don't know of anybody that I've had the opportunity to work with since I come to Washington, DC, and since you were put on the Commission that we have had a very, very good working relationship and I want--and I appreciate your accessibility.;N
Also, we've done some things in the country and you've been very, very, very active in furthering those things, and those things we are concerned about in rural areas and how universal service works and how we are seeing the roll-;D
There's a couple of areas that I have concerns about, if you would just help me along a little bit, that has to do with Section 706, of course, in the Telecom Act.;N
I had quite a lot to do with that Section and the build-out of technology into rural areas and this type thing and broadband deployment in this thing.;N
Could you give the Committee your view of the current state of that broadband roll-out in America and specifically in rural areas?;N
Do you think the Commission has been aggressive, as aggressive as it should have been in implementing 706?;N
Give me an idea of when you start looking at a section like that in the deployment of broadband, have we had a disagreement on the Commission on how it should be implemented or what the Commission should be doing.;N
Now, let's face it, now, in my state of Montana and like the state of West Virginia and the state of North Dakota, we are not exactly--;N
Billings, Montana may be rural by the measurement that we use nationwide, and then when we go to Lewistown, Montana, that's frontier, and going back to some old terms used in Medicare and things.;N
Senator Dorgan is exactly right on the build-out, and if we're going to have any kind of economic chance to stay up with the rest of the world in a national or a global economy, broadband is essential out there.;N
We've got a situation now in rural America that is not a very pretty picture, and until America wants to pay more for its bread, we're going to continue to be in a very, very--in an economic state that we're very uncomfortable in in our area, so we know it's very important.;N
Thank you, Commissioner Ness, for coming in front of the group and answering some questions.;N
I want to turn if I could to some specific questions regarding particularly Bell Atlantic's application to get into in-region long distance service in New York, but not so much that but the template it sets for future roll-outs there.;N
In the separate statement that you issued in conjunction with the Commission's approval of Bell Atlantic's application to provide in-region long distance service in New York, you indicated that it would have been in your words unfair to penalize Bell Atlantic for its record on DSL loop performance at this time, close quote.;N
You state that, quote, because the consumer market for broadband services has only recently begun to develop, end quote, the FCC collaborative process did not adequately address the ordering and provisioning of DSL-capable loops.;N
Then you go on to say that our evaluation of future applications will be focused on this issue.;N
Now, in reading all of those together it sounds a lot like that you may be favoring an ever-expanding checklist before other applicants are going to be allowed these same opportunities that were provided to Bell Atlantic, and I'm concerned if that is the case, if there's going to be more items on the checklist, that people don't know about, and I would like for you to tell us today, is the checklist set now for applicants seeking to provide that long distance service?;N
So the checklist for future applications will remain the same as it was for Bell Atlantic's application when it went through the FCC?;N
I want to make sure that companies in making their applications know here's the hurdles we have to clear and that they're set and there are not additional ones that are put after the first one has been cleared.;N
We're now in 2000 and it seems like it's taken quite a while to implement this Act, and I would hope that those checklists could be set, firmed up and everybody know what they have to meet to get into long distance services.;N
In your statement accompanying the Commission's May 7, 1997 Universal Service Order you indicated you thought the FCC had made substantial progress and established a clear timetable for implementation of that Telecommunications Act which was enacted into law February 8th of 1996, which in telecommunications development is ancient history, I suppose, given this rate of change.;N
Did you really think that 4 years after the bill became law that the FCC would still not have fully implemented the high-;N
cost provisions of Section 254? Do you consider how long it has taken and how much further we have to go for a clear timetable there?;N
If I might submit to you, 4 years is a long time, given the rate of change that's taken place in telecommunications and the platform for the new economy that it's providing, and by not having this issue resolved, it further impedes investment into rural and other high-cost areas.;N
I would really hope we could step, you know, step up the implementation of that so the rural areas and those providing telephony and other services would know what they've got to work with.;N
Last year I introduced legislation that prohibits the application of spectrum caps to new spectrum that is auctioned in the future.;N
One of the reasons I introduced the bill was to accelerate the introduction of advance services, including wireless Internet access and other data services, for which operators need substantially more spectrum in order to provide the service.;N
Given the fact that some of the spectrums from C and F block licenses is not currently being used, is it safe to conclude that relief from the spectrum cap could be granted for these licenses without risking industry consolidation?;N
If so, shouldn't relief be granted to ensure that advance wireless services develop without behind relevancies?;N
Well, I'd hoped that we could provide those and make them available so that more of the advance services would be available.;N
It's very interesting, in fact, that our Committee system was in fact set up many, many years ago having absolutely no idea of the science and technology kinds of changes.;N
Then you have the phenomenon of a Senate where, oh, I guess there's maybe a couple in their 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's are the ages, and so therefore, our making a policy or deciding not to make policy for the purposes of the advancement of science and technology in telecommunications is very important.;N
But it also, I think, means that the Federal Communications Commission is even more important, because we really don't have the experience by virtue of generation, although many of us are trying, that the Commission does, and particularly you, because as I indicated, you are the only member of the Commission who has served since, you know, the Telecommunications Act was passed.;N
Senator Brownback indicated that that was really a very long time ago, but it seems like yesterday, and what I would like to do, if you would sort of reflect on some of the issues that--you've learned from this very kind of difficult transition from what appeared to be a relatively clear act to the four years.;N
That includes, as I indicated, under-funding, getting sued for every single thing that you do or whatever.;N
Senator Snowe and I later this week are going to be introducing a rural telecommunications bill that addresses what Senator Dorgan is also very concerned about, and that is the build-out of broadband in rural areas or, rather, the lack of build-out.;N
And it's very interesting to look at what Bell Atlantic and others plan in terms of broadband in West Virginia, and it basically covers five of our 55 counties and ignores all the others.;N
And that gets you into another definition of the digital divide, not just the use of computers but the use of data flow, individual, you know, flow, and all the rest of it and at what speed--you know, what's the upload, what's the download time, et cetera.;N
And so Senator Snowe and I are going to be introducing this bill which provides a tax credit to them.;N
And I'm not necessarily a tax credit type of Senator, but I think that, you know, if that will help telecommunications expand and build out into rural areas, and we define rural areas in a particular way--and this doesn't go on forever.;N
Most people on this Committee come from rural states and very much like the Finance Committee, which used to be an Oil and Gas Committee, is now pretty much a rural Committee, and I would just be interested in your concept in terms of what it might be like in 10 years or what needs to happen over those 10 years.;N
You know, Senator Dorgan said that comparable services include not just universal service but also broadband, and that's in the law, and yet here I am offering a tax credit bill to try and entice companies to do something which under the law they ought to be doing, and that worries me.;N
And even the tax credit bill which Senator Snowe and I are going to introduce, I think the telecommunications companies like that but, on the other hand, even that will not cover all of West Virginia.;N
It's just going to be an increment of improvement and I think that, you know, I just think that's terribly important.;N
I was in two of them, and in one of them, there was an Internet company because there had been a special build-out for them but for nobody else within a hundred miles in any direction.;N
Commissioner, I believe neither Senator Snowe nor I have voted and there's a vote probably about to finish so we will have to leave in a moment, and I'm unable to come back because I'm Ranking Member on an appropriations subcommittee that is meeting as well, so I have to be there.;N
First of all, there's no living American who can interpret his or her phone bill these days.;N
You know, you get a phone bill for 25 dollars and it's eight and a half pages and completely not understandable.;N
And I actually just made some calls to the carrier some while ago just for fun to see if they could explain it to me and they couldn't, so the people who sent me the bill don't know why they send me the bill, and it's eight to ten pages for $30.;N
Second on the issue of truth in billing, I have felt that you should connect access charge reform to universal service.;N
What's happened is you're giving companies access charge reductions to the tune of billions of dollars and they take those reductions and they smile and they say that's fine, we like that, but now what we're going to do is to tell the consumer in one line on our billing the universal service requirement.;N
So they put a few dollars on that phone bill that says, ``Here's what we've got to do because the government says we have to do it.'';N
Truth in billing would require that they tell the customer the whole story, and that is something we ought to be concerned about.;N
I think you ought to tie access charge reform specifically to universal service--connect those two numbers.;N
We want those companies that want to meet the checklist, go through it, and become competitive and do long distance.;N
We want them to do that and so we want the checklist not to be an insurmountable barrier, but the reason that this hasn't happened as quickly as some would suggest.;N
The Senator from Kansas wondered why some companies have not made it a decision, and they want to make the checklist.;N
It requires a company that says my company's goal is to meet this checklist, then take steps to do it.;N
Some companies have been pretty slow off the blocks in that regard, but for those that want to (and now many of them do), we don't want meeting the checklist to be an insurmountable barrier--we want it to be reasonable.;N
I'm going to ask--Bob Rowe from the National Association of Rural Utility Commissioners is working on a regional test to OSS testing under the 271 process.;N
And I probably won't be able to listen to them, and so if you will perhaps send me a note on that, I would appreciate it.;N
We haven't voted and I have been taking some time that Senator Snowe perhaps wants to take as well, so Commissioner Ness, consider those issues.;N
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to be here earlier but there are so many conflicting meetings this morning.;N
I want to take this opportunity to welcome Commissioner Ness to this Committee and for her nomination for a second term on the FCC.;N
I applaud her for the work that she has done, particularly in the area in upholding the universal service subsidy and providing the discounts to schools and libraries and health care facilities in all parts of the country.;D
And beyond her commitment in providing leadership at the FCC and chairing the Joint State-Federal Board on Universal Service.;D
Commissioner Ness also is very knowledgeable and experienced in so many of the telecommunications matters that are going to have an impact on the future of this country and is also committed to enforcing the laws as Congress intended.;D
Commissioner Ness, we appreciate your commitment to enforcing the laws according to the spirit of the statutes as passed by Congress over the years concerning telecommunications.;D
As Senator Rockefeller indicated, I do share his concern about the extent to which competition has reached the rural areas.;D
Certainly, the intent of the Telecommunications Act in the deregulation of the telecommunications industry was to bring competition to the rural areas of the country, as well.;N
That has been much slower, and I hope that the FCC and you will give it specific attention, particularly in terms of bringing broadband to rural areas, and that's why Senator Rockefeller and I are looking at providing a tax credit as a way of expediting broadband delivery to rural areas.;N
In addition, I hope that you can address this Committee in terms of what the FCC is doing to bring about competition in all areas because it is going to continue to make a difference in the have and have-;N
breaking, unprecedented merger between AOL and Time-Warner that may or may not have advantages or disadvantages at this time.;N
I think it is difficult to say, but I would also appreciate your views and perspective on these mergers and what kind of benefits or disadvantages do they bring to the consumers and what can we expect in the future.;N
So again, Commissioner Ness, thank you for the work that you have done and I hope that we can expedite your reconfirmation here because I think you have done a superb job on the Commission.;D
Going on in this, in some mergers I think you're entirely correct, some mergers are beneficial to the consumer and also the way we do business, some are not, and you have to look I guess at mergers on a case-by-case basis.;N
And we knew at some date content would take over and be the driving force of the Internet, and I think we have entered the era of that.;N
There are some areas of that that concern you, there are some areas that I think will be very beneficial.;N
Sometimes when mergers happen, everybody that is under that same tent it seems like it's very competitive with each other, and if that competition continues, why, I think that's a very good sign.;N
It just seems like the Commission without the direction of Congress just took off and started making policy with regard to low-power radio, and some of our most vocal critics has been those folks in public radio, the translater interference, this kind of interference, and I would just like your view on low power.;N
Why do you think the Commission has to take an active role that goes beyond the intent, what I believe is not the intent of Congress?;N
Why would we--even though the engineers at the FCC maybe do not have the same concerns as engineers across the country, I mean, I've not been into one major market and talked to engineering people that do not have concerns.;N
You see, I have the opinion that even though low power and some folks who want to put a low-power station should go through the same rigors of establishing a radio station that any other commercial broadcaster or public broadcaster makes when they establish an entity to do that and apply for spectrum in order to do it.;N
We have between newspapers and cable and broadcast industries and those entities, I would like your views on that, please.;N
Do you have a guiding principle whenever you start making these decisions on cross-ownership?;N
Is there any way that you have a philosophy on should the newspaper be able to own--and we have three television stations.;N
Any guiding light on should a newspaper in Billings, Montana be able to own a broadcast property there under those conditions?;N
That's like the old Harry Truman statement: Spend the first 6 months when you're here trying to figure out how you got here, then the next 6 months trying to figure out how everybody else got here.;N
It means millions of dollars in funding for school children and libraries to access the Internet.;N
It means insuring spectrum access for utility workers after a tornado enabling the troops of the 82d Airborne at Fort Benning to have more than adequate communication capability with their commanding officers when performing defense maneuvers.;N
More and more of them are making their homes in my state and access to broadband services--a number of services in addition to just telephone.;N
I look forward to hearing some of your ideas about your philosophy of the last 5 years of service and what you would like to do the next five.;N
Ms. Ness, as you know, Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act encourages the deployment of ``advanced telecommunications capability.'';N
The report the FCC issued in response stated that this technology is being deployed on a timely basis.;N
I would like to know what is your opinion on the employment of advanced services and what type of role do you see the E rate Program playing in achieving the goals of Section 706?;N
The 1996 act also requires co-location and interconnection with existing ILECs, incumbent local exchange carriers in their facilities.;N
"In your statement following the approval of Bell Atlantic's Section 271 application you indicated that previous FCC decisions, ``adequately addressed the ordering and provisioning of extant DSL loops;'' however, you said our evaluation of future applications will, indeed, focus on this issue.";N
I've been informed of the excellent work the FCC's wireless bureau has done in reducing its backlog of paperwork.;N
A great deal of the work the wireless bureau does directly impacts the spectrum allocation in the United States, which I hear is increasingly a challenge.;N
As you know, there's a great deal of exciting wireless technology that claims to reduce the amount of spectrum needed for this technology to operate while increasing the power and capability of wireless products.;N
Five years ago when you were approved by the Senate to sit on the FCC, so much of the technology and so many of the companies that are out there today in many ways didn't even exist or, shall we say, were not even on the radar screen 5 years ago.;N
Just seeing that incredible advance of technology, and the incredible investment in information and telecommunications technologies and companies that raise hair on our heads whenever we contemplate the billions and hundreds of billions invested in these companies, isn't it quite a challenge as we walk into the 21st century together that over the next 5 years, just what might happen?;N
You might see a need for the FCC to update or revamp or come up to speed on, and adjust or reform some of its practices and its own workings in order to keep up with the world that is growing exponentially at an incredible rate of speed.;N
When I look at just the last 5 years and look at the prospect of what might happen in the information technology and telecommunications in the next 5 years, it's stunning what might happen in the next ten.;N
So I just offer my word of support not only for your nomination and your further service on the FCC, but count on me to help you adapt to the need for speed in this incredible world where government hopefully can adapt quickly enough and surely enough to be responsive to industry but also continue to protect the public interest.;N
No, Mr. Chairman, but I would like to note that which I did not before, that Commissioner Tristani is here and I just think that's very nice.;N
I want to do some followup with you, Commissioner, with regard to I want to ask you--and I think this is better done in probably a private conversation, not keeping it from anyone, but I have some concerns about how we deal with spectrum and how we go through the auction business and how we handle it if it's repossessed and how we should use that and the FCC's role.;N
I think we're going to consider in Congress how we deal with spectrum once it is owned and how much control do we have to relinquish as a government, or do we lose complete control of that spectrum?;N
I would like to kind of ferret that out a little bit with you, and I think we can do that in private conversation, but there are some things happening that does concern Congress or at least this Member of Congress, anyway, with regard to dealing with spectrum and allocations and its use.;N
I would ask you that you might respond to the individual Senators and to the Committee for its review, and that's all the questions I have today, other than the fact that I'll be in touch with you as far as the spectrum is concerned.;N
But I want to thank you for coming today and responding to the questions, and appreciate your cooperation and I look forward in moving this nomination.;N
Well, Mr. Won, we intend to move your nomination on this markup so that you can be reappointed.;N
Do you have any questions for Mr. Won, who is nominee for reappointment to a second term at the Federal Maritime Commission?;N
As we were talking before you came in the room, I realized that I have known Norman Mineta now for 30 years.;N
In 1970, I was President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, he was a member of the San Jose City Council.;D
He then went on to become Vice Mayor and then in 1971 to 1974 Mayor of the City of San Jose.;D
In 1942 when he was 11, his family was among the 120,000 Japanese Americans forcibly removed to internment camps on the West Coast because of their ancestry.;D
I think fittingly, one of his career highlights in Congress was his leadership in the enactment of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which called for a formal apology and $20,000 in compensation to each Japanese American survivor of these internment camps.;D
He graduated from the University of California-Berkeley in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science in Business.;D
Upon his return, he entered the insurance business and became active in San Jose urban affairs.;D
He served on the San Jose Human Relations Commission and the San Jose Housing Authority prior to his tenure on the City Council.;D
In 1967, he was the first ethnic minority elected to the City Council and that began his string of firsts.;D
In 1971, he was elected Mayor of San Jose becoming the first Japanese American Mayor of a major city.;D
In 1974, he became the first Japanese American from the continental United States to be elected to the House of Representatives.;D
When he assumed the chairmanship of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, he became the first American of Asian ancestry to chair a major committee in the House.;D
Of course, should the Senate confirm his nomination as Commerce Secretary, he would become the first Asian American to serve in the President's cabinet.;D
The older I get, I find sometimes there are two kinds of people, problem makers and problem solvers.;N
I think his 21 years of experience on the Hill in a whole panoply of committee assignments, and particularly as Chairman of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, demonstrates a very solid knowledge of the interreaction between people and business.;D
He has the knowledge, he has the legislative background, he has the experience, and he has the ability, I think, to be a very fine Secretary of Commerce.;D
So Mr. Chairman, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I am here this morning simply to indicate my strong support and my hope, as you just stated, that this Committee will speedily process his confirmation.;N
I want to associate myself with the remarks of my senior Senator, and I will not be repetitive.;N
My heart is full of joy today and it is full of joy for Norm, for his family, for Asian Americans, for all Americans, because, Mr. Chairman, I know you know this and you believe this, that when we do open the door to all of our people we are such a better Nation.;N
What it means is that the door will be opened to so many others who might not have been considered.;N
I just want to say, when I served with Norm for 10 years in the House of Representatives, Senator Feinstein is right, a problem solver.;D
Mr. Chairman, I hope you will have the opportunity in the brief time that is left on this particular term to work with this fine, soon to be I hope Commerce Secretary, because in his district there are so many different points of view and so much diversity and so many Democrats, so many Republicans, independents.;N
He was able to bring everyone together, which is a wonderful trait, and make progress for everyone.;D
So Norm, you bring us joy today, and I am just pleased that you asked me to be here with you.;N
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: I am most privileged to be here this morning to join the distinguished Senators of California to support Norm Mineta for the office of Secretary of Commerce.;N
Here is a young man who, at a time when he was beginning to understand the complexities of society, had to leave his home with his parents to go to a desolate strange place in Wyoming called Hot Mountain, and there he spent nearly 2 years.;D
But instead of leading a life of gloom and bitterness, he returned home dedicated to serve his country.;D
As Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer have indicated, he served on the San Jose City Council, then became mayor and a distinguished member of the Congress.;D
I would associate myself with the glowing remarks of our distinguished witnesses and the opening statement that you made.;N
The American public will be fortunate again to have his service in their behalf as the Secretary of Commerce.;N
I enthusiastically support and endorse the nomination and, like you, Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that we can move this nomination as quickly as possible so that Mr. Mineta will be able to assume his duties and responsibilities on behalf of the American public.;N
On a personal note, having known him for 20 years, I am very pleased for him personally and his family.;N
I just pointed out to Senator Inouye, I have been on this Committee, Congressman Mineta--I guess I have to call you for the moment--I have heard many presentations of candidates, but I have never heard them give such a deep and emotional support for a candidate.;N
I share that view, and I share particularly the historical significance that Senator Inouye referred to.;N
He did not say that you are the first Asian American cabinet member, and he did not specifically talk about internments and injustices done, but they were in his comments and in his heart.;N
I think it is a powerful day that America becomes whole as you become the first Asian American to serve in the United States Cabinet.;D
During the course of questioning we will talk about steel, which you and I have discussed, the digital divide, and the whole question of spectrum division.;N
You have the toughness, the experience, the executive experience, the legislative experience, the personal nature of conflict resolution, bringing people together, the intensity of public service, the concept of public service which is so valuable and increasingly rare.;D
Although I think it lies in the hearts of all Americans, it is not manifested as it once was.;N
I am embarrassed on behalf of the Committee that there are not more of us here to join you.;N
It is a little bit like Internet access, having a computer in your home as opposed to just at the schools when that happened in every classroom.;N
It is almost like something is being built into your DNA, that you are predestined by the currents of the economy to make it or not and there comes to be very little that you can do about it, because this is not something that an individual can--I mean, sure, somebody from southern West Virginia can decide, well, I am going to go to Carnegie Mellon University and become a real computer science pro.;N
Cisco has Cisco Academies all over the country, all over the world, trying to do their best.;N
So I really understand it when people talk about the digital divide as being the next civil rights movement, with all of the passions and the dangers and in many ways, since much of the civil rights movement was nonviolent based upon that philosophy, this will not necessarily be that way, because we are not just talking about America here.;N
We are talking about the African subcontinent that the chairman was speaking about, others across the world who do not have this.;N
If they are denied technology and they feel that it is built into their DNA, so to speak, that there is no way out for them and therefore they are condemned to low wages and a life of poverty--and I think this will happen unless intervention is made on a massive scale--that they will resort to using the very technology that they do not have against those who do have it.;N
I think this is the whole question of international terrorism in a new form, where people are simply angry because they have been systemically and predictably left out and can see that from a very early age.;N
I will pass and simply submit my question on spectrum management to you in the interest of time.;N
But there is simply no way for me to talk strongly enough about what I think the digital divide is in the process of doing to this country.;N
I see it in the State of New Mexico that you referred to a few moments ago, and many other rural areas.;N
I see it in broadband where Bell Atlantic, which is our phone company, has broadband plans, but they have it for 5 of our 55 counties and they are all contiguous and they are where all the people are and where all the people of wealth are.;N
But the counties like Calhoun County, where you have 26 to 30 percent unemployment, rural areas, which in a State which is 96 percent mountainous is obviously preordained, too, they have no part.;N
We will make every effort to do it before the recess, and I know that the other members of the Committee will join in that.;N
So I will not make that my closing comment because I see our friend Senator Ashcroft here.;N
Well, Secretary Daley had communicated to me in a document that was a fact sheet that outlined the staffing and other things.;N
The second issue I want to address is a little broader than China and, frankly, I have a China trade enforcement bill called the Show-Me Act.;N
I will be looking for ways to raise the issues in my bill in the context of the PNTR debate, but if I can get a commitment from the administration that you would pursue these principles of enforcement in a broader context in the WTO then I think that would be more appropriate than simply focusing on China.;N
It is my belief that the U.S. has lost a measure of its leverage or its enforcement capacity in the WTO to get actual implementation of cases that we have won in the WTO, that we frequently will litigate an offense against the United States or its businesses in the context of the dispute resolution mechanisms provided for in WTO, we get the decision, but the enforcement measures provided for as a result of the decision do not really get us compliance.;N
So that the decisionmaking process ends up in sort of authorizing continued noncompliance upon the payment of a certain fee, which is the fine or the penalty.;N
So that in my judgment in many respects the WTO has become a way to license noncompliance by paying a fee, rather than to enforce compliance.;N
I think one of the problems that exists here is that the standards for leverage or retaliation or response to noncompliance once determined in the setting of dispute resolution, the standards have changed.;N
In 1947 the standard was that you had response or leverage or retaliation ``appropriate in the circumstances to achieve the objective,'' the objective being the purpose of the free trade or access to the market or to make sure that the agreement was enforced.;N
Under the GATT 1947, article 23, paragraph 2, it authorizes ``suspension of such concessions or other obligations under this agreement as they are determined to be appropriate in the circumstances,'' and GATT case law says this standard must be liberal enough ``to achieve the objective.'';N
Now, in 1994 under the WTO the standard for enforcement was changed and it was a standard that was equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment.;N
The dispute settlement understanding, article 22.4, says that the suspension level must be ``equivalent'' to the level of nullification or impairment.;N
Now, in the U.S.-EU banana case, for example, the equivalency test is strictly interpreted.;N
This 1994 change has affected our rights--in Europe, $120 million over 10 years to try to enforce the beef case we have been trying to enforce, and we still do not have access to the European market for American beef.;N
The banana retaliation was whittled down by the WTO from a $520 million U.S. request down to a $191 million situation.;N
It seems to me that we need to have robust enforcement for these trade agreements or else the trade agreements do not really achieve their intended purpose.;N
I noted that in the Far East in the not too far distant past we were able to get compliance by China in terms of our intellectual property demands by having robust threats for enforcement, and you are very familiar with their piracy, prevalent piracy at one time, of the intellectual property of the folks from your home district.;N
But we threatened $4.6 billion of retaliation over the last 5 years to enforce those property rights and, frankly, that has worked.;N
As we move from non-WTO status to WTO status, we give up some of our other capacity to determine the levels of our own retaliation.;N
So without belaboring the question, I would like to invite your ideas about whether you think it might be possible for or whether you think it would be wise to pursue a way for these trade agreements to be enforced, trade agreements to be enforced in ways that are sufficient to get us to a place of compliance with the agreement, rather than being enforced at a level which provides basically a license that can be purchased with a fine that is a basis for noncompliance.;N
What I was really saying was this, that under the non-WTO framework we have been successful in eliciting compliance when we had the robust leverage potential of 301.;N
And if we give that up going into the WTO, which has proved to be, at least as it relates to our access to European markets for beef, our access to European markets for fresh fruit, that in each of those cases it has been notably deficient.;N
I want to, really want to have the assurance that the administration cares about the deficiency, recognizes it, and would be eager to work toward improving our ability not just to have some enforcement, which results more in just the perpetuation of the noncompliance, but to have a kind of enforcement that will get us to the place where the agreements we negotiated will be the terms and conditions under which we live.;N
We appreciate your continuation in public service and your willingness to, as Shakespeare said, take the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.;D
Let me just say, being on the Commerce Committee here and seeing the transition from just commerce to e-commerce, I know the FTC gets involved and the FCC gets involved in e-commerce.;N
What do you see as the role of maybe the Commerce Department in the near future in terms of e-commerce?;N
Are there some rules of the road that have applied to commerce in general, especially interstate commerce, for the last say 100 years or so that we might want to consider as we look at e-commerce, or is this such a new baby that we better take hands off until we see how things progress?;N
Ultimately, do you see that maybe government might have some kind of backstop role, some kind of fundamental role here in maybe guaranteeing privacy or working out some accommodation vis a vis the Internet taxation?;N
We will be certainly looking to you for your guidance and your continued leadership on these and other issues.;N
I just want to thank you again for your willingness to serve and I look forward to working with you.;N
You certainly have my support in your confirmation and I am proud to see the President nominate you.;N
But what I would propose to do here is to have Dr. Bailey, after Frank Lautenberg has said what he wants to say, to have you make your statement.;N
So now it is in all of our interests to listen to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.;N
Knowing how much you and I like our particular phase of public service, it then makes me feel pretty good when I have a chance to introduce someone who can help us serve the public as they ought to be served.;D
I am pleased to introduce her, Mr. Chairman, to the Committee, and ask for expeditious treatment, so that she can do the job that we desperately want to have done.;N
But when we look at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, we know that we have got an important task there.;N
It is the agency that is responsible for the safety of millions of American motorists and their families.;N
It sets performance standards for motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, investigates safety defects, helps states reduce the threat of drunk drivers, researches driving behavior--that has got to be an endless pursuit--and promote the use of safety seatbelts and airbags.;N
We have just been through what is a wrenching experience for all of America, and for those of us in Government as well, when we look at the controversy now that exists over the tire failures and the dispute between Firestone and Ford.;N
I watched Dr. Bailey's testimony in the Appropriation Subcommittee on Transportation and it was just excellent.;N
A distinguished Senator from Florida who has wandered in, obviously thinking this was another room, to present somebody.;N
There are so many great Americans out there, but all of them do not have a chance to serve in this very demanding capacity.;D
She is responsible for the health of 8.2 million military personnel and oversaw a $16 billion defense health program.;D
She incorporated the President's Patients Bill of Rights into military medicine, and bolstered the role of preventive medicine in the U.S. Armed Forces.;D
She is a graduate of the University of Maryland and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathy, completed her internship at George Washington University and did her residency at Johns Hopkins University Hospital.;D
In deference to your time schedule and the vote that is underway, I would request permission to file my full statement for the record.;N
Mr. Chairman, Ms. Joyner does not have a family member in a biological sense, but she has Mr. Chris Hart who is a member of the Hillsborough County Commission and on the Hillsborough Aviation Authority.;N
I apologize for this most unorthodox way of conducting a short hearing after a very long hearing which is sometimes, I think, actually quite helpful because you can get into things.;N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing on this important position.;N
In 1991 Mary Sheila Gall was nominated to the Consumer Product Safety Commission by President George Bush.;D
The task of the CPSC is an important one, to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.;N
Between 1991 and 1999, Commissioner Gall voted with the majority of the three-member Commission the vast majority of times, supported the Commission's enforcement actions, and sought substantial fines and criminal penalties against companies that violated the Consumer Product Safety Act and other statutes enforced by the CPSC.;D
During this time, Commissioner Gall also cast a number of votes that have since become the focus of efforts to derail her nomination.;D
In 1992, Commissioner Gall voted with both of her colleagues against a rulemaking to put choking hazard labels on marbles, balloons, and small toys.;D
One year later she voted, again unanimously, not to begin a rulemaking on baby walkers, opting instead to urge the continued improvement of the product through voluntary standards.;D
In 1994, Commissioner Gall voted, again with the majority, not to begin a rulemaking on baby bath seats after a petition to ban them was filed.;D
Also in 1994, in response to a petition filed by the National Association of State Fire Marshals, Commissioner Gall voted not to begin a rulemaking on upholstered furniture flammability standards.;D
That time it was to modify the standards for children's sleepwear so as not to require sleepwear for children under 9 months or snug-fitting sleepwear to be flame resistant.;N
Gall reasoned that parents were putting their children in untreated, more comfortable loose cotton garments rather than the fire-resistant fabrics and that it was safer for children to sleep in snug, untreated pajamas, which were less likely to catch fire.;D
Since then, Chairman Brown has agreed that the CPSC should not expend additional resources to reconsider this 1996 action.;N
That same year, Commissioner Gall voted, this time in the minority, not to initiate a rulemaking on crib slats, commenting that the voluntary standards process had not been given time to work, but cautioning that regulation might still be required if the voluntary process proved inadequate.;D
After casting all of these votes, for which she is now being portrayed as a cold-hearted industry pawn, in 1999--in 1999 Commissioner Gall was renominated to a second 7-year term by President Bill Clinton.;D
On June 17th, 1999, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on the nomination, during which I was the only member of the Committee to pose questions.;N
On June 23rd, 1999, the Committee recommended by voice vote, with no audible dissension, that Ms. Gall's nomination be favorably reported to the full Senate.;D
On July 1, by unanimous consent and without a single statement of opposition or concern being entered into the record, Mary Sheila Gall was reconfirmed to a second full term at the CPSC.;D
Earlier this year, President Bush indicated his intent to nominate Commissioner Gall to Chair of the CPSC.;D
The Senate has already unanimously concurred on Ms. Gall's qualifications to be the CPSC Commissioner.;D
I believe that the President is entitled to his prerogative to select the Chairman and that the Senate should in most instances defer to his judgment.;N
I also believe the President has made a good choice with Commissioner Gall, who during her tenure at the CPSC has demonstrated her commitment to reason, to fair process, and to safety.;D
What I do not believe, however, is the line that Commissioner Gall's opponents have developed recently to justify their opposition to her, and this line is that Mary Sheila Gall, while perfectly fine as a CPSC Commissioner, is not qualified to chair the Commission.;D
It is a collegial body whose agenda and budget are set by all three Commissioners, all of whom have an equal vote in rulemakings and enforcement actions.;N
It is because the Commissioners must work so closely that Commissioner Thomas Moore, a Democrat who has been at the CPSC since 1995, has come to know her philosophy and work intimately.;D
It is Commissioner Moore who offers what is in my mind the most persuasive commentary on her nomination.;N
In response to an article that appeared in USA Today earlier this year, Commissioner Moore wrote: ``I was dismayed to read the article in the April 25th USA Today giving an unfairly negative slant to the record and beliefs of Mary Sheila Gall, my fellow Commissioner at the Consumer Product Safety Commission.'';D
He continued: ``During my 6 years at the agency, I have been impressed by Commissioner Gall's hard work, the thoughtful consideration of every issue, and been persuaded on occasion by her arguments.;D
For her part, she has been willing to change her views after hearing her colleagues on certain matters.;D
But whether we agree on an issue of note, I can find nothing in her views or her voting record to cause me any alarm about her assuming the chairmanship of the agency.'';D
Finally, he said: ``While I may have a different opinion from Commissioner Gall on some aspects of Commission business, I have no doubt she will listen to my views and that, however she votes, her decision will be well-reasoned and give expression to a valid viewpoint shared by many, perhaps the majority of Americans.'';D
I commend Ms. Gall for her service to the CPSC and to this country and I commend her also for her willingness to face the tough, but I hope fair, questions she will be asked today.;D
Could I just say, Mr. Chairman, you have always treated every nominee in my knowledge in my years of experience with you in a fair and objective fashion, and I appreciate that and I know that the witness does today.;N
Mr. Chairman, I will wrap up with this, by way of saying that certainly, Ms. Gall, there are examples where the federal government has overreached in a variety of areas, but when you use the words ``federal Nanny State'' in a lot of quarters that is code for saying that there should not be an activist role for the government in the consumer protection area.;N
I think there are a number of issues that need to be explored, but I will tell you, to vote for you I need to be confident that your philosophy is not incompatible with the basic mission of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect the consumer, kids, seniors, and others, because otherwise we are talking about bringing a fox into the henhouse, and that is something I cannot support.;N
Mr. Chairman, thanks for calling this hearing today, and I am pleased to lend my support to the President's nominee, Mary Sheila Gall, as Chairwoman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.;N
It should be noted that Commissioner Gall has a distinguished record of public service, having served her country for almost 30 years in many executive and legislative branch positions.;D
Commissioner Gall has also extensive experience with consumer safety issues, having served as Commissioner since 1991, and as Vice Chairman of the Commission for the past 5 years.;D
Commissioner Gall also served as Assistant Commission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the first Bush Administration, where she worked closely on issues affecting children, families, and the disabled.;D
I will be very brief because I am looking forward to the opportunity to ask the witness questions.;N
The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in my judgment, plays an enormously important role in this country, providing protection for consumers from products that are unsafe and particularly providing protection for those who cannot protect themselves, young children and babies.;N
Obviously, the Chairman of that commission has an elevated responsibility over the other commission members.;N
I am still open-minded, still willing to listen to and interested in listening to your answers to questions.;N
I do have to tell you, Ms. Gall, I have reservations, though, and those reservations grow out of some instances in your record where it appears that fairly minor changes could have been made in products that would have made them safer, would have protected kids, and your reaction seems to have been to find the responsibility with others--parents, adults.;D
I just have to tell you, I do not think--and I agree only with part of what my colleague from Nevada just said.;N
If they are exposed to a product that could by reasonable means be made safer, that would keep them from being hurt, I do not think that and parental responsibility are mutually exclusive.;N
We ought to do everything in our power to make sure parents are properly educated about the dangers associated with products.;N
I think the Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission has an enormous responsibility to those children who cannot protect themselves, and anything that can reasonably be done to make a product safe ought to be done.;N
It appears to me from looking at what I have seen so far, but I want us to talk about it, that thousands of children have been injured by products that you did not believe were defective, that you did not believe needed to be changed.;N
I do have serious reservations because of the reasons I have just stated, but I look forward to asking questions.;N
It is my privilege to introduce an outstanding Virginian from McLean, Fairfax County, Mary Sheila Gall, for your consideration.;N
I know you already have been considering her for Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as Chair.;N
I know many remarks, Senator Ensign and Senator McCain, have mentioned some of the things in here.;N
This is obviously a hearing on consumer protection and I want to make sure it is not witness protection needed in this.;N
Listening to Senator McCain--excuse me--Senator Edwards, I think that you will find in Mary Sheila Gall somebody who does balance needs.;D
Yes, consumer protection needs to be an issue that clearly the government has a role in warning and making sure products are safe, and then there is also obviously a parental responsibility.;N
You know, Virginia style peanuts, many of which are grown in North Carolina as well, are the best and the largest peanuts.;N
But trying to promote those peanuts in Great Britain with KP Foods, they say, we have a hard time getting mothers to buy peanuts for their kids.;N
They say, well, there is a government warning label that we have to put on all these packages that says small children may choke on these contents, which makes mothers very worried about them giving their children peanuts.;N
The Virginia style peanuts grown in eastern North Carolina and Virginia, of course, being the biggest, are probably even more of a danger.;N
And I said: You know, in the United States our mothers and parents tell kids to chew their food before they swallow it.;N
But nevertheless, those warning labels end up having an impact on the export of our products.;N
But regardless of all that, that little instruction in British consumer protection harming young children, not being able to eat nutritious peanuts because of the fear of the warning label.;N
Ms. Gall received her bachelor's degree, Mr. Chairman, from Rosary Hill College in Buffalo, New York, and, more importantly, her master's degree in special education from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.;D
Let us try to address a couple of the issues that have been raised, Ms. Gall, in the time that I have.;N
The question has been raised about a letter to the editor of October 12, 1999, in which you referred to certain Commission activities as ``proclamations issued by this agency on behalf of the federal Nanny State.'';N
You have been criticized for voting not to bring a rulemaking on bunk bed entrapment hazards.;D
It has been said you relied on a legal technicality to avoid providing needed protection for children who were dying as a result of getting stuck in the bunk bed railing.;D
I am very pleased that Commissioner Moore is here today and we appreciate you being here, Commissioner Moore, and the rest of the staff.;N
And I believe it was because you were not sure that baby bath seats were safer or less safe than not using one.;D
Do you have any answer yet to the question of whether drownings occur at a higher rate when baby bath seats are not used?;N
I do not want to break in line here, but I do have a statement I would like to submit for the record, and I do want to say how pleased I am to offer my support to Mary Sheila Gall.;N
I have known her for a long time and I appreciate the work she has done and the service she has given to her country.;D
I also appreciate the kind of person she is as an individual and her work on things unrelated to her government service on issues such as adoption.;D
The fact that she has two adopted children is a side of her personality that people do not really see, so I wanted to mention that.;D
From the period of 1990 to 1998 the Commission received reports of 89 bunk bed-related deaths.;N
Of this number, 64 percent involved entrapment, 24 involved children being hung from the beds by objects such as clothing, bedding, and belts, and another 8 were falls from the beds.;N
CPSC's statistical survey found that about 31,400 children were treated in emergency rooms for bunk bed-related injuries.;N
Now, although there was a voluntary standard in place, to which you have referred, the field staff visited 55 retail outlets in 39 cities, examining 58 manufacturers' bunk bed models, and they made the following findings: Of the 58 models, 23 were found to be in noncompliance with the voluntary standard.;N
Five manufacturers were discovered to have significant entrapment hazards associated with their products, three of whom, more than 50 percent, were clearly aware of their voluntary standard.;N
You said: ``Our statute provides that the `Commission shall not promulgate' a mandatory rule unless an existing voluntary standard: 1) `is not likely to result in elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury' or 2) is `not likely' to have `substantial compliance.' '' You then hung your decision, the sole dissenting vote, on the notion that you thought there was at least it appears, presumptive, of substantial compliance.;N
"The law says ``it would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and''--not ``or''; ``and''--``is likely there will be substantial compliance.''";N
So your decision was based on only substantial compliance when the staff in fact recommended that children are dying, they are being seriously injured in high numbers in the presence of the voluntary standard, and that evidence was sufficient because it was not accomplishing what the law said, doing away with the injury.;D
"How do you justify, number one, misinterpreting the law; number two, ignoring the evidence of the Commission with respect to the injuries that were continuing to be committed?";N
Well, with all due respect, Ms. Gall, I am sorry to interrupt you, but you are not, in fact, answering my question.;N
"Well, because for the following four reasons: because the staff said, number one, by making it mandatory it would allow them to pursue civil penalties for violations; number two, it would facilitate the recall of defective beds; number three, it would increase compliance; and number four, it would prevent the importation of noncomplying beds by foreign manufacturers--all four of which things you could not do under the voluntary---- ";N
If two members of the Commission were prepared to move to mandatory and the staff was saying overwhelmingly we are not protecting these children adequately, the voluntary standard has not worked over 8 years, but you hung your hat on a substantial compliance concept, erroneously putting it into one segment of a two-part law.;N
Now, indeed percentages are statistics, but for the 10 percent, you can have 10 percent of a large number of people which is too many of our children being submitted to a particular risk.;N
What I want to make sure is that if you are Chair of this Commission that you are willing to at least investigate--I am not talking about what the remedy is--to at least investigate whether or not product shortcomings are part of the problem as well, because in three proceedings you said you would not even take the initial steps to investigate whether there are product shortcomings.;N
My second question to you is would you approach your job differently if you are confirmed as Chair than you did, say, as a member?;N
Everybody has got a right to change, and I have certainly made changes on my views over the years.;N
But, I would like to have you say for the record whether you are going to handle your position as Chair the way you handled your assignment during your previous 10 years.;N
I only want to say, Ms. Gall, what troubles me is that when we create this balance between consumer use and product shortcoming, it still looks to me like your reaction is going to be to first blame the consumer rather than to initiate an effort to examine whether product shortcomings are part of this as well.;N
Having come and gone, I am not sure what was being covered, but I think everything from car seats to bunk beds have been.;N
Let me ask you something that is maybe not in the various safety matters, but I was looking at your response to the second question as far as the top three challenges facing the Commission.;N
The first one that you brought up was ``The Commission needs to improve consumer product safety by harmonizing international consumer product safety standards,'' and more participation with the technical staff and so forth.;N
Then you get into ``leveraging of existing resources of government by strategic alliances with other government organizations that have an existing international presence.'';N
I was reading on the issues as far as international trade, and I read just yesterday how there is actually some pretty good positive comments coming out of Great Britain with the U.S. counterpart on having not just a NAFTA for North America, but having the Americas and Europe harmonizing trade, which would be beneficial, I think clearly beneficial to Americans, to be able to get our products into Europe.;N
There are some very good products out of France and Germany and Britain and the Netherlands, the Swiss, and Austria and elsewhere that we would like as well.;N
Now, the key to that I think, in the event that there is that harmonization and that we can get our products easily into Europe and European countries can get their products into our country, clearly one of the things that they talked about is the safety standards.;N
You made that a number one priority, which I think is very good because it means jobs and opportunities for this country.;D
How do you see your agency or this agency or this Commission working with your European counterparts?;N
Where would you see any problems or where do you see--do you think that their regulations of consumer protection would be so difficult that we could not be able to agree with them, or do you see that as fairly easy, although with some negotiations, in harmonizing their safety standards with those of the United States?;N
I think that what you will find in this area is that sometimes you will find that the industry, wanting to enter say the European market or the Europeans wanting to enter our market, whether it is on tractors or chain saws or appliances or whatever it may be, they are going to agree to maybe a stricter standard because they just want to please everyone with it, but it is good for business and it is good for consumers as well.;N
So your voluntary approaches may have industry actually saying, here is what we want to do, which is maybe further than we may want to constrain them.;N
Ms. Gall, I am going to make a couple of comments and then at the end I am going to ask a question about recalls and your philosophy on that.;N
I want to pick up on what you said about an example you gave of a drunk mother--it could be a drunk mother or a drunk father--who puts a child, let us say, in a baby bath seat, walks downstairs and, to use your example, forgets about the child and so on.;N
That child should not be punished because that poor little innocent has a neglectful parent, mother or father.;N
You have said to me privately, and you repeat it today, you voted 97 percent of the time with the other Commissioners.;D
Most of them are noncontroversial, Mr. Chairman, such as voting to publish a notice in the Federal Register, appoint staff, accept settlement agreements, or to commend a company for taking certain actions.;N
"You say that; on the other hand, you said in your testimony before this very Committee in 1999 when you were up to be back on the Commission, quote, quote from you: ``The other Commissioners and I do not always agree.";N
Sometimes you do not agree with them and now you say you agree with them, and I am very, very troubled by this conflict.;N
I want to talk to you about this education campaign that the Commission embarked upon to let parents know that if they do take a child into bed with them there are certain risks.;N
It just let parents know that there are 64 deaths every year from suffocation and strangulation when this occurs.;N
Now, clearly it is up to a parent, but I found that to be important for parents to think about.;N
You could roll over on a child, the child could slip down between the mattress and the guard rail.;N
In which you wrote, among other things, and let me quote it directly: ``Infant sleeping study, a case of agency's overreaching.'';N
You wrote, and I am just quoting because of time a couple of the things: ``Frankly, as the only current Republican member on the commission''--which I find--I did not think we think of ourselves when we are on a commission, but fine--``it has been increasingly frustrating''--your service on the Commission--``in recent years to witness the processing of proclamations issued by this agency on behalf of the federal Nanny State.'';N
 staffers for their initiative, I voted against proclaiming this to be an official CPSC study.''--in;N
You say: ``The only peril I can detect in this particular episode is over-reaching by a federal regulatory agency.'';N
Well, that is incredible to me when you look at the fact that there are 64 deaths each year, but the only peril you see is overreaching.;D
"I am a believer that information is very, very important, and I worry because, again, being on the Commission is one thing; being the Chair, you impact the staff, you have tremendous influence over the staff.";N
I worry about a chilling effect on the staff when they are told not to give information to the public.;N
Now, obviously people will make that decision, but you know, a breast-feeding mother might just say: I never thought of that, so I am going to bring my baby into bed with me and when I am done I am going to change that baby's diaper and put her back into her crib that has safety standards, and maybe that would in fact save lives--64 kids a year.;N
So it greatly troubles me that not only would you oppose the Commission informing parents, but you go so far as to write an op-ed piece mentioning that you were the only Republican and you are worried about the direction of the Commission.;D
"please correct me if I am wrong--that the way a recall works is the staff will recommend a recall and they will sit down with the product, the maker of the product, the manufacturer, and together they will come to some conclusion about a recall; is that correct?";N
Well, I had heard a tape of one of these discussions with the Commission, Mr. Chairman, where you, Ms. Gall, are talking about a baby walker.;N
It involved the Safety First baby walker, where children were getting their teeth caught in a seam on the handle of the baby walker.;N
What would happen is they would put their teeth down and literally their teeth would pop out and they would lose their teeth on this ``Safety First'' baby walker.;N
I was listening to your questions and I was frankly stunned, because your line of questioning was, and I am quoting directly from your question: ``The teeth we are talking about are baby teeth, right?;N
In other words, your whole approach to it was to sort of belittle the fact that these kids were losing their teeth, and we know that in fact if baby teeth are lost prematurely it impacts on the speech development of the child and all the rest.;N
My time has run out, so we can either ask you to respond to that baby teeth question or we can wait until the next round, Mr. Chairman.;N
You have corrected the record in a lot of instances in today's hearing and I think you are acquitting yourself quite well.;N
As a grandmother of five, I want to compliment you on the vote to rescind the infant sleepwear rule requiring that pajamas be flame-resistant and therefore polyester.;N
Our grandchildren have suffered from heat and have not worn pajamas at all because they are so hot in the summertime because they could not be all cotton.;N
I know that that has been twisted and made you to look like you were not for the flame-retardant safety.;N
You have, in fact, been able to look into it, get the facts, and determine that actually the flame-resistant sleepwear did not make that much of a difference.;N
I appreciate your willingness to stand up, and a lot of mothers and grandmothers in the southern States especially appreciate it in the summertime when they want cotton next to their children's bodies, not polyester.;N
Did you want to elaborate on your reasoning behind that and clarify what I think has been a distortion of your record on that point?;N
I just want to ask if you think common sense plays a role when you are in a regulatory position and where you would apply the common sense, as I think you did in this particular instance?;N
Are there places where you think common sense should be more a part of the regulatory processes that you as Chairman, if you are confirmed, would be able to affect?;N
My question to you is directly--I know we can cite examples, but I have given you two examples where some would argue that the redesign of a product can take into account the improper use of that product, and it is not going to be adequately supervised, that people are going to misuse the product.;N
Your position has been in those two cases that you feel that if the negligent use of the product caused the accident, we should not consider redesigning those products.;N
He made reference specifically to your dissenting vote against issuing a Federal safety standard for bunk beds.;D
The two of you talked about two components in the law that are necessary in order to find that a voluntary standard is adequate.;N
"The voluntary standard for bunk beds had been in place since 1992, I believe; is that correct?";N
The two requirements in the law, one of which you made reference to when you made your decision, was--;N
it is actually the second requirement--that there be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.;N
Some would argue that 630,000 recalls over the course of 7 or 8 years is not substantial compliance.;N
But, I want to focus on the first requirement, which is that you have to find that the voluntary standard would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury.;N
"My question to you is, did you find in making that decision and rendering that vote that there had been adequate compliance, number one; and number two, that the voluntary standard eliminated or adequately reduced the risk, even in the face of 50 some odd children dying while the voluntary standard was in place?";N
If children were dying during that period of time, whatever the number is, and maybe we could argue about that, but whatever the number is, if children died while the voluntary standard was in place--and in fact by 1999 it had been in place for 7 years--if children died during that period of time, from your perspective did that voluntary standard eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury?;N
Are you saying that all those children who died who fell in the categories you just talked about--none of the children who died would in fact have been covered by the standard?;N
For example, sitting two rows behind you is Lyn Starks, who lost her daughter, I think in 1997, her 3 year old child in 1997, 5 years after this voluntary standard had been put in place.;N
Would you say to her that this standard adequately protected her daughter from the risk of injury, excuse me, from this bunk bed?;N
Two of your colleagues apparently thought that it was important to have a mandatory standard.;N
They laid out the fact that 89 deaths had occurred, 57 by entrapment, that Ms. Starks had lost her child in 1997, her 3 year old daughter, 5 years after a voluntary standard had been put in place.;N
One of the responsibilities of the Commission is you have authority over whether or not to pursue legal action against companies that manufacture defective products, correct?;N
I want to ask you about an area that I do not think you have been asked about before, which is sprinklers, sprinklers to avoid fires, put out fires, sprinklers in homes, dormitories, hospitals, that sort of thing.;N
You opposed the filing of an administrative complaint, and I think you alone opposed it, against the sprinkler company that had been found to be manufacturing sprinklers that did not operate properly.;N
"They were in homes; they were in schools; they were in hospitals; they were in dormitories.";N
The result of the complaint, I think, was a resolution where a huge number of these defective sprinklers were recalled.;N
However, you were the sole dissenting vote against the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action against a company that had manufactured sprinklers, put them in homes, hospitals, dormitories, all over this country.;D
But, in fact, in this case there was, as a specific result of the action being filed by the Commission, which you opposed, there was a specific resolution recalling all of these defective sprinklers.;N
In the mean time, if you did not take legal action and you were just engaging in discussion, these sprinklers stay in place, these defective sprinklers stay in place, and the risk of families, students, and patients in hospitals being hurt as the result of a fire continues, does it not?;N
Is it your view that there are businesses out there that sell and run, that are flim-flam operations?;N
That is why we have criminal laws to go after those with criminal intent, and those things are ongoing.;N
But it is your experience that most in business are trying to produce products that are safe, affordable, and that serve their purpose, and they want to sell the American consumer not one day, but every day if they can?;N
I wonder if you can tell me, because I am new to this Committee, what difference will there be in your role as a member of the Commission, which I understand you will continue to be whether or not confirmed to be the Chairman or not.;N
What different role would you have, what influence change would you have, if you were the chair?;N
I think what every Senator who is going to vote on your confirmation is really struggling with is do you have a different threshold than other members of the Commission for when, or burden of proof, if you will, for when you regulate or when you resort to voluntary.;D
I asked your staff to provide us with examples of deaths of elderly Floridians particularly that were occasioned by space heaters and other kinds of unfortunate accidents.;N
I would like for you to talk to us a little bit about how you would propose to deal with a vulnerable population like the elderly.;N
What would you propose with regard to minority populations of elderly, where there is a language barrier?;N
I have sat here and listened to the dialog this morning, and what a novel thing it is to have a person up that has 10 years experience with the Commission and still has a sense of humor.;D
How novel it is to have product knowledge and understand the human being and still approach it with a common sense type thing of trying to solve problems without going into court.;N
I think there have been some examples here that have been pretty far-reaching this morning.;N
After listening--I sat here just to listen this morning more than to ask question, to be right honest with you, because I am not real sure after hearing all this that I could--we did not have bath seats for kids.;N
But I know that I guess when we lost our daughter when she was 15 years old and we had an unfortunate accident, I guess I could go through a lot of things and probably blame somebody else.;N
I know there are going to be three votes on that Commission and the desires of the Commission I would imagine will be seen by a majority of two to one.;N
But nonetheless, I am going to support this, and your answers, and just to keep approaching these problems under a common sense approach.;N
So I appreciate all the questions that everybody else asked and I am going to take that into consideration.;N
But I appreciate your positive attitude, approach to some very serious problems we have in product safety.;D
You know, I sat on the board of directors at one time of the Shriners Hospitals for Children.;N
No other organization in the world has done more research on burns than that organization.;N
When we looked at different circumstances that caused, after we dealt with it, what caused this thing and fire and fire retardants and this type thing, we finally came to the conclusion sometimes the fire retardant wear did more damage under certain circumstances than, say, just straight cotton in what we slept in as kids.;N
I just want to emphasize on my little minute here that we started with Love Canal and all the toxic fumes and disease and death that that caused up there in Buffalo, and we instituted the Environmental Protection Administration, and that saved a lot of law cases.;N
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has saved a lot of law cases as well as lives and injury.;N
While I have worked for some 34, almost 35, years now in the cancer field, it was not Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler.;N
Now, when I go to the tobacco-growing area of Florence, South Carolina, in the courthouse they have got no smoking.;N
But, it was not until we really brought that case and got that settlement that people understood the dangers of smoking.;N
I appreciate your having a second round, Mr. Chairman, because this is really a signal today about how the Administration is going to handle consumer protection issues and, frankly, I am very troubled about what we have heard in the last couple of hours.;N
When I and my colleagues have given you these examples of these cases where you essentially said it was the consumer's fault, your response has essentially been to cite extreme cases of individual irresponsibility.;N
excuse me, drunk parents this morning, and it seems to me that you are overlooking the significant role that the product is going to play in the vast majority of mainstream cases where the consumer has behaved responsibly.;N
But just so we are clear now, and I would like you to respond to the question, that is not what your record shows.;N
Your record shows that you will not even begin the inquiry, and you cite this question of extreme irresponsibility for not beginning the inquiry.;D
Could you give some examples in the last 10 years where you opposed an industry position that industry felt strongly about?;N
But the witness has said that in 10 years at the Consumer Product Safety Commission she voted against industry in one instance.;D
I want to wrap up with this, Mr. Chairman, because I think this is right at the heart of the question.;N
What has troubled me the most about what you have said today and in the past is that when you will not even initiate an inquiry in most instances you cannot get industries to the table in order to start looking for these kind of practical solutions.;D
Yet, when we try to educate parents about placing their children in adult beds, you not only oppose it, but you write a letter to the editor and you condemn the Commission staff.;D
I think it is important that my daughter knows of this problem, and she can make her own choice on how she wants to deal with it.;N
You can have an opinion, but then you write an op-ed piece striking out at the staff for what they did, saying the only issue here was overreaching.;N
I simply think these inconsistencies are very, very troubling, and I do not believe that you will educate the elderly because you did not want to educate the kids or even a grandma who might take her grandchild into bed when there is an infant involved.;D
Now, you then say, in response to Senator Edwards' questions about the sprinkler, oh, you did not want to take that issue on because it takes too long.;D
So your point that, oh, when you issue a complaint it takes a lot of time, is disproved by the facts.;N
I think, Mr. Chairman, we have a witness here who is recasting herself and saying, well, 97 percent I voted with the Commission, I only voted twice against administrative actions, complaints, when in fact there were only 3 in the last 8 years, to make us believe that she is in the mainstream.;N
Now, we got this information from the Commission staff, that there were only 3 in the last 8 years.;N
You voted against a rule for baby walkers because caregivers were failing to provide ``adequate supervision.'';D
"We have gone over that, and I have told you I agree we want to give adequate supervision to our children; but a child does not choose its parents and if there is a real problem and the parent does not supervise, we want the safest products possible for the child, to protect the child.";N
You know, with the bunk beds you said the parents should not put the kids in the upper bunk.;N
As a result, you voted against a rule for baby walkers and yet the injuries dropped 60 percent in 5 years as a result of the redesign.;N
Mr. Chairman, anyone who knows anything knows the reason industry sat down was because of that rulemaking.;N
We have the safest products in the world because we have people who serve on these commissions who care, who are fiercely fighting.;N
And when they slack off, we do have trial lawyers what come in, much maligned as they are.;N
We have the safest products in the world because we have a system that protects consumers.;N
If we have the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Mr. Chairman, who is anything less than vigilant and a fighter and an advocate--Ms.;N
But to make you the head of this Commission, it seems to me to be wrong, because we need a fighter.;N
We need someone who is going to get out there and advocate, not someone who says, well, the rulemaking had nothing the do with the fact that the people came to the table.;N
Knowing that 11,600 kids each year--let me correct that--11,300 injuries to babies have been avoided, would you still vote against that rulemaking?;N
But, I want to point out that as of this point in a direct question, Ms. Gall refused to answer would she cast the same vote.;N
Because the other Commissioners had the guts to say that 11,300 injuries a year to babies is too much to take.;N
What troubles me tremendously is the fact that you voted against agency action on the bath seats, again claiming negligent parents.;N
While your primary reason for opposing the rule was to defer to voluntary standards, which had not worked, and the record will show that, you also voiced your views that the real cause of death was the parents inappropriately placing children under 4 years old in the upper bunks.;D
I do not want to do anything on my watch that is going to punish children because they cannot read the warnings or is going to punish elderly people because maybe they are not as swift as they once had been.;N
I think, if anything, we can see here that, while someone may provide a balance on a commission as a commissioner--and I do not question your integrity in any way.;N
You believe that industry should fix itself, you believe that parents are to blame, and that is what you believe and you have a right to believe it.;D
You do not believe in doing what it takes to make products safe, and you would rather let it go to industry to deal with it.;N
I think that is a problem when considering your nomination to be the Chairman of a commission whose mission is making products as safe as they can be.;N
Let me first thank our regular Chairman, Senator McCain, for his leadership, in showing that a 50/50 divided Senate can work together as a unit.;N
And our regular Chairman has been outgoing in wanting to move things along and get things done.;N
It is not to get into partisan struggle to see who is on top and who can get the most publicity.;N
First, we do not have the Office of Government Ethics report from the financial statement you submitted.;D
And it could be that some of the predictive Members on both sides who have yet to be announced next week would want to be able to meet with you, Mr. Evans, and ask some questions, particularly about the census.;N
And we will find then if Chairman McCain at that time in the week of January 22 wants to hold a further hearing before we move to confirmation in this Committee.;N
Before yielding to Chairman McCain as mentioned, I have cut my opening statement down to respect our time limits and because I have had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Evans to go over the matter of manufacturing.;N
And there is one other thing that we did not get to touch upon that I ought to cover here in an opening statement.;N
But be that as it may, we have got a wonderful happening down there in Vincente Fox's election.;N
And rather than to pass through money and the Wall Street bankers operating the policy toward Mexico, we can develop, as President Fox has indicated, a common market.;N
They taxed themselves some $5 billion before they allowed Greece and Portugal to come into the Common Market.;N
You've got to have not only free elections, but labor rights, property rights, a respected judiciary.;N
Rather than sending money down to go back to Wall Street, which has been the case over the many years, we want to help build that infrastructure and really solve that immigration, solve that drug problem, and bring up their economy so that it is relatively competitive with ours.;N
So I want to make sure that we not only enforce our trade laws, but we make sure that they work.;N
It is just an outpouring of manufacturing jobs down there because we as politicians at this particular level say ``Before we open up Evans manufacturing, you have got to have clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing, parental leave, safe working place, safe machinery.'';N
All of that goes into the cost of production, and they do not even have a good minimum wage down there.;N
I want to thank you for your continued cooperation, including holding this confirmation hearing.;N
I think it is both significant and traditional on your part that you would agree to hold this hearing at this early time.;D
I would also like to mention that I was thinking this morning this begins our fifth year of working together.;N
I appreciate that very much, and I look forward to the opportunity in the next 2 years of working together as we have in the past.;N
In his acceptance remarks following the President's nomination, Mr. Evans laid out his vision and priorities for the Commerce Department.;N
They include the promotion of free enterprise, first in America and then abroad, the free flow of capital, and free and open competition.;N
At the outset, I want to applaud what I take to be Mr. Evans' emphasis on free and fair trade.;D
The rapid rise of the Internet is just one of the more recent factors that makes a global economy an undeniable reality.;N
Erecting and enforcing trade barriers between and among individual countries is simply the wrong policy to pursue.;N
Established procedures, rather than retaliatory trade actions, are available to ensure trade is fair.;N
Turning to the Department's responsibility for the census, we all know that the issue of statistical sampling is controversial, and has been deemed unconstitutional strictly for census counting purposes.;N
This issue is important to me as well as many other Members of the Committee because traditional counting methods do not provide an accurate count of the population in my home State of Arizona, and Arizona citizens have suffered as a result.;N
I look forward to Mr. Evans' comments on his plans to ensure an accurate census count, especially in those locations where there have been documented undercounts in the past.;D
I believe that one of the most important missions of the Commerce Department is to remain politically neutral.;N
Commerce Secretaries Daley and Mineta made great strides in reducing the political emphasis of the Department.;N
Mr. Evans, I hope and expect that you will strive to continue and improve upon their efforts.;D
Charges include allegations that seats on foreign trade missions were ``sold'' to major donors, and that Commerce Department officials were directly involved in political fundraising.;N
Mr. Evans, your vigilance will be essential to ensure that the Department remains true to its publicly stated mission, rather than an agenda that merely promotes political interests.;D
Your business experience speaks for itself as you face the challenging management task ahead of you.;D
I am going to endorse the statements made by our two chairmen here this morning, and welcome you to the Committee.;N
But I first want to thank both you and Senator McCain for setting a terrific example for the Senate.;N
And I appreciate the fact that this Committee is meeting today in a way that I hope paves the way for people to understand, particularly when you look at the last years of record of this Committee, how effective bipartisanship cooperation can be.;N
And I think it shows that no one has anything to fear from some of the proposals that are on the table for our cooperative effort.;N
And by the way, over the holidays, from your remarks, I had an opportunity to drive through South Carolina and North Carolina.;N
And I am delighted on this appointment, by the way, and our visit with Mr. Evans and to welcome him here this morning.;N
We realize that public service is sometimes not too keenly sought after among successful people that we need to get into government and they bring a certain amount of expertise to government that we certainly need.;N
commerce and the information age, those new technologies do not recognize national or international borders.;N
So the NTIA is a very important part of the Commerce Department, and how we foresee new technologies into areas where the majority of Americans can take advantage of those.;N
Also, an important area that I just want to bring to your attention is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).;N
NIST is sometimes overlooked, and I would like to recognized that institution up the road here in Maryland.;N
And from Eureka, Montana to Alzada, Montana, flying like a crow flies, maybe a little straighter, it is further than it is from Chicago to Washington, D.C.;N
That is the land mass and you understand land mass as far as the State is concerned and so does my friend here on my right.;N
So whenever we talk about recognizing population and the representation in this Congress, I think I have got a pretty good argument.;N
And I found you, frankly, even on first meeting, to be very direct, very candid, very pragmatic.;D
Let me just make three quick points which we discussed, and one of which I will ask a further question on.;N
It is not impossible that very shortly about 50 percent of the steel industry in the United States will be in bankruptcy or in financial comparable status.;N
Vice President-elect Dick Cheney came to Weirton, West Virginia, and said that there could not be a defense industry without a steel industry.;N
I just need to say that even though it may create tensions within the administration, there really is, in terms of the steel industry, a need for the Bush Administration to intervene quickly.;N
But this is a genuine, genuine crisis for the industry and for all of the people that work within it.;N
Second, there are three quick technology issues, one of which Senator Conrad Burns, my good friend, has already mentioned.;N
The first I would mention would be the question of the digital divide which has almost become a cliche, but which is becoming in my judgment not only a severe, more severe, problem, even as we work to expand our technology infrastructure within States, within the country, and obviously even more dramatically, within the world.;N
Also, there is an interesting program called the TOP program which is the Technology Opportunities Program.;N
Hardly anybody has heard of it, but it makes an enormous difference to States and to regions which would otherwise be under-served in a very dramatic way.;N
And third, something we discussed yesterday, the EPSCOT program, which is the technology equivalent of taking not just University of Texas where you graduated from, in other words, the first tier universities--excuse me, Senator Gramm--among others, and the Stanfords and the Harvards, et cetera.;N
But going to first-rate, second level universities where first-rate research is being done by first-;N
And I think it represents one of the truly important challenges for you and for your department and for the country's success as you go into your new job.;N
Very finally, another rather obscure program, but we have to protect our information infrastructure.;N
And you have within your Bureau of Export Administration a program called the Critical Infrastructure Assurance office.;N
Having said that, I do not want people to come back here in 5 years with us in shambles in this whole area and asking why it was that we did not do something when we have the ability within your department to take action on that.;N
I think your qualifications will give you an opportunity to excel in this particular role.;D
But I do want to say that I am very interested in the issues of technology, the NTIA, the work it is doing, third-generation wireless.;N
There are so many interesting and critically important things that are being done in these areas.;N
And I want to mention that Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and myself authored legislation that created a trade deficit review commission.;N
And one of the things I said is we need to devote more resources to monitoring compliance with trade agreements.;N
The President should request more resources for Commerce's market access and compliance unit.;N
You know how many people over in Commerce are involved in monitoring our trade relationship with China with respect to enforcement?;N
The largest trade deficit--the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country and growing rapidly.;N
I will not continue further except to say a number of our colleagues have talked about this and it is very important.;N
And as you come to this job and this opportunity, I know you will pay some attention to it from our discussion yesterday.;N
Again, thank you for being willing to serve our country and I look forward to supporting your nomination.;N
May I just say what a pleasure it is to be here with Mr. Evans and our distinguished colleagues from the great state of Texas.;N
I feel that this hearing is a harbinger of good things to come and bipartisan cooperation on behalf of our country and behalf of our federal government.;N
And I too want to join my colleagues here today in welcoming you, Mr. Evans, to this Committee and to congratulate you as well on your nomination as Secretary of Commerce by President-elect Bush.;N
I also want to say you are in good company here today with our colleagues Senator Gramm and Senator Hutchison.;N
It is certainly clear from your background and your experience that you bring a broad range and expertise to the position for which you have been selected.;N
As others have indicated here today, the Department of Commerce has a broad range of jurisdiction among a number of agencies.;N
There is every indication that you possess the credentials and the knowledge and the expertise that is consistent with the post.;D
We need to have an individual who has clear vision, innovative ideas and skill and administrative abilities.;N
I think that you will be a tremendous asset to the Commerce Department efforts in export promotion which is key to providing a strong competitive environment in which our businesses can thrive.;D
I believe small and large businesses must have the opportunities to export abroad to maintain a strong economy.;N
Others, particularly Senator Dorgan, have talked about being vigilant about unfair trade practices.;N
Certainly, it is a concern to have the estimated $440 billion trade deficit which we incurred last year.;N
This unprecedented deficit mentioned by Senator Dorgan underscores the Federal Trade Deficit Review Commission finding that long-term trade deficits are not sustainable or desirable for the long term.;N
And that is certainly something that we have to be mindful of with the passage and the ratification of the trade agreement with China.;N
We have to be vigilant in China's compliance and enforcement with WTO agreements without any question.;N
And I would encourage you, as I was discussing with you yesterday in our meeting, to seek and fill the position that was proposed by the Clinton Administration last year with respect to having a deputy secretary at the Commerce Department to monitor China's compliance with WTO agreements, especially for import-sensitive businesses like textiles and apparel that have been devastated in my State and the State of the Chairman of this Committee over the last decade.;N
I think it is all the more important that we have a responsibility--indeed an obligation--to strongly enforce the principles of these agreements to make sure that their end of the bargain is being upheld.;N
As Chair of the Ocean and Fisheries Subcommittee, I also would call your attention to our nation's fisheries.;N
I guess I do not have to remind you, given the coastal State that you come from, Mr. Evans, and our colleagues.;N
But our nation's fisheries are an invaluable resource, certainly to my State as well and to this country.;N
We have seen the value of those resources increase by more than 11 percent last year alone.;N
I would have to say my biggest concern is in holding regulatory agencies accountable for the regulatory decisions they make.;N
In this instance, as we prepare to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act which is the primary law governing our nation's fisheries, we have to make sure that we have the good science to back up those regulatory decisions.;N
I conducted six hearings across this country last year, and the major complaint that I heard from the wide range of stakeholders is that the agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, failed to provide the kind of science to back up and to reinforce the strong regulatory action that they were taking.;N
Also what is disturbing is the trend toward litigation driving the agency's decisions because of the lack of good science.;N
So this transition to sustainable fisheries has been a difficult one that has really culminated in a never-ending morass of regulations upon regulations.;N
To cite an example, the New England groundfishing industry--as Senator Kerry would also acknowledge--has faced more changes than one could count.;N
And I hope that with your background and experience that you would be able to lead that change in improving the management of that agency as well as the overall fishing industry.;D
That is a very important program to many areas of the country, including the State of Maine.;N
And I hope that you will continue to sustain that agency, to help revitalize areas of the country that have been bypassed in this unprecedented era of economic growth.;D
And finally, on the technology issue, I too want to underscore the importance of the Technology Opportunities Program that is within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, because it is important to revitalizing and rejuvenating areas of the country that have not experienced strong economic growth and who are apt to be left behind in this information revolution.;N
And I am certain that in your hands we will be able to succeed and thrive and flourish in Hawaii.;D
The Committee is pleased to have our distinguished colleagues Senator Gramm and Senator Hutchison to present the nominee.;N
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Commerce Committee, let me thank you for having this early hearing.;N
It is a great privilege for me to be here today to introduce my fellow Texan and my friend, Donald L. Evans and to introduce you to him as the President's nominee for Secretary of Commerce.;N
Don Evans has served as Chairman of the Board and CEO of a major oil and gas exploration company with a billion dollars of private assets.;D
Few candidates for Secretary of Commerce have ever brought the rich and lengthy experience in the private sector of the economy to this job that Don Evans brings.;D
I think as an indication of his ability as a manager, he became CEO of a billion dollar company when he was 33 years old.;D
He has served our State in many positions of leadership, certainly one of the most important is Chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas which is a huge concern, 80,000 staff members, $6 billion budget.;D
But he has served with great distinction as Chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas.;D
He was the driving force behind Native Vision, which is a program to assist Native American children.;D
And that program, which is largely his creation, now provides services to some 10,000 Native American children in America.;D
He is a graduate of the University of Texas in mechanical engineering which is one of their most outstanding programs at the university.;D
And I think the happy condition we are in today is finding ourselves where through our action in the Senate we can put Don Evans on America's side as Secretary of Commerce.;N
And I very strongly recommend to this distinguished Committee that Don Evans be reported favorably and confirmed by the Senate.;N
And I want to thank you and Senator McCain for working together to have this early hearing so that we can get an early confirmation.;N
And he said, ``Well, if you could remind me of every place I lived when I went to the University of Texas.'';N
I want to say that I am particularly pleased that our President-elect has chosen someone who is a true entrepreneur, someone who knows the ups and downs of business.;D
Because this is a man who knows first-hand what the businesses of our country go through when we have economic swings as we are seeing today.;D
But mostly he will understand what they are going through and how we can level out those peaks and valleys.;D
Second, from a non-credible source, an Aggie, no less, you have heard of his service to the University of Texas.;D
But in fact, I am also an alum of the University of Texas and very proud that he has held the very highest position of leadership in our mutual university and that he serves as Chairman of the Board of Regents.;D
Senator Rockefeller, you were talking about the importance of research and bringing fledgling researchers up through our system in America, that was one of the great strengths of Don Evans' service as Chairman of the University of Texas Board of Regents.;D
He focused on research and increased the opportunities for our young researchers at the University of Texas throughout the system because he too felt that that was so important.;D
So I have a feeling that research is going to be one of the important priorities that he will bring to the Commerce Department.;D
I do not need to go back through his resume because I think Senator Gramm has given you that.;N
But I will just say that I am very proud that this Texan has been chosen to lead the Department of Commerce.;D
And I do hope that our Committee will confirm him quickly so that he can represent the best that is America in our free enterprise system to the world.;N
When you talk about trade it cannot be a one-way street with the opportunity to export, but that is not our problem.;N
You remind me of that Small Business Administration questionnaire that went out some years ago, Mr. Evans.;N
I take almost everything I produce for General Electric in Greenville and the Dozer turbines down in Florence where we are making the magnetic resonance images.;N
What we really need is a change of mindset to get away from the foreign trade as foreign aid.;N
If we make a finding in favor, then we are going to run up the price of gasoline during an election year.'';N
So they bucked it up to the Court of International Trade on a technology issue about standing.;N
But I want to give you that as an example because the Zenith case, the entire Cabinet after a 3-year trial and a Supreme Court finding and everything else of that kind, with President Reagan, the Cabinet had voted to go ahead and enforce the finding.;N
So America's industry says ``the heck with these trade lawyers and spending 3 years and millions of dollars in court.;N
And so before you can produce the Boeing 777 or sell it in the People's Republic, they say you have got to produce half of it in downtown Shanghai.;N
You pick up Monday's Wall Street Journal and it says we are going to try to compete now with the 747 super-duper 747.;N
The Europeans do not have one, but the AirBus crowd is now trying to go to 600 passengers.;N
Not the crazies that came out of Oregon--excuse me, Ron--that tried to break up Main Street there in Seattle, you know, that crowd that came.;N
That is why we plead with you to please take over so that we have got a proper, not just--we do not need a sheriff or chief of police to enforce.;N
Everybody else uses their market to promote the interests of their manufacturer, and we have got to start doing the same.;N
Before you become a nation state, you have got to produce the steel for the weapons of war and the tools of industry.'';N
And then we come back to our workers and steel plants here and say, ``Oh, you have got to compete.;N
That is what you appeared before the group, International Trade Commission, and made an eloquent statement about that need.;N
With respect to fisheries that Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry pointed out, we actually had to hold up an almost continuing resolution and could not adjourn just before Christmas on account of a fisheries case--the sea lions up in Alaska.;N
And we had not gotten the right science to feed into the right court finding to protect those fisherman up there in Alaska.;N
So a little thing--all for the want of a horseshoe nail--a little thing in your department becomes an almost super important matter here on the Hill itself.;N
I note the presence of Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn from the State of Washington, who is here in support of our nominee and we thank you for being here, Congresswoman Dunn.;N
One of your responses to the pre-hearing questionnaire states that Tom Brown, Incorporated has been involved in various State and Federal administrative agency proceedings in the normal course of this business.;N
Could you clarify what proceedings Tom Brown, Incorporated was involved in and their disposition?;N
And did any of these proceedings involve damages or civil penalties paid to the government or to third parties and your involvement there.;N
There have been numerous reports in the past that the Department of Commerce trade missions have involved explicit and implicit fundraising activities or requests.;N
There have also been allegations that there may have existed a quid pro quo involving campaign contributions in return for being involved in or invited on such missions.;N
Without passing judgment on the veracity of these reports, I would like to know what actions you intend to take to ensure that such activity does not occur in the future.;N
Would you for the record submit to this Committee no later than 30 days from now in writing your plan to ensure that electoral politics do not play a role in the Department of Commerce programs and trade missions?;N
Well, I appreciate the priority that you are putting on it and particularly that you would work with all of the others involved to try to set a policy that everyone has a part in developing and then letting everyone know what that policy is.;D
The only other comment that I would make, and I think that you have seen the diversity of issues with which you are going to have to deal from the opening statements of Members.;N
I would just say that I think the President-elect's focus on an energy policy in the very near term is well placed.;D
And I hope that you as Secretary of Commerce and someone who understands this business will be helpful in formulating an energy policy that not only is good for the short-term and the help that is needed in the short-term to stabilize prices, but also for the long term.;D
We must have conservation and production in our own country if we are going to control the stability of our own oil resources.;N
So I hope that with the Secretary of Energy, with the Secretary of Interior and with the President-elect, you will be a part of a process that will give us an energy policy really for the first time in this country that will value all of those elements and put us on the right course for having better control of our own destiny as it relates to energy.;D
And with that, I will just say that you know I am going to support you and I am very pleased that you are here.;N
Among those were about an undercount of approximately 8.4 million Hispanics, Asians and blacks.;N
The sampling back then found that the decennial census undercounted Native Americans living on reservations at a rate of 15 times that of whites.;N
And it also undercounted Latinos and blacks at a rate of 6 to 7 times the rate of whites, and Asians at a rate of 3 times that of whites.;N
Now, the experts in the Census Bureau have determined that a statistical sampling process is a viable, scientifically sound method to ensure that those counts are accurate, and that that would provide us with a single uniform standard by which we can count accurately our fellow Americans.;N
I would like to know if the professionals in the Department were to recommend to you as Commerce Secretary--and we do not know this yet--but if they were to come to you and say, Mr. Secretary, there is a bad undercount here and we have determined based on this scientific methodology that we need to rectify that so that Americans are properly represented, your predecessor Mr. Mineta has, in fact, left in place a process that will allow them to do that.;N
Will you honor what Mr. Mineta has put in place and, in fact, follow the professional recommendation?;N
What I and others are concerned about is that it is left to professionals, that politics does not enter into it so that some recourse is sought that does not respect the rule that is in place.;N
I mean, is there any reason that you would see as you approach this job that would motivate you to suggest that you would not leave it to the Census Bureau?;N
Would you as a matter of your confirmation today guarantee to the Committee that if there were some reason that you thought that the rule Mr. Mineta put in place should not be honored that you would come back to the Committee and explain to the Committee in an open session precisely what the rationale for changing that might be?;N
Last year at the World Economic Forum, which is a gathering of significant business and corporate interests from around the globe, a poll was taken of the leading businesspeople there.;N
And overwhelmingly, these corporate chiefs from around the planet agreed that one of the most serious issues, the most serious issue, that they felt they faced in the long-term was the problem of global warming.;N
Paul O'Neil, who will be our new Treasury Secretary, has been a leader, in fact, among the corporate community in leading his company to proactively take steps to deal with this issue.;D
And NOAA is our most important research entity, most important entity for climate change knowledge, science.;N
And I wonder if you are familiar with the IPCC climate assessment and what your commitment would be with respect to that issue and the leadership role the Commerce Department plays in it?;N
On the census, Mr. Evans, it is the Committee's hope that you will support President-elect Bush's supporting sampling and opposing hand counts.;D
In your position you are going into, Mr. Evans, now, this morning we had the opportunity to visit with the appointee for the Secretary of Agriculture.;N
And food safety, of course, is always an issue with the Department of Agriculture and other departments.;N
You know, we have the most inefficient government in the world, but it is designed that way.;N
And with you coming in, what happens in the Department of Transportation and what happens in the Department of Energy and what happens in the Department of Agriculture effects a lot of things that happens in the Department of Commerce.;N
In other words, you have the ability to oversee or to look on what the policies of those agencies are, and how it effects our commerce, our movement of trade, our everyday life.;N
I do not know how you set it up, but I would certainly like to see some sort of a little office off in the corner that is in charge of communicating or nourishing a relationship between departments because of these very sensitive areas.;N
I think the same challenges in order to make government work, we have to nourish those relationships between communications of what we do over in the Department of Labor.;N
Now, what we do in the Department of Energy and Transportation does effect our ability to foster economic opportunities for every American in this country.;N
And you know that unlike any other steel industry in the world, not one single dime of Federal money has gone into the productivity increases, the remodeling, the complete--whether it is environmental, furnaces, whatever, it has all been money which has been borrowed or taken from profits and which can no longer be borrowed from banks.;N
I indicated to you in my opening statement that about half of our steel industry, if two more go under, which I think they are going to, about half will be in bankruptcy.;N
But when Bethlehem is trading at about $1 stock, one really has to stand back and say what is going on here?;N
Now, Italy produces steel--and substitute them for any other nation in the world--they have not made a profit in a generation or more.;N
Whatever the difference is at the end of the year, the government makes up that difference.;N
And hence, the whole concept of making sure that import surges and anti-dumping circumvention laws are enforced.;N
I mean, people say that if you say something like that, you are a protectionist or that you are doing something which is regressive.;N
If the United States were to make a decision, an inadvertent decision, by not making other decisions, to say, ``Oh, well, the Middle East has a lot of oil.;N
We import an enormous percentage of what we use in this country now because it is dumped at lower prices than the cost of production in the home country.;N
And as I indicated to you yesterday, Weirton Steel, which when we made it into an ESOP in 1982 had 13,000 people working for it.;N
If you want to ask Mr. Gore why he did not carry the State of West Virginia, a large part of it would come around to that and the effect on the coal industry which feeds the steel industry in West Virginia.;N
Now, I do not want to inject politics into that, but it is a very graphic example of how angry our people are at the Export/Import Bank loan and the way steel import surges and the steel prices was not dealt with by the present administration, the Clinton Administration.;N
I go back to what Vice Present-elect Cheney said, that we have to have a steel industry to have a defense industry.;N
You cannot go to war in the Gulf or any other place and say, ``Korea, could you lend us some steel so we can make some more whatever kind of armaments?'';N
One, that you would in a sense make a commitment that you recognize that in the promotion of American industry that that also involves the promotion of keeping, as Chairman Hollings has indicated, that manufacturing base of which there can be no more important component than steel.;N
Second, that you would agree with me that if this industry is, in fact, going to be saved, if we are not going to simply lose all of it, that the government--and this is always a difficult decision.;N
On the other hand, clearly it did not work with a Democratic government--has to somehow intervene to be helpful.;N
And I hope that you would say to me that you would be willing to consider and perhaps promote not just sort of a generalized intervention into this problem of your own intellect and energy, but also take a very clear look at the Section 201 approach which would do more to stop import surges than anything else I can think of.;N
One of the things about commerce in the couple of years I have been on the Commerce Committee and certainly the 4 years I have been in the Senate, that one has to realize as we move into the 21st century is the impact of e-commerce, the impact of technology on our society, the need for technological workers.;N
In my own interest, I mentioned the products from my State that we sought to export, that we seek to find markets for abroad.;N
In all honesty, I find it fascinating that our country, our economy, has to import a lot of technological workers from abroad to fill the 3- to 4-hundred-thousand high technology jobs out there that are going lacking for workers.;N
Which brings us to more maybe your role as Chairman of the Board of Regents of a great university system and that maybe the key to economic growth and commerce, particularly e-;N
commerce, is growing our own high tech workers and providing the kind of connectivity to the not only global marketplace, but through the Internet for all of our workers.;N
If President-elect Bush's goal is to leave no person behind, no community behind, is really to be fulfilled, which is our basic wish, it is obvious if you look at America, and certainly my State, there are lot of people that are not connected.;N
I held a forum in South Georgia, rural Georgia, on the whole point of high tech workers and whether or not rural America, rural Georgia, was connected, particularly via the Internet.;N
I found it interesting that in urban America, and even the urban poor, are more connected via the Internet than shall we say anyone, wealthy or poor, in rural America or in rural Georgia.;N
In the Commerce Department, there is something called the Technology Opportunities Program, TOP, the TOP program, which provides infrastructure and Internet access to disadvantaged communities.;N
Not particularly black, not particularly Hispanic, not particularly white or particularly wealthy or economically disadvantaged.;N
And the cost seems to be higher in rural America for that connectivity than if you were just living in say a suburban part--urban part of America.;N
Well, the point being this forum highlighted for me this little-known program that happens to be in your agency.;N
I would just like to know or to ask you to take a look at that as maybe an opportunity through that program to facilitate connectivity.;N
And through continued infrastructure and Internet access grants or help to disadvantaged communities through these TOP grants.;N
In other words, continue to boost the American economy or the chance to participate in the global marketplace.;N
As you well know, some rural or poor or disabled individual sitting at home can through the Internet market goods abroad and in effect have a job, have a sales effort and so forth.;N
Technology Opportunities Program which provides infrastructure and Internet access to the disadvantaged communities around our country.;N
And I will be looking at that as a way to hopefully expand economic development, e-commerce and access to the Internet from their point of view.;N
commerce and the global marketplace that there is more and more information to suggest that a certain portion of our culture, our economy, is being left behind.;N
And to the extent to which we could boost their chances for connectivity is the extent to which that rising tide could lift those boats too.;N
And I appreciate your insight too into how both the private sector and the academic sector, with maybe a little help from government as a catalyst, maybe can with all three partners in effect working together, a lot of good things can happen.;N
Well, I hope you will get us a proposal on this promptly, because both Senator McCain and Senator Hollings spent a lot of time in discussions at the end of last year.;N
We feel we are pretty close and have something that would be important for the entrepreneurs in the new economy that hold so much promise and at the same time would be fair to the mayors and the governors by saying if you have got a proposal, we will consider it.;N
Because in your emphasis in terms of free markets and free enterprise, the key, of course, to free enterprise is for citizens to have confidence that they are being treated fairly.;N
We feel that you obviously need to get the consent of the individual and they ought to have access to their records and provisions for security and enforcement.;N
And again, I know because this is all new to you, I would just like this morning to have you outline your general feelings about how you are going to approach this privacy issue.;N
Because I think Fritz Hollings and John McCain have done very good work on these new economy issues over the last year or so.;N
And with your leadership, we could on both of these issues--the Internet Tax Freedom bill and the privacy issue--we could get out of this Committee bipartisan legislation and put something on the President's desk that he would feel good about signing.;N
Their lead issue that they have right now is spectrum and availability of spectrum to go into the next generation of wireless services.;N
So that I guess all of us can mindlessly be connected all the time anywhere wherever we are.;N
That is going to be a major issue for you in the department is the allocation of spectrum for this next generation of wireless services.;N
I hope you will be open to providing the necessary spectrum so that that next level of connectivity over the Internet, wireless, video wireless, a whole series of innovations within that industry will move forward.;N
Because I think that issue is going to determine the future of that next generation of wireless services.;N
Because the decisions made today put in place what we can or cannot do for the next couple of decades, I think, in this whole industry.;N
It can add a level of comfort and communication to people that we have really only dreamed of in the past.;N
But we could also limit it such that we will not be able to do it if we do not do it right.;N
So I appreciate your interest and your thoughtfulness on it, because it is an issue that is out there.;N
And a lot of times we spend time looking back on industries that we want to try to change.;N
A second one that is somewhat similar is high speed Internet access, particularly in our less populated areas in the country.;N
We had a hearing in this Committee several months ago about access to high speed Internet, and found that in the suburban and urban areas, generally really in the suburban areas, there was as much as 70 percent penetration of high speed Internet access.;N
There are a series of bills that have been put forward, some subsidies, some deregulatory, some tax incentives, on trying to get more deployment of high speed Internet into less populated areas.;N
The approach I am supporting is a deregulatory approach toward it, but you would add some real focus and effort and intensity to this so the problem does not continue to grow and exacerbate and cause difficulty for economic activity and other type of activities in rural areas.;N
The Members to be appointed next week have yet had an opportunity to confer or ask questions.;N
Whether or not that will require a further hearing, it will be up to our regular Chairman.;N
It is the Committee's hope that we can confirm you that first week after the inauguration.;N
I look forward to the continued close working relationship between our staffs, and I thank you again for holding this hearing on a very important position.;N
This Committee takes its advice and consent role very seriously, and I will note that Mr. Kassinger has responded in detail to the Committee's request for biographical and financial data.;N
I have had the opportunity to review your responses to the Committee's questionnaire and I look forward to moving your nomination quickly along with the other nominations we have considered before the Committee yesterday.;N
Prior to Mr. Kassinger's appointment, he was a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, where he had practiced since 1985.;D
From 1981 through 1985 Mr. Kassinger served as International Trade Counsel to the Senate Committee on Finance under the leadership of Chairmen Bob Dole and Bob Packwood.;D
Previously Mr. Kassinger served as an attorney with the U.S. Department of State from 1980 to 1981 and the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1978 to 1980.;D
Mr. Kassinger is currently serving the Department of Commerce as Senior Adviser to the Secretary.;D
I appreciate your willingness to serve, and if you have any family members here, please feel free to introduce them before you begin your remarks.;N
I know this is a very proud moment for all of you, especially your daughters, and we want to welcome them.;N
I just want to say a few quick words regarding today's nomination of Mr. Kassinger and later the testimony of Dr. Michael Adams, the distinguished President of the University of Georgia.;N
Mr. Kassinger has a distinguished record of public service, as an appointee in the Reagan Administration as well as his many years as a high-level staffer to Senator Bob Dole.;D
Mr. Kassinger is a proud recipient of both his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Georgia.;D
I understand that his father was Director of Public Safety in Athens, Georgia, some years ago, and I have every reason to believe he will continue his fine career in public service in his new capacity, and you certainly have my support.;D
As General Counsel for the Department of Commerce, the nominee will be the Chief Legal Officer of the agency and will oversee a variety of counsels ranging from the Patent and Trade Office to the Export-Import Offices.;N
I think a little later, Mr. Chairman, the Committee with hear Dr. Michael Adams, the President of the University of Georgia.;N
Dr. Adams is here to present his views in the current situation regarding college sport gambling.;N
We are aware of the controversy surrounding the issue and I look forward to his testimony.;N
Dr. Adams is no stranger to the Senate, having served Senator--Majority Leader, Howard Baker, for 6 years, 3 of which he was his Chief of Staff.;N
He has helped to make the University of Georgia one of the finest public universities in the country, and is quickly becoming a leading national figure in all issues affecting our education.;D
Mr. Chairman unfortunately, due to the previously scheduled hearings, I won't be able to stay for today's hearing, but I look forward to the testimony of witnesses.;N
I look forward to moving your nomination as quickly as possible so that you can get to work as quickly as possible.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you especially for having this hearing for these important nominees.;N
It is my special pleasure to introduce to our committee Nancy Victory as the President's nominee for the post of Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information in the U.S. Department of Commerce.;N
Not only is Nancy a tremendously qualified to lead this important office within the Department of Commerce.;D
I note here it says maybe she puts in that many hours at Wiley, Rein & Fielding, and she is a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and has been for 7 years, and we are very proud to have her as a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia.;D
She taught at Georgetown or went to law school at Georgetown University, graduated cum laude.;D
She has experience and knowledge garnered in the private sector dealing with a great number of technology issues which I think makes her an ideal choice to be the President's principal voice on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology issues.;D
Yesterday, we had a hearing, very important hearing, on the issue of trying to find additional spectrum for the ever-;N
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, which Nancy will head, is an essential player in meeting these very truly important missions since the agency is responsible for managing the Federal Government's use of the radio frequency spectrum.;N
The efforts of NTIA, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Defense, and all the private sector interests, as we witnessed yesterday will significantly impact short-term and long-term policies related to truly one of America's most vital economic and national security interests.;N
Nancy Victory is uniquely qualified to serve as the Assistant Secretary of NTIA, given her 12 years plus of experience covering spectrum issues in particular.;D
As a partner with the law firm of Wiley, Rein & Fielding, Ms. Victory gained a great deal of expertise in wireless and satellite issues, including spectrum allocation, licensing, and compliance.;D
And I have met Nancy on several occasions over the years, and I feel very strongly that with her experience and her knowledge, I am convinced she will be a tremendous asset to our country's technological advancements.;D
I know she will bring all those years of experience and hard work on the very difficult and relevant telecommunications issues that we face today in her role as Assistant Secretary.;D
I also can say with great confidence that she is a woman of outstanding character and I have no doubt she will serve our country with integrity and will certainly meet the needs of all Americans, consumers, as well as our telecommunications enterprises alike.;D
So in closing, I hope the Committee will move quickly on her nomination so she can get to work on these important issues for the competitive advantage of our country in the years to come.;D
Welcome, and I have been most interested in filling that position at the Commerce Department for quite a while.;N
NTIA, I believe, is one of the most important seats there is down there, and to have someone of your capability, your leadership is really good.;D
Yesterday we had our first hearing on spectrum and spectrum reform and, of course, with the 3G, third generation wireless upon us now, your position becomes very, very important, so we are looking forward to working with you as we wander down that path to spectrum reform and management reform.;N
I am going to ask consent to include a statement in the record from Senator Helms in addition to the statement made by the Congresswoman a few minutes ago in support of the nomination of Dr. Jeffrey Runge.;N
You actually answered some of the questions, or addressed some of the questions I was going to ask you questions about.;N
But on the broadband deployment, I know the concern of the two Senators here, Chairman Dorgan and Senator Burns, as far as getting broadband, especially to rural areas.;N
As my good friend, Senator Burns will say, there is a lot of dirt to dig if you are using fiber-optics as a way of doing it.;N
sponsor of Senator Rockefeller's bill, S. 88, which is a broadband tax credit for deployment.;N
What would your view be of making it more, let us say technology neutral, in that the incentives are there as well for wireless, which may be a more practical way of getting broadband capabilities to rural areas and mountain hollers and so forth?;N
I do suspect that fiber will be important, and wireless will be, as well as satellite, in that mix.;N
However, there is a great deal of concern about the timing of this, when it should go forward, and obviously in some regards, depending upon which part of the spectrum is allocated, national security matters as well.;N
At this point, would you be willing to identify the most promising chunks of the 1755 to 1850 megahertz spectrum that could be available in the short term for commercial 3G use?;N
Now, in the short term, there is going to be an auction, or there may be an auction on the 1710 to 1755 megahertz chunk of the spectrum to release that.;N
There was discussion about waiting on that with concerns that many in the commercial industry are not ready to utilize it, but others will say gosh, we have to get involved in it, otherwise we will be left out whenever that arises.;N
What is your, if you do have a view, or if the Administration has a view, on the timing of that auction?;N
That is going to be probably one of the first decisions working with Dr. Powell, but you'll all have to determine, I believe, on that issue.;N
It is pretty obvious from yesterday when we had the hearing on spectrum that we are not using the spectrum that we have allocated now that is already in use efficiently.;N
In other words, there are new technologies that would allow us to do a lot more with the spectrum that has already been allocated.;N
Well, it will always be obvious that the industry will always say we need more spectrum, we need more spectrum.;N
Whenever we start down this road of trying to pass any kind of legislation that deals with management of that spectrum, if you think there was a lot of moving parts in the 1996 Act, you wait until we start down this road of performing this.;N
And I would suggest that, I think the role that you will play as the liaison between Congress and the Administration, or putting forth the Administration's approach to how they would like to see their policies with regard to telecommunications.;D
The FCC, you have two different roles, I think, and now we have heard suggestions that we should, some of the functions, they should be put together and function together--NTIA and FCC.;N
I think your function is primarily in the area of policy and how the Administration views telecommunications and where you want it to go.;N
It was fairly obvious yesterday that if we do not allocate more spectrum, then the technologies to use the present spectrum--in other words, putting a lot more in a bushel basket than just a bushel--that those technologies will continue to be developed.;N
Now I am just going to ask you, what do you think the wireless industry will look like in 5 years, in 10 years from now?;N
What kind of a vision do you see the role that it plays and can you, not right now, but I would say our next visit, advise us on how we can get there?;N
Dr. Runge, I think you are taking over a very important post, and I appreciate you coming by the office and visiting.;N
I just want to tell you that we have all had our experiences in an emergency room, and so I am very aware of your work, and the importance of your work, and also the importance of your vision of what you are taking on here.;D
Mr. Wolff and Mr. Hammerschmidt, of course, I know Mr. Hammerschmidt's father, too, and so we welcome you all to public service.;D
We are very fortunate in this country to have people who are willing to go through and jump through all of these hoops, fill out all this damnable paperwork.;N
And I just head back for the hills and this is the last time you would ever see this old cowboy.;N
But nonetheless, it proves to me that there are people who sincerely want to serve this country.;N
And have an idea, and a vision of where we want to go, and I applaud you for that because it is a work--it is a labor of love.;N
Dr. Runge, as you know, as part of the TREAD Act, NHTSA was given some very substantial tasks, and I think there are upwards of a dozen rulemaking processes going on.;N
I think the tire pressure rulemaking was just released, but tire standards, rollovers and others.;N
If you need more resources, are you committed to moving forward on all these fronts, and if you need more resources, will you come to us for more resources?;N
Let me ask you, why are you unable, in your judgment, to get broadband or DSL broadband service in your home?;N
Because the provider that normally would do that has simply decided they are not going to do it.;N
If the Senator would yield, I just got this last week, got a little flyer and I have been poking around and looking for it.;N
There is some wireless services that are coming in now, are being deployed, and we are going to look into those situations, but there is some competition coming, and now, when it wakes up the local loop guy, I do not know.;N
The reason I asked the question is because you and Ms. Victory and I and virtually everyone else are subject to the whims of an incumbent carrier who decides whether they will or will not build out DSL.;N
There are many areas of this country where you ought to have DSL service, they say we are not going to do that.;N
And the bull's eye of public policy in my judgment for you in a wide range of areas is to make sure we have communications capability in this country that are universal, and that includes not just a telephone, but it includes advanced services which we wrote in the 1996 Act.;N
The only way that is going to happen is if it is supported by the universal service fund if the FCC is capped contrary to the law we wrote, Senator Burns and I, and others actually helped write those provisions.;N
My hope is that every day when you go to work you understand that I couldn't get DSL at my home and I am a little upset by that and I am going to change public policy that provides robust competition, but provides stimulus to those incumbent carriers so we get rid of this digital divide.;N
You want to respond to that, colleagues, I think the President has chosen well, and I would echo the comments by Senator Burns.;N
It is important to ask men and women to present themselves for public service to serve our country and you and your families I hope are proud of your willingness to do that.;N
Today the Committee will hold a hearing on the nominations of Chief R. David Paulison to be U.S. Fire Administrator and Dr. Arden Bement to be Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.;N
Each of these individuals, I believe, will be confirmed, because they are very qualified and are going to play a critical role in our war against terrorism.;D
Obviously, science is getting increasingly important as it relates to America's national security.;N
Since the attacks on September 11th and the anthrax scares of the past several weeks, it is clear that our science and technology can, in fact, be used against us.;N
During the first days of the crisis, some news organizations were reporting that anthrax from American labs was actually sent to Iraq in the 1980's as part of a scientific effort.;N
Although the report did not mention government involvement in such an effort, the inherent risks are unmistakable.;N
It is our view that intellectual security needs to be part of any national security approach and, given the possibilities of the misuse of science, there is tremendous potential in harnessing science and technology in an affirmative and protective way.;N
That can include everything from developing the technology to safely land airplanes from a control tower instead of a cockpit to using science to quickly create antidotes and vaccines to potential bioterrorism agents.;N
Clearly, taxpayer funds, smartly invested in scientific advances, ultimately reward and benefit the safety and peace of mind of all citizens.;N
This Committee is acutely aware that information technology and scientific information such as that developed at NIST is critical to combatting terrorism.;N
I think it is also worth noting that, no matter how good your technology and science are, it always comes down to people.;N
That is why it is so important that we work closely with our nominees and evaluate their qualifications today.;N
The people on the front lines responding to domestic incidents from biological to conventional attacks will be our nation's firefighters, and we look forward to having you represent them, Chief Paulison.;N
The Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space has recently held a hearing on the needs of the Fire Service in responding to terrorism.;N
This country has more than a million firefighters, and the federal government must be a better partner in working to ensure that these dedicated and courageous Americans have the tools to do their jobs.;N
Towards that end, several weeks ago I called Mitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to ask that he make supplemental funding available immediately from the grants that are available under the Firefighter Investment and Response statute so that local fire departments can get the needed training and equipment that is so essential.;N
Chief Paulison has been tapped to lead FEMA's U.S. Fire Administration and be the firefighters' voice within the federal government.;D
Chief, we know you brought several members of your family with you today, and we would very much like you to introduce them and have them stand at this time.;N
Also our good fortune to have Dr. Bement here, who has been nominated to direct NIST, and we will consider his nomination as we consider Chief Paulison's.;N
The Fire Administration and NIST have a long history of working together on building and fire research.;N
At the urging of New York's Fire Department leaders who testified at our hearing on the needs of the Fire Service, I have written to Secretary of Commerce Don Evans to ask that NIST begin to look at developing standards for firefighting equipment.;N
One of the concerns that the Subcommittee has heard is that as equipment becomes more technologically sophisticated small departments have only the claims of the manufacturer to use in evaluating essential products.;N
Currently NIST's Office of Law Enforcement Standards has measures for low enforcement equipment such as bulletproof vests.;N
The Subcommittee is interested in working with the agency to see that effort expanded to include firefighters' equipment as well.;N
We want to congratulate the scientists both at NIST and NIST-supported scientists who shared in the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2001, and we are going to be discussing with Dr. Bement some of the priorities that he will have at the agency.;N
With that, I really would like to recognize my colleagues because I know their schedule is very tight.;N
But Dr. Bement, before we do that I understand you have some family here as well, and we would like you to have a chance to introduce them.;N
We are glad you are out in force, and we will have some more to say about your distinguished background, Dr. Bement.;D
I enjoyed our visit yesterday, as chaotic as it was, given the fact that we were standing up in the Capitol basement looking for space.;N
He has been a great addition to this Subcommittee and brings to this Committee expertise in areas such as space and insurance and a whole host of areas.;D
I had the good fortune, Mr. Chairman, of being Chairman of a subcommittee of which Ms. Morella was a part, and she was an outstanding member.;D
A lot of her interest in science and technology goes back to those days when we were first put on that Committee in the House.;D
He is a friend whose services are going to be enjoyed in the federal government, particularly in something that, as we approach the threat of terrorism, we cannot afford to have less than the best.;D
I had the opportunity to observe him from my capacity as the State Fire Marshal for Florida.;N
That is a job that a lot of the officials in the past never have paid much attention to, because the job is a lot more than that.;N
As you can imagine, in that capacity I got to work with David in his current position as the Chief of the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Department.;D
In 30 years of his dedicated public service, he rose from the rank of a rescue firefighter to fire chief.;D
He oversees 1900 personnel, a $200 million operating budget, and a $70 million capital budget.;D
His distinguished service on behalf of Miami-Dade County and the state of Florida has caused his expertise to be sought out around the country and now by our federal government.;D
He is Past President of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and he is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the American Red Cross.;D
So now, as the head of the U.S. Fire Administration, he is going to serve us in an additional capacity.;D
I think it is important for Members of Congress to do that when they know and can testify as to the character and expertise of an individual.;D
I also want to be joined by my colleague Bob Graham, who is in an Intelligence Committee meeting right now and who has submitted a letter endorsing Chief Paulison.;N
I am going to leave, with your permission, so that I can tend to some other things having to do with all kinds of nasty guys trying to do bad things and us trying to prevent them.;N
We appreciate your coming and, in spite of your desire to be called ``Marshal,'' I am glad they call you ``Senator.'';N
I can assure you it is a great privilege, and one of the great privileges is having the opportunity to work with folks like you.;N
Suffice it to say, having had a chance to work with you, Connie, during my career in the House, it is just great to have you.;N
You are constantly on the side of trying to practice good government out there and bring people together.;D
We really appreciate your coming, and we will make your prepared remarks part of the record in full, and you may proceed in any way that you feel comfortable.;N
But I am just very honored to speak in support of this wonderful nominee and this great, great nomination for the country.;N
As you know, I have watched you work on NIST issues over the years and you are really one of the people we look to for guidance on these issues.;D
In fact, first we'll have your presentation, then we will hear from Mr. Paulison, and finally I will have questions for each of you.;N
We will make your prepared remarks a part of the record in full, and if you would like to just highlight some of your major concerns that would be helpful.;N
We had our hearing for Dr. John Marburger, as you know, who will be heading up Science and Technology, and we discussed the need for a coordinated effort among the federal science agencies in conducting research to combat terrorism.;N
We were concerned about the General Accounting Office report that showed that often the left hand does not talk to the right hand.;N
They said, for example, that the Coast Guard and the Defense Department were doing the same research on chemical weapons detection for cruise ships.;N
So you end up taking dollars away from critically needed functions because of duplication, and you do not have the benefits of the sharing of information.;N
Why do we not start by having you describe how you see NIST being a part of this fight against terrorism.;N
You have obvious areas with respect to technical competencies, such as quantum computing, encryption, sensing tiny amounts of substances.;D
On the question of fire research, as I mentioned, we looked at fire services issues in some depth not long ago.;N
We heard at our hearing testimony from a number of witnesses, including the New York Fire Department, in which they described the need for the development of performance standards for firefighter equipment.;N
They said at this point there are not any standards by which they can credibly evaluate the new equipment, particularly the equipment containing advanced technologies.;N
After we heard that testimony, I wrote Secretary Evans asking that NIST look into this issue and set up a program to deal with it specifically, such as the one that now exists at NIST for law enforcement services and equipment.;N
Could you state for the record whether you are willing to put together a program that addresses the concerns raised by the firefighters at the Subcommittee's recent hearing?;N
Tell me then, because that is very helpful and very constructive, to have your position with respect to putting together a program on the standards for the equipment, what other areas of research do you think are promising as it relates to NIST in terms of getting the next generation of advanced firefighting technology out to the firefighters?;N
My understanding is you have got one-quarter of your people, something like upwards of 800 people, eligible for retirement this year.;N
Suffice it to say, again and again we are getting these reports about the great need for talented, dedicated people in federal service.;N
GAO has cited the human capital challenges as a top concern affecting many federal managers.;N
How do you plan to address this issue so that NIST has an adequate supply of young researchers ready to step in?;N
I would like to know if you plan to expand your postdoctoral program or other kinds of approaches so that we can attract more young researchers.;N
In terms of your resources, I would like to know whether you think you have got enough resources and facilities to continue the kind of work that has produced the Nobel Prizes, the repeated instances where you have won, and whether you have the resources to deal with the relationship with the Technology Administration, which as you know has always been unique and a big disparity between NIST and the Technology Administration.;N
Why do you not talk for a moment so we have it on the record how you are going to approach this question of the adequacy of resources.;N
As you know, Bayh-Dole and Stevenson-Weidler are essentially the two statutes that govern cooperative research and the licensing of federal inventions.;N
I am of the view that, at this point, the statute does not work anywhere near as well as it could for all of the stakeholders, businesses, universities and taxpayers.;N
I am interested particularly in the involvement with the laboratories as it relates to universities and businesses.;N
They are constantly talking to me about delays and the amount of paperwork that they have to slog through to be part of the statute.;N
When you look at the numbers in terms of return on investment research, they look pretty paltry.;N
I have, as I indicated to you yesterday, made it clear that I want to see the Administration look again at this statute and look at ways, working with all of the stakeholders, that it can be improved.;N
I would like to have you tell me how you see the tech transfer system working at NIST, given the fact that your operation, as we talked about yesterday, is one piece of the puzzle.;N
I think we can streamline the red tape and the bureaucracy that has been frustrating for businesses and universities, and I think we can shore up the return on investment for taxpayers.;N
Secretary Bond is a good man, and I appreciate your taking it up with him and with Floyd Kvamme, if you will do that and get back to us.;D
In fact, I would like you, if you would, could you get back to us within 90 days after you are confirmed and give us your sense of how NIST, to the extent you can, and the Administration is willing the proceed as we look to try and strengthen?;N
I am always anxious to avoid getting entangled in legislative rewrites of complicated statutes.;N
But, I would like to see us take this out through the prism of each of the stakeholders--universities, businesses, laboratories, and taxpayers.;N
We are going to get you confirmed quickly so you can go to work on these and other pressing matters.;N
Well, thank you and I think you are going to be spared a little bit now while we will go to Mr. Paulison.;N
I think, given the fact that you are there in Miami-Dade, you have seen first-hand what local fire departments are up against.;N
Tell us what you think the biggest needs are and what your priorities would be at the U.S. Fire Administration to address, the big priorities?;N
We are going to have a specific Subcommittee hearing to look at some of the technology aspects of what happened on September 11th.;N
You may have heard that I have actually suggested that we look at something along the lines of a technology equivalent of the national Guard, a kind of effort to mobilize people in the private sector so that we have got the equipment and the brains and the talent, essentially, ready to go.;N
Tell me, if you would--and sort of step back from what you said earlier--what the problems were in terms of interoperability when people tried to be in contact with each other in that situation and what you think we might do to deal with it?;N
Now, I gather that you tried to do some of these things in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.;N
I read the article that you wrote in ``Fire Chief'' magazine, and it talks about your prepositioning platform aerials around your county and generators and portable repeaters, in effect, a backup kind of communications system.;N
Do you think it would be helpful to have people from the private sector in the communications and technology sector in position to try to assist you, a sort of talent pool that you could call on to re-establish normal communications?;N
We will be looking to work with you as we go forward with the hearings in an effort to develop an initiative.;N
You are a local fire chief, so you can tell us a bit about what it is like to go through the bureaucracy and the red tape and what you can do to improve the process there, and then I am sure you have had some thoughts already about what you will do after confirmation.;N
What could be done that would really be helpful to a local fire chief, since you hale from those ranks, and then what seems doable to you in terms of the Washington, DC., situation?;N
Now, as you know there is a lot of discussion in the Congress about hiring a substantial number of new firefighters, a discussion of perhaps 70,000 new firefighters.;N
We would like to know if you think a program like this is needed, do you have the resources to administer it, and what you think of the suggestion that the Department of Labor would run it?;N
The only other question I have for you, Mr. Paulison, deals with preparedness coordination.;N
As you know, the General Accounting Office has been making recommendations for several years now to reduce duplication and improve coordination of the assistance programs to the first responders.;N
They cite in their most recent report that there is still some confusion about these various kinds of programs.;N
What in your view could be done to respond to what the GAO has been talking about with respect to confusion among federal assistance programs?;N
As you can tell, it is particularly hectic right now with so many colleagues being pulled to other meetings.;N
Chairman Hollings is, as well, given the fact that we are already asking you for projects and to do things about standards for firefighter equipment and get into whole areas you never thought you would even be asked about, like Bayh-Dole, Dr. Bement.;N
We have got to get you all credentialed and approved, and I am confident that the Senate is going to do that.;N
On behalf of the Committee, we are very pleased that two distinguished individuals such as yourselves are interested and willing to serve our country right now.;N
They have been very cooperative, starting with Secretary Evans and the other individuals that you have talked about today, and I think that is a very appropriate one to quit on because that is what it is going to take, that kind of bipartisan effort maximize the success of our policies in an area that obviously is in the forefront of the public's attention.;N
We are very proud of what all of those in your profession have done to help our country when very often it is not at all expected and do it extraordinarily well.;N
Senator Hutchison from Texas was going to be here, Captain, to present you, but was unavoidably not able to do it, with the aviation security conference going on, which is why a number of our Members happen to be absent, because we are trying to get that important legislation out before we leave for the recess.;N
This morning we are here to consider the nominee for Maritime Administrator, Captain William Schubert.;N
I appreciate very much that the Administration has nominated an individual who has actual experience in this particular area dealing with the merchant marine.;D
Captain Schubert has previously worked at the Maritime Administration and brings a great deal of knowledge and experience in that very important field.;D
You helped facilitate the sealift operation during the Persian Gulf effort, which was very difficult, indeed.;D
I think it is important that we get you in place as soon as possible and hope we can take this to the floor this week.;N
1969 graduate of King's Point Merchant Marine Academy and we will not hold it against you, but your brother-in-law is one of our former colleagues, Senator Bill Brock.;D
My home state of Louisiana obviously is one that is very concerned about the merchant marine, the maritime, and what we do at the Maritime Administration.;N
We are obviously very heavily dependent on maritime industry and maritime transportation in general.;N
Louisiana is the bottom of the funnel through which two-thirds of this nation drains all of their waterways and obviously that creates some problems, but it also creates enormous economic benefits for the state and also for the nation.;N
We live near and are on the waterways and the Gulf of Mexico, so we certainly in our areas understand the importance of ports, understand the importance of a strong maritime industry, and know quite well in my state, and I would hope the rest of the Congress feels the same, that this is something the government needs to be involved in.;N
We cannot just say to the U.S. maritime industry good luck, pat you on the back, and hope you are successful, because, in fact, our industry has to compete not just with fellow American companies, but we have to compete throughout the world.;N
Many times we find our industries having to compete, not with other companies alone, but other companies who work with their governments very closely and in many cases are partially owned by their governments.;N
So it is a very unlevel competitive field that our industry must face as we ply the oceans of the world.;N
I think that there are many of us that recognize that, while we are free enterprise supporters, that we have to recognize that you have to deal with the hand that you have been dealt, and until all the world operates as we do that there is a very legitimate role for the U.S. government in helping to guarantee that we remain strong as a maritime nation.;N
The Congress does not have a 100 percent view of the importance of some of the things the Maritime Administration does.;N
In fact, some of the folks in the Administration do not like some of the programs that you administer.;N
Title 11 obviously is one of these, where they recommended, as I remember, zero funding for the Title 11 program, which is a program where we have had the ability to aid our U.S. industries, not through giving them money or giving them grants or giving them construction subsidies, but rather giving them loan guarantees whereby they can go to the private markets and borrow money to build ships in U.S. yards that will have U.S. sailors on board, and that that loan has to be repaid by the private company and only if they default would the government have to participate in picking up a portion of that loan, and it is only a portion of the loan.;N
We regularly fund the differential or the risk factor in getting a loan that is guaranteed by the government.;N
That is a program that has worked very well and it has worked very well for a very long time.;N
It has particular challenges now because of the economy and particularly in some of the civilian cruise ships that we are watching very closely.;N
This is going to be on your watch, and it is going to be tough, because you are going to be in the middle.;N
You work for the Administration, but you also have to follow the laws of the Congress, and the Congress has said very strongly that the Title 11 program is one that we support, this Committee supports, this Congress supports, and it is the law of the land.;N
You have somebody downtown on Pennsylvania Avenue looking over your shoulder and you are going to have Congress looking over your shoulder, and you have to carry forward.;N
You are not going to come up here and say, I do not know anything about ships, I am not for an American fleet, and I am not for an American flag, I am not for American seamen.;N
But we want to make sure, and I think you are that type of person, that it is more than words.;D
It has got to be a real commitment, that you know this is an opportunity for you, it is an opportunity for this country, because you have a great challenge and every challenge presents great opportunities if we accept them.;N
Norm Mineta, the Secretary, a good friend of mine, former colleague of mine, he was happy when I left the House because it moved him up one seat and he became Chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee.;N
He was one of my most enthusiastic backers to run for the Senate, so he could become Chairman of the Public Works Committee in the House, and now he is Secretary of the Department.;D
But he has got a lot of other things on his plate, and there has got to be a voice that nags at him constantly.;N
You have got to be the nagger for the oceans, the nagger for the maritime industry, and the nagger for the programs, because nobody else is going to be the advocate over there.;N
The maritime transportation system, the Department of Transportation did a recent report that talked about the fantastic growth in the maritime trade worldwide, but at the same time they spoke of the rapid decrease in capacity that we have.;N
So on the one hand the maritime trade worldwide is really increasing, but the U.S.'s ability to participate in that is decreasing in the sense that we are rapidly running out of ships, they are becoming older, more aged, and being retired.;N
Do we just say, all right, we will have all the trade in the world, we will ship everything, but we will just ship it on tankers from Third World countries under flags of convenience?;N
"Suppose the Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels calls you up and says: Bill, come down; I want to talk to you about Title 11; I want you to go down to the White House and sit with the President and tell him what you think about it; I have recommended that it be zero-funded.";N
"You go in the Oval Office and President Bush says: Captain, I am trying to get rid of this maritime program called Title 11; what should I do?";N
That is why I phrased the question, if the President calls you in and says, Captain, what do you think about this program.;N
My question to you is if the President says, Captain, what do you think about the Title 11 program, am I right or am I wrong?;N
If he only listens to people that are landlubbers, they are going to say zero it out, it is not needed.;N
If they say eliminate it and that is my final decision, you have to carry out those recommendations.;N
But in reaching those recommendations and deciding on those positions, if they call you and ask you what do you think, I would hope that the person in charge of the Maritime Administration would be in a position to advocate a program that I think Congress has always said is important and has been successful.;N
Because let me tell you, if you do not advocate it there ain't going to be nobody else down there.;N
For the maritime, we do not have anybody else that is higher up dealing with ships and the maritime industry than you are going to be.;N
So we have to depend on you for making arguments as to why we should have programs that help these areas, because if you do not there is not going to be anybody else there that will.;N
I accept that and want to give you all the help you can and give you all the support you can in making those arguments.;N
But a lot of times you are going to be the only one in the room that is going to have the opportunity to speak aggressively for this industry and we are counting on you to do that.;N
If you look at the programs that are trust fund programs that we have, we have a trust fund for the highway program.;N
You pay your gas tax, 100 percent of it goes into the trust fund and it is used for things that are important to people who pay the tax.;N
"You have got an aviation trust fund, dollar in, dollar out; highway trust fund, dollar in, dollar out.";N
But the maritime industry, according to some of the earlier figures that I have seen, is contributing through taxes about $22 billion annually, $22 billion, and we are getting back about $5 billion.;N
So if you look at what we are doing with things that fly, things that are on roads, they get back what they put in.;N
But this industry is significantly different in that people who ship things, who pay fees and taxes, fuel taxes and taxes for the intercoastal waterways, inland waterways, the customs duties--and what else?;N
If you add up all these various taxes that are paid for the maritime industry, we are not getting back anywhere anything that compares with what these other areas are getting.;N
But when you kick in $22 billion and you only get back $5 billion, something is wrong, because in aviation it is not like that, in highways and roads it is not like that.;N
We are going to raise it and I really would like to work cooperatively with the Administration to see whether we cannot get a more reflective and balanced system for money contributed from this industry and getting it back, in terms of whether it is seaport security or whether it is in terms of port development or whether it is in terms of U.S. maritime fleet expansion.;N
You know, I think a lot of people think that, well, all these tonnage taxes and all these other things are coming right back to the industry, and it is really not.;N
I think that you uniquely bring some qualifications to this job that are in keeping with what this Committee and this Congress wants to see in a Maritime Administration.;D
My daughter works with a law firm in New Orleans and called me yesterday, because I am in the Hart Building--well, I am not really in the Hart Building.;N
I am supposed to be in the Hart Building, but the Hart Building is closed, so we have not been getting all of the mail.;N
One of the clients in their law firm has written a very strong letter of support to me on your behalf, asking that I support you for Maritime Administrator.;N
Since we had not responded because we had not gotten the letter, they got my daughter to call me and to say----;N
I thought she was calling asking for money, but she was calling to ask me to support your nomination.;N
I said, ``Well, call the people back and tell them not only am I supporting it, I am chairing the confirmation hearing, so you are in really good shape''.;N
With that, we hope that this Committee will--I would imagine we will try and have something off the floor whereby we will report this nomination and get it to the floor so you can get to work, Captain, and good sailing.;N
It seems to change every few minutes, and my apologies to you for the delay and any inconvenience.;N
We are pleased today to consider the nomination of Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher as the eighth Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.;N
We would also like to thank him for his ongoing cooperation and we are glad to have him here.;N
NOAA was created on October 3rd, 1970, due in large part to the work of our distinguished Chairman, Senator Hollings.;N
Congress created NOAA in order to provide ``better protection of life and property from natural hazards, for better understanding of the total environment, and for exploration and development leading to intelligent use of our natural resources.'';N
All the Members of this Committee recognize the need to have an agency whose mission is to describe and predict changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and wisely manage the nation's coastal and marine resources.;N
The recently established Commission on Public Policy is going to take a new look at these issues, which ought to raise the profile of NOAA issues nationally and certainly here in Washington, DC.;N
With an annual appropriation of over $3 billion and over 11,000 employees located in every state, NOAA represents over 60 percent of the Department of Commerce's budget and nearly 30 percent of the total Department of Commerce workforce.;N
The agency faces a number of challenges over the next decade, including management of the coastal zone, protecting and managing fish stocks and marine mammals, providing critical information on climate change, and continuing to protect the public and facilitate commerce by issuing state-of-the-art forecasts and warnings.;N
One-half of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of the coast and if population trends continue as expected, pressure on conflicting demands for ocean coastal resources are likely to increase, as will vulnerability to coastal hazards.;N
States and coastal communities certainly need an activist federal government to improve coordination, strengthen partnerships, and provide the necessary resources.;N
Given our nominee's experience both in and out of the federal government, he clearly is in a position to assist the NOAA team.;D
We believe your practical management experience will also serve you well in efforts to improve NOAA management of marine fisheries and devise innovative solutions.;D
As I think our nominee knows, our West Coast groundfish fishery and the communities that depend on it are clearly in desperate shape.;N
Over the past decade, the West Coast groundfish fishery has experienced a population decline for several of the species that comprise the fishery, forcing the managers to impose even more strict regulations and leading to a great deal of economic dislocation.;N
I am particularly concerned that the management of the Northwest Region has ignored a number of these looming problems.;N
I will say that the NOAA Fisheries Director Bill Hogarth is now working to improve this situation, and clearly there is much to do.;N
I want the nominee to know that I look forward to working with him and Dr. Hogarth on these issues.;N
The challenge is to get the right number of fishers out there at the right time, catching the right number of fish, in order to make this industry sustainable.;N
The average fisherman in Oregon has now lost 40 percent of his income and in some cases regulations have cut the total allowable catch by 90 percent.;N
There has been no long-term help for the fisher who wants out of this regulatory nightmare.;N
For the past few years, Congress has provided economic assistance to help these folks get by and that is to a great extent through the help of Chairman Hollings and Senator Stevens, and we are very appreciative Senator Stevens is here.;N
But we also need you as our nominee to help find these creative solutions to there being too many fishers and not enough fish.;N
I am going to put the rest of my prepared remarks into the record so I can recognize my colleague who has been patient, Senator Stevens.;N
I am in another meeting concerning the defense bill right now, but I did want to stop by and thank him for visiting with me.;N
But I do hope that you will look into our situation in Alaska with regard to global climate change.;N
In any event, in Alaska it is real, because there is no question that we now have sea water intrusion in many of our villages.;N
We have a situation up on the Arctic Ocean coast, where public and federal facilities are soon to be inundated with the Arctic Ocean.;N
The permafrost is disappearing in some areas of Alaska and it is coming to other areas of Alaska.;N
So it is not a total balance in terms of whether it is getting warmer or colder up our way, but there is change up there that needs more understanding and we need more basic research.;N
I think if we could catch up and understand what is going on in the Arctic, we might understand what will go on in the rest of the country in years to come.;N
I would like to travel around and show you some of the things that I have seen and hopefully find a way to get you to work with NASA.;N
NASA also is very interested in this and I think that your two agencies could go a long way in trying to get us some understanding that we need of what is changing and why in the Arctic.;N
But I do congratulate you and look forward to working with you, and I am sorry I have to leave, Mr. Chairman.;N
I just appreciate all the help that you and Senator Hollings have given us on these issues.;N
Admiral why do you not go ahead and make any remarks that you choose and then we will have some questions.;N
I appreciate very much the support of the Secretary of Commerce Evans and Deputy Secretary of Commerce Bodman in this appointment and I look forward to working with them.;N
I am very grateful for the courtesy shown to me by the Members of this Committee that I visited this week.;N
I am again, as I say, very happy to be here today at this hearing and looking forward to the future.;N
Senator Stevens certainly articulated some of the major challenges involved with climate change that will affect the whole country and the whole globe, not necessarily just Alaska, although it is deeply felt in that part of our country.;N
We face a number of challenges, not just in the climate change, but in environmental management, environmental monitoring, new energy sources, in biotechnology, biodiversity, medicine and just the general coupling of the atmosphere and the Earth and the ocean systems together for the well-being of humanity.;N
I think that we need to work in the future to support and bring on board all of the disciplines that are needed to build the basic science necessary for good public policy.;N
The Earth and the atmosphere and the oceans remain coupled and the work that we do in the future will affect our economic health and the health and the well-being of each individual of this country and indeed for the world.;N
All of our industries function today on understanding what is happening in the climate and what is happening in their environment.;N
We have enormous challenges in our coastal environment, managing the oceans and the coastal ecology and the atmosphere in those areas as well.;N
I would like to wrap up by saying that I am a strong believer in intergovernmental cooperation.;N
I want to work together with all the agencies that deal with the oceans and the atmosphere.;N
I want to work together with the Congress and the members of the staffs and all the committees that cover this broad area.;N
I am proud to have been nominated and should I have the privilege of earning your confirmation I look forward to working with you.;N
My intent is to serve the President, the Secretary of Commerce, the talented people who make up NOAA today, and our fellow citizens across the nation.;N
As my record shows in the past, I will work hard with the good Members of this Committee, the Senate and the House in building sound programs and building support to enact those programs for the betterment of our country.;N
Admiral Lautenbacher, according to the information that you have given the Committee you do not appear to have a tremendous amount of experience regarding fisheries.;D
I guess it is fair to say that I and other members of the Northwest Congressional delegation will be happy to provide the tutorials.;N
It is critically important that steps be taken to make the industry sustainable, and clearly to deal with the Northwest groundfish fishery we are going to have action for the Administration and the total support of your office.;N
The legislation offers a buyback program funded one-half by federal appropriation and one-half by the industry through a federal loan.;N
I think I would like to start by asking you what alternatives would you propose to voluntarily decrease the number of fishers?;N
Senator, I have to agree with you that I am not experienced in the management of fisheries and that I am learning in this area as well.;N
But to date what I have learned so far is that there are a number of opportunities that we have to combat or to deal with the overfishing.;N
I think some of the proposals that have been made for buybacks, either government-funded or by loans, are very interesting.;N
I know that your support on this bill and interest on this issue are very much appreciated by the Administration and by NOAA.;N
I am delighted to have on the team that has been chosen already to work in NOAA, Dr. Bill Hogarth, who as you mentioned is very experienced in this area, and Bob Lawn, who is the Regional Director in the Northwest and I understand is very knowledgeable about it.;D
I think we need to work together to build a solution that will be protective of our environment as well as ensuring that the economics of fishing maintains its viability.;N
Do you think that there needs to be a faster process to get disaster money out to communities?;N
The reason I am asking this question is that the West Coast groundfish fishery was declared a disaster in January of 2000 and it took nearly 12 months after funding was appropriated.;N
Frankly, at that point I had a hearing on the coast in Oregon and it was clear it was not ever going to get out.;N
We basically said, look, we are going to bring folks there constantly until the money gets out, and finally it did.;N
In our legislation we require NMFS to report to Congress on how they could speed up the distribution of disaster money.;N
I would be interested in whether you think there does need to be a faster process to get it out.;N
I think it is important that emergency assistance should be received by the people who deserve to have it as soon as possible.;N
Now, at present the IRS taxes this money as regular income and at the same time puts families off the food assistance rolls.;N
Fishermen also have to shovel large quantities of fish overboard because of regulatory or market restrictions on what they can bring to the dock.;N
I have been working for years to get NOAA to create a program so we would not have the disgrace of having all of these needy people in the United States and people chucking fish overboard.;N
I think it is very unfortunate and I would be interested in knowing what ideas you have for eliminating this, the waste of this resource.;N
I will have to look into the rules and regulations that have created that situation, Senator.;N
It sounds to me like we need to work on that and I would be happy to work with you to try to solve that situation.;N
I mean, there are pictures repeatedly in major publications all across this country of people throwing fish overboard.;N
It is a disgrace that there is not a system that gets this resource to needy people while at the same time not leading to overfishing and the like, which presumably has been the argument.;N
I hope that you will do better than your predecessor, because your predecessor made a commitment.;N
This is one of the most flagrant examples of waste that I have seen in my years in public service.;N
You are throwing this report overboard when you have needy people, when you have all the economic hurting communities across this country.;N
Tell us what process you think you would like to pursue to ensure better cooperation between the agencies and fishermen and processors in order to address the sustainability question and maintain fishing communities.;N
Again, I would like to address that after I have had a chance to look more at the way the agency works.;N
But, in general, I would say that what I see as a private citizen is, first of all, controversy over the basic science and the pieces that we put together to make, build the criteria on which we judge ourselves.;N
I see contention between the various components and advocates of various parts of our society, working on data which generally is inadequate or not fully thought out.;N
I think that we need a process that builds the proper basic knowledge of science and knowledge of the fishing environment to the point where people at least agree on the basic facts.;N
At that point, I think we need to have a balance in the constituencies that are represented in this important area of our country, both economically and from quality of life.;N
NMFS has been conducting stock assessment surveys in the West Coast groundfish fishery every 3 years instead of every year.;N
So at this point there is not adequate data on 83 of the species that comprise the groundfish fishery.;N
The law states that a precautionary management approach is required to conserve the stocks that we have left.;N
How would you go about complying with that law and making sure that there are resources to conduct scientifically valid assessments on an annual basis?;N
I do not have enough of the details of how the agency does that work or the resources that are involved.;N
This is something I feel very strongly about and I think it is important that when you are before this Committee you can talk at least to some degree specifically about matters that are important to my constituents.;N
This is something that has been in front of the agency for a long time and I hope that you get up to speed on this.;N
I am going to give you some additional questions in writing on the West Coast groundfish fishery.;N
But this is something that I feel very strongly about and I think we have got to get your people working on this and pursuing it vigorously.;N
Let me ask you about one other issue that is important to my constituents and then we will turn to some other matters.;N
NOAA is responsible for making forecasts on water levels in an important part of my state, in the Klamath Basin.;N
Each year the forecast comes out on April 1st, but the farmers have to make their decisions before April 1st.;N
Would you be willing to work with me, and I know my colleague Senator Smith feels very strongly about this as well, to look into a way to help the farmers get the information they need earlier?;N
My background on this tells me that some of that information is available and we should be able to make it available to you much earlier.;N
Ongoing oceanographic research is critical to the nation's understanding of the physical world.;N
I view ocean observing and ocean exploration as kind of the two bookends of the knowledge set that we need to fill up to put on our bookshelf of knowledge about the oceans.;N
I think there remains much to be discovered about the oceans and we need the work at it from both ends, both observations and exploration.;N
Offshore aquaculture has the potential for increasing the amount of domestic fish entering the U.S. market, thereby decreasing the deficit, while at the same time ensuring that aquaculture goes forward in an environmentally sound fashion.;N
I think that is the place where we are going to have the greatest opportunity to increase our economic value of fish and fisheries in the United States.;N
Well, I think we have a lot of issues with the way we set these fish farms up and the research that has been done on the types of breeding and conditions under which they live, in which they can cross-breed with native species.;N
We need lots more work in terms of the basic research on it and we need the support work that is ongoing right now.;N
For many years there have been attempts to eliminate the NOAA corps, as well as the NOAA fleet, both of which are essential in terms of the mapping and charting mission of the agency.;N
The recent public and scientific success of the Ocean Exploration Initiative only underscores the importance of preserving and expanding the fleet and corps.;N
How would you assess the adequacy of NOAA's aircraft and oceanographic fleet to support the current and anticipated needs?;N
Again, I would like more time to assess the requirements, but in general, I believe that the NOAA corps is a valuable part of that agency.;N
I believe that we need the recapitalize the fleet that NOAA uses, as well as the aircraft fleet.;N
These are essential tools in research and basic observation of physical phenomenon that we are all interested in.;N
Would you agree that NOAA's naval deputy could be helpful in procuring new ocean assets for the fleet, like remotely operated vehicles for use by the agency and the university community in ocean exploration?;N
Now, one other area that a number of the Senators on the Committee are interested in is the effectiveness of coastal zone management.;N
In 1972, it was certainly a revolutionary approach to go about addressing the increasing threats posed to fragile coastal areas.;N
Coastal populations, as you know, are growing in many areas of the country and the modern pace of development seems to have outstripped the nation's ability to protect some of these coastal areas.;N
With the thirtieth anniversary coming up in 2002, it seems like an ideal time to take a close look at coastal zone management's effectiveness at the local level.;N
Tell me, if you would, how you would pursue a management review of the program so as to maximize its potential?;N
I think that many of our problems that we are going to face are going to be in the coastal zone.;N
As both you and Senator Stevens have stated, the majority of our population, at least 50 percent at this point, the majority will be living in the coastal areas.;N
I intend to, when I get to NOAA, take a look at the coastal management programs as they are set up and review them and see what needs to be done.;N
Any ideas on strengthening and accelerating coastal protection efforts at the ground level instead of or perhaps in addition to some of the state programmatic grants?;N
Well, I am a believer in partnerships in this area, so I think that we need to continue to partner with the state and local agencies, the federal government.;N
There is a definite need for the regions to be able to come in with their specific needs and deal with it.;N
So I am a supporter of partnerships with the agencies involved in each one of these issues.;N
So often, it just seems that those people come to our community meetings and the like and say, nobody is talking to us, nobody is aware of us.;N
So if you can make sure that the partnership has those people at the table, that is the key.;N
Let me state, just so that the record is clear, that Secretary Evans has been extremely helpful.;N
When we had to get that groundfish money out where it had just been idling for months and months, I think Secretary Evans barely got a chance to get to his phone when I called him.;N
I am blessed to be surrounded by more wisdom and ability in the U.S. Senate than at any time previously, and I thank my colleagues for being here.;N
Admiral, I suppose we could say that you are a native of Stoton, Mass., and your wife, I have just learned, is a native--or at least was born in Brighton--so the hearing could end right there.;N
You are to be congratulated, and all of your family, on an extraordinary career and to reach the post potentially of Commandant--I say potentially, because the formality of this hearing is really all that stands between you, and your confimation--is really terrific.;D
The Coast Guard obviously is largely unknown, a lot of people in America are not aware of its size, 35,000 people in uniform.;N
I think you save on average about 14 lives a day and interdict several hundred tons of cocaine each day on average and provide just an enormous service.;N
A lot of people again are not aware of it, but the Coast Guard is escorting major vessels into our ports in the country.;N
We have an enormous number of ports in America, of rivers, I think about a thousand harbor channels and 25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal and coastal waterways, serving over 300 ports comprised of more than 3,700 terminals.;N
Ninety-five percent of all of the commercial traffic of the United States was carried through the waterways.;N
Unfortunately, as we learned only too well recently, only about two percent of that gets inspected.;N
So the mission for you and the members of the Coast Guard is just getting more and more complicated.;N
We know you are beginning two major acquisition programs, the Integrated Deepwater System that Senators Snowe and Stevens and Inouye and I have fought for for a long time, the Response Systems Modernization Project, and the national distress project, which will greatly improve the service to the country.;D
I think Senator Snowe and I are particularly concerned about the gaps in that service, which happen to fall on New Jersey, New Hampshire, Maryland, and South Carolina, so Senator Hollings obviously also is concerned about it, and it is something we hope will be filled very quickly.;N
But we welcome you and Nancy, and again, we really are grateful for your years of service and look forward to your stewardship in this most important position.;D
Well, I try to go back and forth, but I am happy to break the protocol, particularly since you suggested it.;N
I simply want to associate myself with your remarks, Mr. Chairman, and to simply add by saying that my constituents, the people of Hawaii, respect and love this man.;N
It is a pleasure to be here to formally introduce Vice Admiral Thomas Collins, the President's nominee to become the twenty-second Commandant of the United States Coast Guard.;N
I think Vice Admiral Collins is an excellent choice to lead this organization, and it has an increased level of responsibility now because the men and women of the Coast Guard have taken on additional duties to protect and secure our homeland.;D
He served tours first as a lieutenant and a deck watch officer of the Coast Guard Cutter Vigilant and as Commander of the Coast Guard Cutter Cape Morgan.;D
He then moved into the group operations in St. Petersburg, Florida, and then as Captain of the Port for Long Island Sound and New Haven, Connecticut.;D
His dual background in marine safety and operational issues will be relied on as the Coast Guard's role in homeland security is developed and refined, as I know we must do in coming years.;D
Vice Admiral Collins served as commander of the Pacific Area and the Eleventh Coast Guard District, very close to home, Mr. Chairman.;D
Alaska is the largest district in the Pacific area and the challenges of our area, the North Pacific, are well known to the Admiral.;N
Many of Alaska's fishermen in remote communities depend on the Coast Guard's search and rescue program in the harshest of conditions.;N
The Coast Guard in my State of Alaska, more than half of the coastline of the United States, have a special and important relationship that I know the Vice Admiral appreciates and will continue to foster under his command leadership.;N
I do not know if many of you realize how many babies the Coast Guard actually delivers from time to time in those helicopters, and it really does have a special relationship to us.;N
The selection process that has brought Vice Admiral Collins to this Committee hearing is a very competitive process and you deserve a great deal of credit for having been selected.;D
Your 34 years of dedicated service to this country provides you with a diversity of experience to lead the men and women of our country who will wear the uniform of your service, and I think that you will lead us into the future.;D
It is an uncertain future right now, but it is very certain for the Coast Guard with you as the Commandant.;N
You possess, based on your experience, I think the rare combination of Coast Guard experience, skilled leadership, and experience in working with other agencies.;D
That combination of credentials I think is essential and pivotal in guiding the Coast Guard toward the future.;D
As we know, in the wake of September 11th, the challenges that confront the Coast Guard in fulfilling its Homeland Security responsibilities are tremendous.;N
The Coast Guard has to fulfil these new responsibilities and obligations along with its many other traditional obligations and missions that the American people have come to expect from the Coast Guard.;N
Additonally, I know you will be able to lead the Coast Guard towards modernization, especially the Deepwater Project that is going to be so essential to the Coast Guard's future.;D
I think you provide remarkable experience at a time in which the Coast Guard is certainly going to require it.;D
I know you will continue what Admiral Loy has done over the last 4 years, and I know that the Coast Guard is going to be in good stead for the future.;N
It will provide vital assistance to our Nation's 361 ports in upgrading their existing security system, of which the Coast Guard is an integral part.;N
I might say that the Coast Guard took an integral part, I am sure in an official way, in monitoring the 500,000 people at the Saint Patrick's Day parade in Savannah, and your presence was most welcome.;N
I know you understand this importance as a former captain of a port and you understand the Coast Guard's leadership role for all local, state, and federal officials involved in seaport security.;D
Further, this legislation authorizes additional funding for the Coast Guard to carry out its port security responsibilities.;N
I urge my colleagues in the House to work with the Senate in order to pass the conference report so that you have the resources to do your job.;N
Second, the Coast Guard as the coordinator and leader in port security should work with all entities involved in the security process.;N
I look to the people who work and experience life at the port every day for the most up-to-date information.;N
I believe with better coordination and with the belief in and the feeling of open communication among all groups, public and private, involved in protecting the seaports, we eliminate those weak links.;N
Last, the Coast Guard has duties other than port security, such as search and rescue, drug interdiction, and living marine resources enforcement.;N
I urge you not to overlook these responsibilities as you work to fulfil the heightened importance of port security.;N
I thank you so much for your service to our nation and may God watch over our men and women in uniform.;D
As I say, I do not think we need to prolong this hearing, but we certainly do have some areas we would love to hear your thoughts about.;N
I appreciate your opening comments and certainly the focus of them I think is most appropriate.;N
If I could just ask, on one level my attention was piqued by Senator Stevens, who mentioned Vigilant, and I wondered, where was Vigilant when you reported aboard?;N
It was my very first tour as a new ensign graduating from the Coast Guard Academy in 1968.;N
I was also a first lieutenant for a brief period of time, and we could tell sea stories, I am sure.;N
First lieutenant on the Vigilant and spent many chilly days going through Pollidip Channel in the middle of the winter.;N
On September 10th, Senator Snowe and I, and other Members of the Committee were particularly concerned, and I know as Vice Commandant you heard us ask these questions to the Commandant, Admiral Loy.;N
"The ability to interdict narcotics, which is increasing because there are so many more Americans with addictions, is important; also, the increasingly difficult task of enforcing the fisheries, which is critical in all sectors of our oceans because of the overfishing is also paramount.";N
The more the regulations get tough and try to bring the stocks back, the more important that policing ingredient becomes.;N
But by his own admission, Admiral Loy made it clear to us that the response to September 11th required a cannibalizing of each and every one of those activities.;N
There was not one activity that did not require a redeployment, particularly for the long-term port piece, though some of that has been transferred.;N
So the question for a lot of us is, if I look at the numbers here, I know the President has increased the budget, but a significant amount of this increase is related to non-;N
In other words, not all of this large sum of money is going to go into any of the tasks that I just described.;N
About $736 million is going to payment into the military retirement fund, which we all know is critical.;N
I think $504 million of $1 billion sought for operating expenses is going to current retirement and other benefits and other pay increases and personnel entitlements, which total about $193 million.;N
So that leaves only $303 million out of this entire increase to fund new initiatives and enhance the other missions.;N
I know there is always a can-do attitude and I know you are going to have to say yes, but I would really like to examine this reality.;N
Clearly, in the wake of 9/11, we threw everything but the kitchen sink, including the kitchen sink, at the security issue in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.;N
Since that time, we have been gradually pulling back those resources that were pulsed in to beef up that mission to create a greater state of normalcy relative to the other missions.;N
Clearly, in the case of New England, for example, the first and second quarter of this year saw a rapid decline in the amount of ships devoted to fisheries enforcement off the Massachusetts coast and other areas experienced the same thing.;N
Counter-drugs, fisheries enforcement, and offshore migrant interdiction were those areas where those high end resources were carved out.;N
Based upon direction from Admiral Loy last fall, operational commanders were directed to start moving those resources back into those traditional missions that we peeled them off from.;N
We expect, with the support of the 2003 budget, which we are very pleased with, Mr. Chairman, there is a 20 percent increase in our operating expense appropriation, the largest increase that we have seen in our recent history.;N
There is an increase of 2200 people in this budget, another significant incremental increase.;N
That compared with the 2002 supplemental that we received, which restored some of the cuts in the 2002 budget--if you recall, there was a 15 percent operational reduction within the 2002 budget as it passed last summer.;N
It allowed us to pay the reserves that we called up and also provided for select new initiatives.;N
We expect the second supplemental to come forward from the Administration shortly that will help to keep that momentum.;N
So between that 2002 supplemental and 2003, we have seen some of the most significant incremental increases that we have seen in modern history.;N
About $430 million or so of the $730 million incremental increase in the operating expenses is going into homeland security initiatives.;N
That is the combination of annualizations of 2002 supplemental into 2003 plus new initiatives in 2003, for a total of about $430 million.;N
But there is search and rescue investments that is in the 2003 budget, for example, another 138 or so individuals being put into search and rescue stations, investments in small boats.;N
Between 2002 and 2003, we will have 70 to 80 more small boats that will be introduced in our service because of the support of the 2002-2003 supplemental.;N
Also, if you include the National Distress Modernization System, there is a $90 million capital investment in the 2003 budget for that.;N
So we think there is real solid investments, sir, that will start a multi-year ramp-up for us to deal with both our traditional missions and the homeland security missions.;N
Quite frankly, we would be hard-pressed to bring aboard more than 2200 people in 1 year, between 2002 and 2003.;N
In order to realize a net gain of 2200 people in those 2 years, we have to attract about 4800 new people into the Coast Guard, considering attrition and so forth.;N
So all in all, I think we are going to do well with the 2003 budget and the supplemental, and when we get to sort of a steady state as they play out, we will be within about 5 percent of those other missions, probably 5 or 6 percent off on meeting the traditional programmed hours in those other missions.;N
Clearly, if you talk to the CNO in the Navy and you ask him what his job one is, he would probably tell you manpower.;N
I think it is all the services' challenge to attract capable men and women and keep them in the service.;D
We have seen in the last 6 months a turn-around a little bit in the retention, a positive turn-around up to 5 percent improvement, depending how you read the numbers.;N
"I think it is a combination of maybe the economy, No. 1; No. 2, the realization of the relevancy of our mission and what it contributes to the Nation.";N
Third, I think people recognize that we are an organization who care very much about our people.;N
We are going to continue to do that and we are going to invest in training and education and professional development.;N
We have increased our sea pay, for example, a tiered sea pay, a bonus system that will make going to sea attractive for our men and women.;N
Talking to our Master Chief of the Coast Guard just the other day, he really felt that what is resonating with the men and women of the Coast Guard and the other armed services is that Congress, the Administration, the American people are paying attention to the needs of our armed forces by making pay and compensation a high priority.;N
If you look at the medical benefits, if you look at the pay and the housing benefits that have come to pass over the last several years, they are making a difference.;N
I would urge to keep the pressure on in that regard because I think it is resonating and it will turn some of these numbers around.;N
I mean, I know you indicated a little bit of an upturn, but do you sense that we are doing enough or is there more you would like to see us do?;N
I mean, if you had your druthers here and speaking on behalf of those folks now, do you think we should be approaching this differently?;N
I think the professional development training is an area that we still can make some gains on and it is very relevant, professional development training is very relevant to the new generation of people coming in.;N
We have just got to keep the pressure on there, keep improving our pay and compensation, the housing for example.;N
pocket costs for housing, BAH, has been a major push and that is gradually going to get better and better for our men and women.;N
I think we cannot just draw a conclusion on one data point of 3 or 4 months, but I think over time we are going to see that the attention that Congress and the Administration has paid to pay and compensation for our men and women and their professional development will pay off in the high quality armed forces.;N
I agree with that, except that I have heard from some people that, notwithstanding what they sense are some good opportunities in that regard and may be improving, the time, the deployment time itself, is sort of a cruncher, and even in some of the boat stations on the coastline, summertime deployment, etcetera, there is just an on versus off ratio that is really tugging at some people.;N
Some of our investments in the 2002 budget and the 2003 budget in terms of increasing the personnel at search and rescue stations is all about reducing that work hours at station.;N
You know, we are creating these Maritime Safety and Security Teams, four of them through the 2003 budget, teams of 70 active duty people plus additional reservists.;N
They will be located at selected areas around the country to provide search operations for security, safety, aftermath of hurricanes, and the like.;N
They will, in effect, be also an investment in our search and rescue stations because they ease the pressure on those search and rescue stations to provide those kind of skills.;N
So it is another presence, a presence in our coastal waterways, that eases some of that OPTEMPO, PERSTEMPO pressure on our stations.;N
Last year we appropriated, I think, about $290 million for the Deepwater Asset Refurbishment and I think this year there is a $500 million request.;N
Are we thinking in terms pre-September that perhaps should be changed now because of the demands for port security, inspection, Customs, Immigration, all those components?;N
Our answer is that we think the Deepwater Project is right smack dead on center in the type of capability we need for homeland security and for other missions.;N
I would submit that counter-drugs is part of homeland security, protecting our borders is part of homeland security, pushing our borders out is part of homeland security and a wonderful strategy for us to pursue.;N
The Deepwater Project is a C4ISR, a command and control, information-centric procurement, a system of systems.;N
The central feature of that is giving us sensors, communication capability, and interoperability, the ability to interdict, detect, surveil, classify, prosecute cases at sea.;N
It is just the type of capabilities that we need to embed for homeland security, including counter-drug ops and others.;N
What do you hope to be known for as Commandant if there is sort of one overriding thing, beyond being a great Commandant because you come from Massachusetts?;N
If you recall, his two broad themes are restoring readiness and shaping the future, with several sub-objectives.;N
I think if our motto is ``Semper Paratus'' and we do not have readiness as part of our vision, there is something wrong.;N
Readiness, taking care of our people and being good stewards of the American taxpayers' interest is what I would like to be known for.;N
In keeping with that, I would like to be known that we have got the Deepwater Project off and running with a bang, that it is well situated, a strategic partnership established with the winning contractors, and that project is producing good things for us, as well as the National Distress and Modernization System Project that, as a previous group commander, I know how vital that capability is to the public in our coastal waters.;N
We need to do that one right and we are going to do that one right, and we are going to address all those gaps that you are concerned with.;N
That is going to be a wonderful system, giving us 98 percent in the performance standard, 98 percent chance of connectivity in terms of communications.;N
And oh, by the way, that is higher than what your average police and fire department and for public safety operations.;N
So I would like to be known to get those two projects off and running, taking care of our people, increasing our retention, and preserving our operational excellence and readiness, sir.;N
Admiral Collins, just to follow up on the budget issue, are you comfortable with the billion dollar increase?;N
I think, Senator Snowe, along with the supplementals, the 2002 supplemental and the forthcoming supplemental, that we expect to be submitted shortly, it will give us that first year increment of a 3-year plan or so that we are developing to build out homeland security competence and capability while taking care of the rest of the mission.;N
It is an evolving plan, as everything is in the wake of 9/11 because it is a new world, new realities that we are building to.;N
I think what you can expect to see ultimately in a 2004 or 2005 budget as it rolls up is some of the very same things that appear, just a continued buildout of those same things that appear in 2003.;N
For example, Sea Marshalls, the Sea Marshall concept to ensure the positive control of vessels in our waterways, which is a major goal of our strategic plan.;N
Another major goal is Maritime Domain Awareness, that concept where we have clarity and visibility in our area of responsibility of people, cargo, and platforms, so that we can take preventative action, not consequence management action.;N
But significant investments in communications, secure communications, intelligence, and so forth, that is part of that MDA, or Maritime Domain Awareness.;N
That gives us another part of our strategic goal, which is presence, increased presence in our ports for deterrence and response capability.;N
Also, protection of critical infrastructure and force protection for our own men and women, things like weapons, ammunition, chemical, biological, and radiological detection, protection equipment.;N
Those are the kind of things that you would expect to see, in addition to outreach and partnership, goal five of our strategic plan, with industry and with other government agencies, local agencies.;N
This requires the most important features--collaboration and outreach, and I would submit not only domestically, but internationally.;N
One of the reasons why Admiral Jim Loy went over to IMO last fall and addressed the general assembly and got a unanimous resolution to aggressively pursue internationally enhanced security for shipping, because part of this an international threat and part of the solution has to be an international solution.;N
Let's turn to the whole modernization program, such as Deepwater, as well as the National Distress and Response System.;N
First of all, with Deepwater, do you think there should be any modifications to that program as a result of September 11th?;N
The way the requirement is defined and the way the structure of the contract will be set up, if adjustments need to be made I think they will need to be made on the margin.;N
But I see there may be some adjustments, but adjustments on the margin, that the basic feature of Deepwater, which is a system of systems, which is information-centric, which is all about coordinating our aircraft and our surface assets so they work as a system and a network, is the very thing that homeland security calls for.;N
As the Chairman mentioned about the National Response and Distress System, there are still existing gaps.;N
We are going to be hearing testimony in subsequent panels about the Department of Transportation IG report which stated that there are still going to be gaps across this country.;N
The original purpose of this initiative was to address and correct all the gaps in the system.;N
Now we are modifying it because of the cost, but at the same time we are back to where we started in many ways.;N
The approach, Senator, to the project is not to take the existing system and say these were the gaps and let us go plug them.;N
What it is is taking a more blank sheet of paper and redrawing, reconfiguring the entire system with a brand new buildout that gives you digital capability, direction-finding capability, and so forth.;N
Atlantic City, Group Atlantic City, for example, will be one of the early initial operating capabilities.;N
Each one of those areas, the industry will come in, the winning contractor will come in and do a detailed survey of that area, and then look at where he has to site towers and so forth to ensure he meets the performance requirement of the contract.;N
The performance requirement of the contract calls for 98 percent probability of communications.;N
The contractor is going to have to meet those minimum performance standards region by region by region as it is built out.;N
The way it is being built out, there is one region built on and then the next adjacent region is built out, so we build off the tower structure of one region against the other region to the other region.;N
We want 98 percent connectivity, and I think that is what we are going to get when this gets awarded.;N
I certainly hope that you work with this Committee on that issue, because I think we have to make sure that we provide the kind of communications coverage that is essential.;N
I would be glad to provide a brief to your staff, you or your staff, on the details of that as you desire, Senator.;N
This is another area which I really do think we have to address in terms of the operations tempo.;N
I know I have talked to my station in Eastport, and I know the demands that have been placed on them and the long hours.;N
It needs to be addressed and we have to rectify it, because it is a matter of safety and providing for the safety on our coastal waterways.;N
I do know the OPTEMPO rates are obviously very high and so we need to take corrective action on that score for the future.;N
Yes, Senator, clearly whatever shortfalls we had at the stations were exacerbated by 9/11 and the OPTEMPO that we push ourselves toward to meet the security needs of our ports and waterways.;N
I think the 2002 and 2003 game plan and along with out years for search and rescue meets many of the previously discussed issues associated with our search and rescue stations, whether that be boat readiness or whether it be amount of people and so forth.;N
The 2002 budget provided close to 200 people, additional people for our search and rescue stations.;N
The 2003 budget provides 138 people additional to be distributed to our search and rescue stations.;N
In addition, there is another increment of, I think, about 30 or so, if I have got the numbers right, for our groups, the command centers, our Coast Guard groups.;N
In addition, I will state again, those maritime safety and security teams, those new units that we are creating six through the 2003 budget, that is 498 people going into those teams around the country.;N
They represent boatswain mates, MKs, and the like that are going to be operating boats in coastal areas.;N
So a combination of the plus-up in the SAR station plus the maritime safety and security team will move us a long way along solving some of those OPTEMPO, PERSTEMPO problems, Senator that you mentioned.;N
We appreciate it and we know that you are going to provide remarkable leadership in the future, and it is certainly indicative of the kind of career that you already have amassed.;D
"Notwithstanding the increases, the increases are going to an increased set of responsibilities; is that correct?";N
In other words, the increases you have just talked about, the new personnel, the 2200, are being divided and 400-plus some are going directly into the special security.;N
But others are going to be going into port security and these other security demands, correct?;N
What happens to you getting into May and proceeding forward in the next months on that station demand, plus the new responsibilities, when already prior to September 11th you did not have enough people to do everything we were asking you to do?;N
An additional increment is going in to provide the fourth crew member for our new 47-foot MLB.;N
This Committee is completely bipartisan to making sure that the Coast Guard has the resources it needs.;N
I think we have been, frankly, one of the loudest and most persistent voices on a bipartisan basis over the years for what we think has been an underfunding of your important agency.;N
So we hope you are going to be frank with us as we go forward here, because these responsibilities are critical.;N
Senator Snowe and I feel very deeply about the inadequacy of the monitoring of the fisheries.;N
It is just inadequate, and we are going from 88 days maybe down to 22, depending on what happens here in New England in the groundfish fishery.;N
The havoc that is going to create among our fisherpeople and the pressures it is going to create, frankly, for people that go look outside of those parameters.;N
If we do not have sufficient enforcement mechanism, we are not going to make those stock goals.;N
So it is really crunch time and I think 9/11 sort of woke people up to the extraordinary demands and the number of waterway, port security issues that we face.;N
Maybe all of it does not have to fall on your agency and, needless to say, a lot of it will not as we sort of hone this, though it would be helpful for us to hear from the person in charge of it so we could begin to understand exactly how those demands are being divided, which is another issue, not for us here at this moment.;N
So we are going to work with you and hope you will work with us as we try to figure out what is necessary.;N
I think homeland security is our narcotics effort and I think homeland security is also our protection of our ecosystem.;N
But the nefarious networks that use the narcotics trafficking channels are the very same people what also provide illegal passports, illegal visas, money accounts that are hidden, who play to the proliferation issues, and so forth.;N
So your ability to perform that function in my judgment is at the front line of any homeland security effort, and we need to make certain that that $37 billion is enough to do some of the other things we may choose to do.;N
Is there any conflict that the Committee should be aware of that might in any way affect the performance of your responsibilities as Commandant?;N
Do you agree to appear before the Committee at such time as the Committee duly sends you appropriate request to do so in the course of your tenure?;N
Assuming we can move your nomination very rapidly, and we are going to try and do that--we will hold a Committee meeting off the floor of the Senate, hopefully, to be able to move it to the floor rapidly.;N
Assuming we are able to confirm you this week, when would this change of command take place under those circumstances?;N
We thank you very much for the job you have done as a prelude to this enormously important job you are about to do.;N
We hope you will feel the Committee is available to you to be as cooperative and as thoughtful as possible as we try to resolve these important issues for our country.;N
It has been a pleasure to appear before you today and I do look forward to working very closely with the Committee.;N
It's my pleasure to convene this hearing today to consider the nomination of Dr. James Mahoney to be the Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere and Deputy Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.;N
He's joined today, I gather, by his wife, Taya, back there with his twin daughters, Caitlin and Courtney, and daughter, Deborah, and sons, James and Robert, who I've just been informed are good constituents of mine in Massachusetts.;N
I was telling your father a moment ago that, given his roots in Massachusetts 25 years long, we probably don't need a hearing, but we're going to do it anyway.;N
I'm also very happy to welcome Deputy Secretary of Commerce, Sam Bodman, also from Massachusetts, and NOAA Administrator, Admiral Lautenbacher.;N
We're delighted to have you here, and thank you for taking time to be here in support of the nominee, which we note.;N
Let me just say very quickly that we want to try to expedite the hearing and that Senator Gregg has a pressing commitment upstairs, so we'll try to move along fast, but I don't want to shortchange the importance of this job.;N
NOAA really came into existence due to the great efforts of our Chairman of this Committee, Senator Hollings, in 1970, and its purpose was to protect life and property from natural hazards and also to help us understand the total environment and lead to intelligent use of our natural resources.;N
There's an annual appropriation of over $3 billion, which represents 60 percent of the budget of the Commerce Department--12,000 employees.;N
Many people, former secretaries, have come before us--and I think particularly of Ron Brown and Bill Daley and others in the past--they're always shocked to learn that the Commerce Department has a Navy as well as this extraordinary responsibility.;N
More than 30 percent of the gross domestic product of our country is generated in the coastal zone, and 40 percent of all the new commercial and residential development is along the coast.;N
Predictions are that in about 20 years, 75 percent of all Americans are going to live in coastal areas, so we have an enormous burden on us, and the marine-related protection issues are huge.;N
Senator Snowe and I would particularly wish that the councils would be able to manage these things.;N
And last year we landed roughly--this is an extraordinary statistic--we landed 9 billion pounds of fish with a value of about $3.5 billion.;N
And I'm pleased to say that New Bedford has returned to its status as the number-one fishing port, in terms of dockside revenues, with over $146 million in landings.;N
We have troubles in almost every one of our own fisheries surrounding the United States, from the salmon in the Northwest to the tuna to the Gulf of Mexico to the migratory species off the Atlantic coast and obviously, Georges Bank.;N
And then on the outside, you have all of the weather prediction in which, I must say, NOAA does an extraordinary job.;N
They were so accurate, even as it twisted and turned, giving people notice, which was important to saving life and property.;N
And you come with, I must say, a terrific background and a terrific set of preparations for it.;D
And obviously in the Pacific Northwest, where we now have the highest unemployment rate in the country, we care tremendously about the issues that Senator Kerry has talked about.;N
We have got to get the right number of fishers out there at the right time, catching the right number of fish to make this industry sustainable.;N
At the same time, we want to make sure that we don't shortchange science in the conservation issues that are so critical.;N
As I told you yesterday in our meeting, Dr. Mahoney, I'm going to support your nomination here this morning.;N
We want to see you work with Bill Hogarth, who has been very forthcoming in our region, in terms of working with us, and getting results.;N
We've got to have a buy-back program that gets the right number of people at the right time, in effect, doing the things that are based on sound science.;N
Second, we want you to follow up on a promise that NMFS made to me personally and the people of our region to do something about this bycatch issue.;N
There are pictures of huge numbers of fish coming as a result of inadvertent catch to the shore, and they're being thrown away.;N
It is a real disgrace, and the agency has promised action on it, and it has not been forthcoming.;N
I'm particularly pleased Senator Gregg is here, actually, to hear both of these comments, because he has a critical role in the Congress as one of our chief appropriators.;D
One of the most difficult aspects of resolving the protection of fisheries--and obviously, New Hampshire is a participant in this--is finding a sensible way to reduce the fishing effort.;N
And we've tried to augment the buy-back program so we literally get people out of fishing.;N
Other countries are doing that to smart avail, and I think it's something we really need to think about expanding the program.;N
There's just too much money chasing too few fish, and we need to have a balance in it, and that seems like an equitable way to reduce people who've been at it for generations but who are prepared, perhaps, to sell their equity in it.;N
Senator Gregg, thank you for taking time to be here, and we look forward to your introduction.;N
It's a pleasure to be here today and join the Committee in welcoming Dr. Jim Mahoney, who is being put forward for the NOAA position.;N
I consider it to be one of the true jewels of the federal government in that it is a science agency that does extraordinary work and is on the cutting edge of science that is critical to us as a nation and our survival, not only economically, but internationally and in a lot of strategic ways.;D
And, of course, it's critical to the protection of the American people because it does warn us when tornados are coming and where hurricanes are going to hit.;N
I have had the good fortune to be serving on the Subcommittee on Appropriations, and be Chairman of that Committee and now Ranking Member on it, which has jurisdiction over NOAA.;N
The Senate has always been an aggressive supporter of NOAA, as the Chairman of this Committee has been.;N
Not only the Chairman of the subcommittee, but the Chairman of the Full Committee have been key players in making that sure that NOAA receives the funding support it needs.;N
And the successes of NOAA will continue if it continues to attract people like Dr. Mahoney.;N
And it's wonderful to see Taya and Caitlin and Courtney here, who are great enthusiasts and who we enjoyed as neighbors.;N
Unfortunately, they moved away just a little while ago, but they brought a lot of life and excitement to our street.;N
And as a result of getting to know the Mahoneys personally, I can say, without any sort of qualification, that he will be an extraordinary asset to the government.;D
The fact that he's decided to rejoin the government, I think, is a great plus to us as a government.;D
The fact that a lot of his knowledge and base and experience comes from Massachusetts is only an extra plus.;D
Having an MIT degree in meteorology and being past President of the American Society of Meteorology and then teaching at Harvard for a number of years--I think almost 20 years, he also has an expertise in the private sector.;D
He appreciates the needs of the private sector as they integrate with the scientific community.;N
From my viewpoint, as I say, we are fortunate to have people like this who are willing to go back into public service, people like Dr. Mahoney.;D
I know he'll be a tremendous addition to NOAA, and I look forward to working with him in the appropriating process to make sure that NOAA receives the support it needs in order to continue to do its mission which is so critical for our country.;N
I'm confident that all the interested parties in this area will be even more delighted to know that since you're on the Appropriations Committee, this special personal relationship will do well for the agency.;N
Let me just say to everybody we do have a hearing coming on at the conclusion of this nomination hearing on the important subject of CAFE standards, so we're going to try to expedite this as rapidly as we can, and I'm sure you won't object to that.;N
I appreciate your comments, and I think every Member of the Committee would agree that the description of the involvements that you've had could not more effectively prepare you for the task that you're going to undertake here, so we certainly welcome that.;N
Is there any item or issue that the Committee should be aware of that might present you with any kind of conflict of interest in the performance of these duties?;N
And in the course of the preparation for this, is there any holding or asset that you've had to divest of in order to put yourself in a position to perform these responsibilities without conflict?;N
So it sounds like you're commending yourself also for your good judgment because you don't hold Enron or K-;N
Have you and the Administrator, Admiral Lautenbacher, divided up how you're going to proceed, in terms of the management issues?;N
I mean, can you tell the Committee what particular responsibilities at this point you will be assuming, versus he?;N
Let me also add to that the question--he obviously comes with a background with respect to the ocean component of this.;N
I think some of us are concerned about where the live marine resources fit in between the two.;N
I have a couple more questions, but I appreciate what you've just said, and I think it probably makes the most sense to have that kind of deputy relationship where there is cross-fertilization.;N
The key concern to this Committee--I mean, in the 18 years that I've been involved with the fisheries issues--and Senator Hollings, a lot longer, and Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye and others on this Committee--there's been a deep disappointment.;N
You know, each year that we do the Magnuson or each year that we structure--every few years when we do it--we wrestle with this question of keeping the democracy of the councils where local input, local decisions, are able to be made and people are really controlling their own destiny, balanced against the inevitable, parochial tensions that prevent decisions from being made at all.;N
And to some degree the predicament of our fisheries on a national basis is the unwillingness of people to resolve those issues and bite the bullet.;N
A number of years ago, we empowered the Secretary--and obviously you, through the Secretary--to intervene in a way that makes the difference.;N
But I wonder if you'd just comment quickly on that, because there is a frustration, and we are going to be doing Magnuson again, and we need to come to grips with this issue.;N
Let me just say to everybody we want to try, if we can, to expedite so we can get into the CAFE hearing.;N
Speak for a minute, if you would, to those fishing families, say, on the Oregon coast, like in Newport.;N
They are looking to deliver a buy-back program so that you get the right number of people at the right time, catching the right number of fish, so that there's a sustainable resource.;N
And obviously I'm just looking to see that you've got a commitment and that you're going to follow up.;N
This question of bycatch is critical because a tremendous number of fish are being wasted.;N
It's an incredible public disgrace at a time when we don't have all the fish that we need for any kind of a sustainable resource.;N
What are you prepared--again, on the basis of the fact that you can't make any specific commitments--to do, in a general way, to follow up on this issue?;N
If and when you're confirmed, and you'll have my support, can I get a call from you in 2 weeks to give me more specifics on both of these questions?;N
Well, that's a surefire way to get confirmed is to bring two young ladies like that to our hearing.;N
I did want to mention one issue to you, and I'm not doing it in a way that's unfair to you.;N
I know that you will not have known of this or studied it, but I know that Admiral Lautenbacher is in the room, and I believe Sam Bodman is here.;N
We've had a long, tortured problem between the National Weather Service, NOAA, and Williston, North Dakota.;N
They didn't put very many of them up in our part of the country, so the one that serves northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana is in a place called Deering, North Dakota.;N
These low-formation, quick-moving winter storms are killer storms, and yet we were going to be left out of radar coverage for those kinds of storms with NEXRAD.;N
And so the weather service at first denied it, but all the experts studied it and said, yes, this is an area of significance.;N
So they've kept the Williston weather radar open for the last 4 or 5 years until they complete all these other studies.;N
The people they've interviewed to try to replace them, the weather service has said to them, ``By the way, you know, we might shut this down in the future, and we don't pay moving expenses, so we're interviewing you for a job you might not want to take.'';N
I think there's been a lack of good faith here on the part of some people, and I'd like to work with you and with Admiral Lautenbacher and Sam Bodman to see if we can resolve this.;N
Williston, North Dakota, and the people who are ranchers and others who live in that part of North Dakota and Montana have as much right to accurate and good weather forecasting and weather radar as someone in New York or Chicago.;N
But, in fact, it is not the case with the NEXRAD system, and we have, frankly, not had the kind of help that I would have liked from the National Weather Service and NOAA in the past several Administrations.;N
I just received a call again yesterday, and I was surprised again by the latest information.;N
Thanks for bringing your daughters to this hearing, and I look forward to working with you, Dr. Mahoney.;N
Why do you suppose that there is still a large body of opinion in America that refuse to recognize this reality?;N
I hope you'll give this issue the priority that it deserves, which is the highest priority.;N
Finally, do you believe that the oceans of the world are becoming polluted to an alarming degree?;N
Mr. Chairman, I just want to follow up Senator McCain's line of questioning and thank him again for being very bold on a number of questions and daring to tread in certain areas that otherwise might not think that someone in his party would do.;N
And even though it doesn't dramatically affect his state of Arizona, it sure affects my state of Florida, because the rise of the oceans, the increase of the temperature, the increase of pestilence, the increase of tremendous storms called hurricanes, and so forth.;N
And, you know, we'd best get about the process of recognizing that, in fact, we do have a problem and stop sticking our heads in the sand.;N
You have a tremendous background, educationally, with a Ph.D. in meteorology, and that's going to be very important to your work over there.;D
I was just wondering, do you have an idea, with Admiral Lautenbacher, how you all are going to divide up the fisheries areas?;N
But also in the fisheries areas, which is important, as well, have you all had discussions on how those areas are going to be divided up?;N
I think that while you are an expert in weather and you know the violence of a summer thunderstorm, I would suggest that you really haven't seen anything violent until you've been through a shrimp meeting on the turtle excluder devices in south Louisiana.;D
I think all of that said, a few years ago, I commented to somebody that if you ever wanted to do a perfect study on government regulatory process and the difficulties and the varied forces pulling and tugging, the fisheries are perhaps one of the most ideal.;N
But what is not complicated is understanding that the consequence of the inaction that comes from not making some choices between those tensions is disastrous.;N
Now people are going out and catching, you know, regulation-size stripers, and we brought it back.;N
And we're going to now move into a component of the morning's business that reflects questions of Senator McCain and Senator Nelson's concern, which we all share.;N
There's been a lot of procrastination about how we ought to make some choices with respect to emissions and global gases, and a lot of people's patience is wearing thin on it.;N
But we really do look to you for leadership and guidance with respect to those issues also.;D
We have worked very hard on this on the Committee and I will be frank to say that there were some of us who at the beginning felt that the law enforcement aspect of this ought to be done through the Department of Justice, not out of any lack of consideration for the Department of Transportation, just because the Department of Justice obviously had more law enforcement experience at a deeper level.;N
It did not work out that way and we are not disappointed in that because the responsibility now rests under the law with the Department of Transportation and with you, sir, as the person who will be in charge of that.;N
I will say that I think all of us on this Committee believe that the status quo is not acceptable.;N
But anybody who boards planes in West Virginia has the same right, it seems to me, to security as somebody who boards a big plane in Chicago or some other place.;N
We did that because we think that it is part of what our responsibility to take a system which is accustomed to operating more or less at a certain level and saying, no, this is different, September 11th changed the world and it is going to change all of us.;N
It certainly has changed the way we have and have not done business in the Congress, and it has to change the way everybody operates.;N
You obviously face a lot of very critical deadlines, by putting out new screening employee standards right away and screening every ongoing passenger aircraft by mid-January--that is a deadline of pressure.;N
That is the one thing we cannot accept and I think that is the one thing where we will be very nettlesome in the national interest.;N
During the Second World War it was really stunning the way factories all of a sudden sprung up and they were producing tanks and airplanes, and they had been producing other things before and then like that, all of a sudden, women were in the workforce.;N
It is much more complex, and in a sense it has given the country a chance to say: All right, let us prepare ourselves for the next 25 or 40 years because we think this is what we are going to be facing, so we better do it right and we have to do it fast, because 2 years from now, if something happens 2 months from now, is not good enough.;N
The hiring, training, and deploying of more than 30,000 people, that is not going to be easy.;N
New technologies, new systems, that will be perhaps more easy, but needs to be hurried along.;N
What is the relationship between screeners and intelligence agencies within our own country and other countries in terms of monitoring a suspicious passenger.;N
We know, for example, that you are going to have to purchase a thousand new EDSs, and they are meant to be a million dollars apiece.;N
It was all about biometrics and that is the whole interesting part of the technology of all of this.;N
We do oversight, but in this case we are all on the same side in the national interest, and therefore we are pushing like you are pushing, and we want to hear how you are pushing, understanding that neither of us want no for an answer.;N
With that, if the Ranking Member, or obviously, the Chairman of the Full Committee want to make a statement, or anybody else, I would be happy to have that, and then we will hear from you gentlemen.;N
We welcome our colleague Senator Specter, who has an interest in this particular hearing, to sit with the Committee and participate.;N
We have got it cleared now by the Department of Transportation and by the Office of Management and Budget.;N
But we have got political machinations going on the floor and we know that bin Laden and his terrorist group came into the port of Mombassa, offloaded their terrorists and their explosives, blew up the embassies in both Kenya and Tanzania, and that could happen to us very easily because we do not have any port security and we have got to move this as expeditiously as we possibly can.;N
In that light, we have not, in this Senator's judgment, moved as expeditiously on airline security.;N
We wasted a month on this side of the Capitol trying to put employees, airline employees that we thought we had taken care of under the bailout, on the airline security bill, and we wasted another month over on the House side with Mr. DeLay calling up the lobbyists and saying: Come on up and please lobby us and help us get the votes for what the House voted on almost unanimously, only 9 dissenting votes, for.;N
What nettles this particular Senator is the constant PR coming out of the Department of Transportation how difficult it is, how we are never going to be able to get it, how we cannot do this and we cannot do that.;N
I am going to travel again this weekend, as I have almost every weekend this year, in air travel, and I do not like to be delayed.;N
But foremost now, and that has got to be in our minds, is the security and the checking of that baggage, as well as the securing of that airplane itself.;N
We know it is tough all the way around, and let us see how it works out and we are going to be working together on it.;N
But tell whoever is putting it out that, whatever it is, he cannot get the equipment, he cannot do this, he cannot do that, we want to know what can be done.;N
In that light, just tell DOT's PR person to take a weekend off, come back, and say: We are doing all we possibly can.;N
That is what we want to know, and then we will check to see that that is a true statement.;N
Also, I want to be on the floor to support Senator Hollings on this very important seaport security issue.;N
I want to congratulate the Chairman for his almost singlehanded effort to bring this important issue to fruition before we leave for our break.;N
I believe the President should have the right to select the people that he feels are most qualified to serve him in this very important, very critical position.;N
I also feel that Mr. Magaw's accomplishments at ATF are on the record and indicate that he is well qualified to perform these functions.;D
The first is that when it comes to actually implementing airline security rules there is a long history of backsliding, of whittling down, of lost momentum.;N
What I want to hear this morning from Mr. Magaw is how it is going to be different this time.;N
As of right now, there is something like only 160 of the 2,000 screening devices that are needed in place.;N
I also want to hear how Mr. Magaw is going to use the huge amount of power that this office has been given in terms of transportation security to bypass the traditional rulemaking kind of process.;N
There is an opportunity here to really expedite the security rules that are necessary and I want to hear how that is going to be used.;N
At the end of the day, if the job is going to get done right in terms of airline security, Mr. Magaw, you are going to have to be the point person to get it done, and I want to make sure this time it is going to be different than the history of the last 10 or 15 years where there would be a tragedy, Congress would respond, and then there would be slow motion implementation.;N
I thank Chairman Rockefeller, who as usual is working with our colleagues, for the chance to make this opening statement, and I yield my time.;N
Like so many people here, I think we got off to a rocky start on this transportation security bill and the process has not been perfect.;N
I think it is a very positive sign that President Bush has made this very early appointment.;N
He has said this is a top priority, and we need the person in place who is going to have the full responsibility of putting the system in place.;N
I am going to support your nomination, and I think we can learn from some of the lapses of the past and go forward and do things right.;N
One of the things that has concerned me is the record of the FAA and the Department of Transportation missing congressionally-mandated deadlines.;N
We have waited 5 years for a rule setting forth the qualifications and standards for security screening companies.;N
I think it was the lack of progress that caused many of the lapses that people see in airports across the country, specifically, in airport screening and the lack of professionalism.;N
They decided to take it out by its roots and start from scratch and put in a professional law enforcement security system in our airports.;N
I think both you gentlemen can understand why I am proud to work with Kay Bailey Hutchison.;N
That was a superb and thoughtful statement, which will be followed by another one by Conrad Burns.;N
You know, as we worked our way through the new law it kept coming back to me that, how do we protect the American public or anybody and keep them safe as long as you have a mind set that those who would commit such horrendous acts are willing to die in the commitment of that act?;N
Also, on September the 11th, how many laws were broken other than the hijacking of the airplane or the commitment of crimes of harm and injury to the people?;N
I would imagine that it will have to be revisited later to change some things because of just the nature of the beast more than anything else.;N
So I congratulate you for stepping forward and I look forward to working with you and the Department of Transportation as we try to get this in place and make it work.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for permitting me to participate briefly in this proceeding.;N
Senator Craig, who was in the hearing of the subcommittee and I met extensively for a little more than an hour with Mr. Magaw on Tuesday, and I wanted to bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues expeditiously because I am very much concerned that the Secretary and the Administration be able to move ahead very promptly with the critical issue of airport security.;N
Very briefly stated, Ruby Ridge was an incident which occurred in August 1992, which originated when agents of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms contacted Randy Weaver, entrapping him and asking him to sell them sawed-off shotguns.;N
When I say ``entrap,'' a pretty clear case, based on my experience in the criminal law, also the conclusion of the jury which acquitted Weaver on those charges.;N
When Weaver did get two sawed-off shotguns, the ATF agents then sought to have him be an informant, which he declined.;N
Weaver did not get notice of the hearing and did not show up, and the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit informed the U.S. Attorney's Office that Weaver was suspected of bank robberies, which was, in fact, false, and that he had certain convictions.;N
As a result, the marshals went to arrest Weaver and during the course of their effort to arrest him, there was a firefight.;N
U.S. Marshal Deagan was killed and Randy Weaver's 14-year-old son Sammy Weaver was killed.;N
Then the matter became the subject of a full-scale Federal invasion, with the FBI getting into the matter and the hostage rescue team being dispatched.;N
The subcommittee found that the conduct of the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was atrocious, many, many mistakes made.;N
As a result of those hearings, FBI Director Freeh conceded that the FBI was wrong and changed the rules of engagement, conceded that the use of deadly force was, in fact, unconstitutional.;N
Obviously, I think we now turn to our two witnesses, Senator Mineta, Under Secretary Designate, who will have my vote, Mr. Magaw.;N
We are very grateful that you came, Mr. Secretary, and we wish you well at your next hearing.;N
Mr. Chairman, I would just like to also thank the Secretary for coming and highlighting the importance of this part of his Administration and say that I look forward to having him work with us in this positive way.;N
You are certainly right about the gravity of the position to which I think you will be easily confirmed.;N
One has to do with the screeners, which is kind of what got the most attention during the debate up and until the bill.;N
The law specifically says: ``Notwithstanding any other position of the law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment in Federal service for such members or individuals as the Under Secretary determines may be necessary to carry out the screening functions.'';N
``The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.'';N
During the course of the debate, there was a lot of discussion, and some of it probably unfair and read as--interpreted as hostile to some of those who were screening, who were trying to hold down two jobs and getting 4 hours of sleep a night because of that, that we are dealing here with first-class citizens, and I want to make sure we are.;N
We are doing that in a variety of ways because we have made a lot of money, much more money available for salaries.;N
"Now it is 30,000, and it is a lot of people when you hire, when you have to go out and get a lot of people fairly fast, screen them; the FBI overloaded already; maybe you will be doing that yourself--I would like to hear about that if that is the case--";N
find out what their backgrounds are, and then to train them, as well as to watch them as they start their work screening.;N
I am talking about also the people who check 100 percent of the baggage that goes into the cargoes, where damage can be done even more easily.;N
It is going to be very important that the concept of fairness and equal treatment, that they feel that, because my own view is that one of the reasons that the average rate of their service was 3 months on a national basis was, one, they were not being paid anything, were not getting health benefits for the most part, but also that they were not being treated with respect.;N
esteem except as they felt they were doing their jobs or were told that they were not doing their jobs, either by the American public through its impatience or by the media or by us.;N
So I would like to have a little bit of your philosophy about as these folks are selected, backgrounded, trained, put into position, watched, developed, etcetera, because these are people that we want for the longer term, that that is going to be done carefully, wisely, thoughtfully, and fairly.;N
Again and again, the airline industry offers these arguments for extending the deadlines in the law.;N
We have already got requests for extensions, modifications of the deadlines and requirements.;N
Tell us your position with respect to whether you are going to seek to hold fast to the deadlines and the time requirements laid out in the bill?;N
The first is key, and a lot of us are concerned about is on January 18th there is a requirement that all checked bags be screened.;N
This deadline is, the stipulation is that these systems have to be deployed and used throughout the Nation by December 31st, 2002.;N
Do you have any questions about whether that deadline to make sure that bags are checked as relates to explosives would be met?;N
As you know, under the statute you are going to be responsible for training and deploying additional Federal air marshals.;N
How fast do you think that this country can get where you want us to be on the air marshal issue?;N
I have a couple of questions, but I wanted to follow up on the train of thought of air marshals, and ask if you would look at the age deadline.;N
You mentioned that you have a number of applications, most with law enforcement experience, which I think is terrific because you will not have to do training from scratch.;N
It is also my hope that in the future, you could have air marshals come from your own system, perhaps people who start as screeners.;N
Hopefully, you could attract a better quality of person to go into the entry level knowing there is going to be something beyond that, such as supervisory capabilities and then air marshals.;N
However, there is an age limit of 35, I think, in the bill for the air marshal position, with an exemption for retired law enforcement and military with certain number of years.;N
Do you think that is enough of an exemption, because there would be many people, I am sure, at the age of 40 or 45 who could do a great job as an air marshal?;N
Well, I appreciate that and I hope you will keep in mind that I am certainly willing to change the law if we need it on the 35 age.;N
I agree totally with your concept, which has been my concept, that if you can bring people in at the ground level with screening and establish a career track, that would probably be the best if you have enough available people.;N
Let me just ask you, though, if you have the screening job, which is even, I think, more prone to burnout, could you also assess how the best way to do this at some rotation and some use of personnel--for instance, if a person is an air marshal and flies a round trip and has only worked maybe 4 or 5 hours, maybe rotating them into supervisory jobs or screening jobs, just to break up the day, and have the screeners then be able to do something else.;N
I am not even asking you to comment on that right now, but to look at that as you are deciding how it is best to keep the screeners sharp and the air marshals sharp during a day where you are doing the same thing.;N
One of the big sticking points in the bill as we were writing it was whether we had enough capability to fire on the spot someone who was letting down on the job, especially in the screening position.;N
Do you think the bill gives you the flexibility to fire at will, and do you think that the treatment of these screeners as security personnel, and therefore putting them in a different category from civil service personnel, was done correctly in the bill?;N
Let me just say that we knew when we passed this very comprehensive piece of legislation that there might be a need for some fine-tuning after we were up and running.;N
I hope that you will come to us after you have been in office for 9 months or so and tell us where you need the technical corrections that would give you the ability to do your job better.;N
You have said in response to a question I asked earlier that you are going to hold fast to the deadlines and timetables in the Airline Security Act.;N
I am obviously, and I think my colleagues are, looking for dogged determination on that point.;N
I am going to ask some additional questions with respect to some of the deadlines and timetables and parts of the Act.;N
But Senator Specter is under a very tight timeline and managing a bill on the floor, so I am going to recognize him at this time.;N
I am the manager for the Republicans on the conference report of the appropriation bill on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, so I appreciate your courtesy in permitting me to question at this time.;N
Mr. Magaw, you accurately state that it was not your watch in 1992 when this happened, Randy Weaver, just as it was not on Director Freeh's watch of the FBI.;N
Now, I am on the Appropriations Committee and was at the time you reference, but it was never called to my attention that you had made these changes.;N
When you have an oversight committee, obviously there is a lot of overlap in the Congress, and these were very extended hearings, lasted months.;N
If there is further documentation beyond the single sheet which you have given me or the couple of sheets with only one reference to Ruby Ridge, I would like to have it.;N
I do not know if the Committee will or not, but I want to be very diligent and very prompt in concluding my part of this matter, my evaluation as to your judgment.;N
I appreciated the last answer you gave, Mr. Magaw, but you did not quite come to grips with my question.;N
This was not your Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit in 1992, but you came in and, in the context of this what I considered egregious, reprehensible conduct, you said that it was ``proper in every respect.'';N
My question to you that I asked you before, that I repeat, is: Is it your judgment today that it was ``proper in every respect''?;N
I think that is very important to acknowledge, Mr. Magaw, because you are being considered for a very, very important position and there are a lot of people who are still concerned about what happened at Ruby Ridge.;N
I think it is very important that your judgment today is not that it was proper in every respect.;N
I do not have 40 years in law enforcement, but I have a fair sized record there myself, and there are tremendous problems about governmental misconduct and law enforcement misconduct.;N
This is something that I faced day in and day out in the turbulent decade of the 1960s and 1970s when I was the district attorney of Philadelphia.;N
Where you have recurrent activities, but where you have the FBI, which is the model of law enforcement, it seems to me very important as a signal to every law enforcement officer in America who uses deadly force that that concession be made, and where you had the activities of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is not as well known obviously as the FBI, but a very important agency, highly respected and looked to.;N
When you talk about the funding, I wrote the Armed Career Criminal bill which was passed in 1984, which provides for life sentences for career criminals who are caught carrying firearms.;N
ATF was funded at a very low level, but Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had the responsibility for enforcing the Armed Career Criminal bill.;N
Again and again, the Congress has sought to actually get these rules implemented, get them in place.;N
You have basically told us today that you are going to stand up to them, that you are going to make sure that this law is adhered to.;N
Now let me ask you some more about the deadlines with respect to some of these provisions that are so important.;N
The Act stipulates that the deadline for deployment of Federal screening personnel at all airports is 1 year from enactment.;N
Under the statute, you are responsible for establishing procedures for security screening of people providing ground services for airlines, such as catering, and supplies they put on board.;N
How long do you expect that this is going to take and how do you plan to pursue implementing that?;N
Well, when you say that there needs to be clearer oversight--because that seems to me to be a real vulnerability.;N
Now, the statute sets a deadline of 90 days after enactment to implement an aviation security program for charter air carriers with large aircraft.;N
Now, you told me that you are going to stick closely to the timetables and deadlines in the statute.;N
But there are places where the Act gives you some authority to provide waivers or extensions.;N
Can you pledge today that you are going to use those provisions sparingly and only as a last resort?;N
On the discretion point, you do have considerable discretion in areas such as promoting enhanced security measures.;N
Could you tell us how you plan to use your discretion in that area and, given the fact that you do have some discretion in some of these areas, what would be your priorities with respect to those powers granted you?;N
We would like to know your view on how technology can help promote aviation security as well.;N
You know, the statute contains a number of provisions on research and development with respect to technology.;N
The evidence is very clear that the people who threaten this country are not technological simpletons.;N
I think it was the view of the sponsors of those provisions that we would find ways to incorporate new technologies in order to get out in front of those who threaten this country's security.;N
Tell us your view of the role that technology can play in aviation security and particularly how you are going to get from the private sector state-of-the-art products and innovations in order to promote security at our airports?;N
So you are willing to be the point person as it relates to technology that can promote aviation security?;N
Because I know many companies constantly contact myself and other members of this Committee with ideas and suggestions.;N
But there is a great deal of concern among the rural airports of this country that they are not going to have the money to get the job done, and we want to make sure that citizens in more rural areas continue to have air service and, of course, that they are secure at the same time.;N
How do you intend to work with the rural communities across this country to help them deal with the new security issues?;N
I think the fact of the matter is, even though progress has been made in recent months, there are significant vulnerabilities with respect to airline security today.;N
There are a lot of agencies where people can take a bit of extra time to get settled in, but it has been noted that a year from now you have really got to have in place a long enforcement operation that I think from a simple numbers standpoint is bigger than the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency combined.;N
I think you know that this Committee, Senators on both sides of the aisle, are going to watch your office and the implementation of this law very, very closely.;N
"I can tell you, having studied the record of the last 15 years and looking specifically at the pattern, which is always the same--there is a horrible tragedy, that is the first thing that happens; huge public outcry; the Congress moves, there are recommendations made on airline security; and then again and again and again, there is slow motion implementation and it all gets whittled down and watered down and very often becomes a lawyers' full employment program as there is this huge fight in various agencies.";N
Senators of both political parties, led by Senators Rockefeller and Hutchison, are going to insist on it.;N
When you told me that you were going to adhere to those timetables and that you would seek to use very sparingly any possibility of deviating from those timetables, that was what I wanted to hear.;N
I will tell you, I came in today wanting to clarify your position on a number of these key issues with respect to deadlines.;N
Our papers, as you know, are filled every day with the lobbying efforts of some to try to water those deadlines down.;N
You have told us that you are not going to give in to those efforts, the efforts to implore you to make changes, and I appreciate that.;N
I will have an opening statement, but first I would like to recognize our friend and colleague from Alaska.;N
I am going to be opening the floor soon with my amendment, but I come to welcome to the Committee once again a former Chief of Staff of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, former Secretary of Navy, currently at the OMB and other times Professor at Syracuse University.;D
Sean O'Keefe is a man of great honor, great talent, great ability and he is the right man for NASA at this time.;D
I am delighted to have an opportunity to be here and recommend him to the Committee for quick confirmation.;N
Well, I thank my colleague and it is a plus for this Committee that Senator Stevens and Mr. O'Keefe go way back.;N
This morning, the Committee is going to consider the nomination of Deputy Director Sean O'Keefe of the Office of Management and Budget, to be the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;N
NASA is charged to undertake research regarding flight activities in aeronautics and space.;N
The Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, which I chair, has oversight responsibility of NASA.;N
NASA, with a budget of over $15 billion, is the largest program within the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.;N
Mr. O'Keefe's watch will begin during the period of exceptionally tough choices for our Nation's space program.;N
Costs for the horrendously mismanaged Space Station have shot out of control while its capabilities have shrunk.;N
Unless Mr. O'Keefe can get the International Space Station program back in the box--and quickly--the Space Station will use not only allotted resources, but will devour the dollars needed for NASA's other high-priority missions.;N
Mr. O'Keefe's principal challenge will be to refocus the agency and existing Federal funds for carrying out NASA's original goals--research, development, and scientific exploration of space.;N
Specifically, I want Mr. O'Keefe to return NASA to a science and research driven agenda so that our dedicated scientists and engineers can find the breakthrough technologies that have been NASA at its best.;N
I am not interested in Mr. O'Keefe coming in and being a fiscal watchdog to narrow NASA's scope, but so NASA can enlarge its scientific visions.;N
The chief value of sound financial management is to ensure the agency has the resources to fulfill its mission.;N
As chair of this subcommittee, I intend to work closely with my colleagues from Congress, those in the Administration with the country's science leadership and find a way to make this crucial transition.;N
As Mr. O'Keefe begins to return NASA's resources to its origins, I believe that safety must continue to be the No. 1 priority.;N
I also believe that ensuring safety, shortening timelines, and introducing new technologies do not have to be mutually exclusive.;N
You cannot convince me that NASA doesn't have the talent to come up with new ways of doing things that are also smarter ways of doing things.;N
Where there are dollars spent on layers of bureaucracy or other areas, the fat is not protective padding.;N
For example, with respect to the International Space Station, in 1993 when the current design was adopted, NASA said the Space Station would cost $17.4 billion for construction, no more than $2.1 billion per year.;N
Earlier this year, NASA admitted the cost of completing the Space Station had grown to roughly $30 billion, almost $5 billion above cost caps imposed by the Congress.;N
The station is being redesigned and dubbed U.S. core complete, but it is far from the complete scientific platform originally envisioned.;N
NASA scrapped plans for the crew return vehicle, application module and the propulsion module.;N
Even with those cutbacks, NASA will still have to find ways to make management more efficient and do a better job of estimating costs before an even scaled-back version of the program.;N
NASA also faces the difficult challenge of funding necessary upgrades to the fleet of Space Shuttles.;N
These upgrades have become increasingly important as the life expectancy of the Space Shuttle has been stunted.;N
Mr. O'Keefe is going to be faced with tough choices that are certainly not going to always be possible, but it is essential that he choose well.;N
It is not simply that NASA produces the technology to drive our Nation's economy from aerospace and electronics.;N
Continuing on the current path will surely bind NASA to Earth and its mission along with it.;N
Mr. O'Keefe's nomination comes at an important juncture for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;N
I appreciate your willingness to work with myself and others on the Committee to give consideration to this important nomination in a very timely fashion.;D
As we all know, Mr. O'Keefe is currently the Deputy Director of OMB and he has a history of taking on major challenges.;D
He took over as Secretary of the Navy at a very demanding and stressful time for that branch of our services.;D
When I was the Chairman of this Committee, I was amazed as much as anyone by the many reports on management problems at the agency.;N
Based upon its interface with the Commerce Committee, I say there is, unfortunately, some truth to it.;N
I have written to the agency about incomplete and inaccurate information provided to the Committee.;N
The important point to be realized today is for NASA to understand that accurate and complete information is critical for the Congress to be able to develop effective legislation.;N
The recent Young Report, which I hope all Members of the Committee will read, has highlighted several management issues on the most visible program at NASA, the International Space Station.;N
Existing deficiencies in management structure, institutional culture, cost estimating, and program control must be acknowledged and corrected in order for the program to move forward.;N
Cost estimates for the U.S.-funded enhancements are not sufficiently developed to assess credibility, and there are opportunities to maximize research on the core station program with modest cost impact.;N
Based on this Committee's work over the past years, I feel that many of these findings would also be applicable to many other programs at NASA.;N
I believe that we, the Congress, and the Administration, need to make a conscientious decision on the future of the Space Station.;N
I am willing to work with you and other Members of the Committee and the Administration to develop a plan within the next 120 days for the future of the Station.;N
The choice is whether we want to continue spending $100 billion of taxpayer funds and receive 20 hours per week of research in return, or do we want to invest additional funds and get a more functional research facility in return.;N
Space science, earth science, space transportation and aeronautics are all important to NASA, as well as the Nation.;N
After the events of September 11th, the Nation is in need of immediate advancements in the aeronautical science arena.;N
I know the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee is considering additional hearings in this area, and I applaud them for doing so.;N
I look forward to working with this outstanding nominee to define and refine the agency's vision, however, we also know that vision without a strategy is just an illusion.;N
Again, I look forward to working with the nominee to develop the appropriate strategy for this provision.;N
In light of the problems and concerns I have just mentioned and many others, I feel that Mr. O'Keefe makes an excellent nominee as an excellent Administrator of NASA.;D
I think he has the right skills and capabilities at the right time to fully restore the meaning of NASA.;N
I think, as some have suggested, NASA faces some very unique challenges at this moment, and Mr. O'Keefe's particular talent fits well with the opportunity to meet those challenges.;D
But let me say despite all of these issues that have been raised, and I think they are appropriately raised, I deeply admire the men and women of NASA who are America's finest explorers of our universe.;N
I have long believed that a society that stops exploring is a society that stops progressing.;N
This is an important and exciting set of missions on behalf of our country, and I believe all of us want success for NASA, so Mr. O'Keefe is offered to us by President Bush as his nominee.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you and Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain for having this hearing early.;N
I have to say, I have reservations, not because of anything particular with you, but because I am concerned about the OMB actions toward NASA, since the first of this year.;N
I think OMB has focused on budget cutting and I don't think the leader of NASA can be just a budget cutter.;N
I think the leader of NASA must change the problems at NASA which are budget related, but they are leadership related as well, and we have been in limbo for too long, and I want to have a firm leader.;N
For that reason, I am going to ask for confirmation before we leave in December so that you can take firm control and hopefully prove that you have a vision for NASA that will be a long-term vision.;N
Most particularly, Mr. O'Keefe and I discussed the Young Report, and Mr. O'Keefe suggested that this would be the backbone of his beginning to grapple with the problems at NASA.;N
In the Young Report, I thought the most important red flag was the issue of the core complete 3-person crew that would be in the Space Station, and whether that would be a permanent situation or whether the goal would be to achieve core complete 3-person crew and then move beyond that to the 7-person crew.;N
It is said in the Young Report, and confirmed by others that I consulted, that it takes about 2\1/2\ crew members just to operate the Space Station, thus leaving only half a person worth of man hours to conduct research.;N
If we expend all of the station efforts on operating the station, I think we will lose the forest among the trees.;N
We will lose the big picture and we will lose what is uniquely NASA's mission, which is to go beyond operating and have the capability to do the innovative research that only the Space Station can do, such as with the microgravity conditions.;N
So I would like to ask Mr. O'Keefe if he is committed to moving beyond core complete into the capability to have more scientists be able to conduct the research.;N
In spirit with our international partners, we should seek to learn enough that is new and creative in the medical field, as well as the scientific field, that we will all be able to then create the industries and the improvements in quality of life that that research will bring.;N
I don't think you can precisely budget a war, and I don't think you can precisely budget innovative research.;N
You are going to have miscalculations, you are going to learn from those and create your final product.;N
So I am going to hope that there is more than a budget cutting mentality and a vision along with a common sense budget mentality.;N
I believe that he believes, along with Vice President Cheney, that NASA is one of the economic engines of America.;N
It is what has given us the leadership in the world for creative and very valuable satellite information and quality of life improvements, and I think we can do more if you have the capability to produce the vision that will assure we stay in the forefront.;N
I think the Young Report is quite sound, and if you can create the infrastructure that will allow us to go forward with that vision, then NASA will get its feet back on the ground and we will have the same kind of creativity and spirit at NASA that has inspired the American people to be supportive and has created a basis for new scientists and an inspiration to the young people of our country that science is a very important component of entrepreneurship and creativity in our country.;N
I hope that we can give him the opportunity to be the leader at a very early chance, and I think before we leave, we should confirm this nominee so that he can take the next 2 months when we are not in session to put his team together and begin to offer us the plans that would show that there is a new day and a new vision and a new spirit for NASA.;N
Here's how we are going to proceed at this point, because we have a vote on the floor of the Senate.;N
We have the distinguished Minority leader here with us, Senator Lott and his schedule is very tight.;D
When we return, we will recognize Senator Nelson, who was here next, and then Senator Allen and Senator Burns.;N
I just wanted to be here and congratulate Sean O'Keefe on being nominated for NASA Administrator.;N
I think NASA has an important role for our country, but I think NASA has been wandering around for the last several years without a real vision for the future without the type of leadership really needed and frankly, in many instances, in certain programs without sufficient money to do the job properly.;N
Then in other areas, Congress has forced money on NASA for programs that probably are not of sufficient value.;N
So I hope that your experience at the Department of Management and Budget, and your knowledge of Congress will help you in trying to get NASA headed in the right direction.;D
I have felt like in recent years that commitments were made by NASA that weren't kept, and that particularly unnerves me when I have the feel that the leadership of an agency is not being square with you or honest with you.;N
And I hope that as certain people have said why you need budget responsibility and your strengths, that you are not going there to just phase it out or phase it down.;N
If you are going to NASA just for a BRACC type arrangement, you are going to meet a lot of resistance from a lot of us here in this room.;N
I personally have been supportive of NASA over the years and disappointed at various times, but it is doing a lot of innovative things.;N
Vehicle manufacturing has a lot of potential that will be useful for NASA, but also in the commercial area.;N
One area that I am particularly interested in is the Landsat data continuity mission, which I think will yield a lot of that, and it will be useful in the private sector.;N
Once again, it looks to me like NASA is moving toward NASA owning a single satellite and minimizing the value of this program, as opposed to using the commercial, the private area to get the maximum bang for the buck and to make sure that there is competition and that this is not just a government-run program.;N
For years, I have urged NASA, by the way, to get the information you have, the technology you get, the science that you benefit from into the private sector, and that has not been easy.;N
Are you committed to that type approach, as opposed to just a government-run and operated program?;N
I am going to break for 10 minutes and as you can see, we are going to have a vigorous debate this morning and we will start with Mr. Boehlert when we return.;N
Congressman Boehlert, it is getting to be a regular occasion that you are coming, as you were here yesterday and your testimony was eloquent then.;N
Senator Nelson, I am in awe of your passion for this, but I also know from which it comes.;N
I have a higher opinion of the tenure of Dan Goldin, because he has done some things that allowed us to build a very positive support base in every community across this country.;D
We talk about the value of pushing the envelope, and doing those things that we can do now.;N
But we also, we tend to forget about the work that was done to broaden the support of NASA, because no other single entity that this government does so stimulates the curiosity of young people, and edges them toward the sciences and the mathematics and the physics that it is going to take to survive in this world in the days ahead.;N
Take into account the financial constraints and other limitations, I am very pleased with Mr. Goldin, although the public was quick to criticize NASA for failed missions, it was the successes and the advancements in the work with students that occurred with little fanfare that the media did not pick up.;N
But I would say to a Nation today that once we are lulled or numbed into a society that shrinks and does not push the envelope and continues to reach out and to explore the unknown, then we will be a shrinking society that will fade from the face of the earth.;N
150 NASA launches since 1952, and only 10 on record that I have said they were failed missions.;N
In my little State of Montana, 950,000 people, many of our State University researchers are working on NASA with several initiatives so far with very satisfactory results.;N
The University of Montana is a NASA partner on Earth observations systems or the OES program.;N
The university has promoted interests in science, engineering and technologies to all ages from the young to the elderly.;N
Montana State University and NASA officials recently participated in a conference on astrobiology.;N
How did we get here and evolve and what is the destiny of life on Earth and what it means to us were some of the questions they asked.;N
The Institute of Thermal Biology hosted a meeting with key researchers and NASA top management in an overview to finding the search for life in those environments.;N
Previously unknown life forms have been discovered in Yellowstone National Park under very, very difficult environments, and also in the gold mines of South Africa desert that has never received a drop of water.;N
So NASA's Earth sciences program is dedicated to transferring the knowledge that we know by looking down on Earth to the resources that can be utilized to our Nation's agriculture and food and fiber production, to our people who utilize our national renewable resources, our land planners, and our health organizations.;N
During the meeting I had with Mr. O'Keefe, and I will say speaking as a Scottsman, turning this over to an Irishman makes me a bit uncomfortable there, but I was very encouraged by his desire to reach out to students in educational institutions, and that is the key to the NASA success.;N
They stuck it in a safe away from the rest of the world and especially to their own people.;N
Where NASA took the technology that we developed and set up technology transfer centers and got it out into the public sector where every one of us in this room, we drive automobiles, our new composites, our computer systems was a result of that technology transfer.;N
We continue to grow and to lead the world with not only this agency, but also all of America in various ways.;N
But it is like Senator Nelson said, this is a spirit of America, and we are going to have failures, because we are dealing with pushing the envelope, and like I said, nobody has to sell me on the merits of this program, because I am a disciple.;N
But I think that we have to have a vision to dream and we have to make sure that this continues for my children and grandchildren and generations to come that will prosper in this great country and the spirit that it has.;N
But I really believe this is one of the most important appointments that this Administration will make and it is one of the most important missions that this Committee has under its jurisdiction in its support of the future.;N
I thank you for holding this hearing and I want to associate myself with the remarks that you made at the outset of this hearing, as well as those of Senator McCain, Senator Hutchison, and I did not hear Senator Nelson, but Senator Burns hit the nail right on the head.;N
I look forward to listening to your vision, your views as to where NASA needs to go and to the future and also working with you in the future.;N
In terms of leadership in the scientific community, NASA is just one of the very top in the entire world, not just this country, but all over the world.;N
In its scientific research that has direct benefits clearly to our national security and national defense, but also to our economy, and tangibly over the years, has improved the lives of Americans and people all over the world.;N
It is important to look at past record and where it can be improved, but what I am most interested in is really what was alluded to by Senator Hutchison and Senator Burns, and that is the core guiding principles that will mark your leadership.;N
No. 1, it should be continued scientific excellence for the competitive leadership of America in aeronautics and space, and the second principle should be, of course, fiscal responsibility with the taxpayers' dollars.;N
Now, from what I have read in the newspapers and discern through answers that you have had, Mr. O'Keefe, to the Committee questionnaires, I see that these objectives seem to be your objectives.;N
That is scientific excellence that we need to focus on, because it is an important responsibility of NASA.;N
Back when I was Chairman of the subcommittee, before Senator Wyden was Chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, back in April, we held a hearing on aeronautics in our country.;N
At the same time, we heard about a lack of attention given to the U.S. programs for advancements in this vital area of aeronautics.;N
The question is for all of us and you as Administrator, Mr. O'Keefe, what does the United States intend to do about this?;N
If we are going to respond to this challenge, which I think Americans would want us to do, when, and how?;N
related manufacturing as far as jobs in this country is the next exporter in our economy and so if we lose this preeminence, that means a loss of some outstanding jobs and capabilities here in our country.;N
A study by the National Research Council stated that the continued reductions in funding for aeronautics research and development may have irreversible consequences.;N
Back in the 1970s and 1980s, where our main competition may have been the Soviet Union, America was still alone at the top in the field of aeronautics research.;N
But since early 1990s, the U.S. position in this field has steadily declined and now the very existence of our U.S. entry in this field is being threatened by better funded European initiatives.;N
Once the United States loses this leadership position, it will be extremely difficult to regain that leadership role given the difficulty of reassembling the infrastructure, the scientists, the engineers, the highly skilled people in the investment capital that is needed.;N
I think in addition to this international challenge, we have a national challenge, Mr. O'Keefe, and that has to do with better security.;N
I think advancements in aeronautics can help with security as well as better transportation system through the skies and this is going to depend on new technologies, the need is both short-term and long-term.;N
We need to pursue both evolutionary and revolutionary advances, but the key to it is clearly human capital.;N
We need to make sure that more and more youngsters or younger people are studying in our colleges and universities.;N
The age of those who are in the aeronautics field are older people, more likely to retire.;N
We have to reverse this trend by first increasing our efforts at aeronautics research at NASA, as well as the private sector.;N
I was very pleased to read in one of the answers to your questionnaires that the use of colleges and universities in that effort and partnership, it doesn't need all to be NASA.;N
Our colleges and universities can help whatever the mission may be on that particular project, but also encourage youngsters or people who are being educated to get an education in aeronautics.;N
We must inspire to improve the lives of people in the future and innovate, as well as make sure our economy is strong and make sure we have security in our skies.;N
I and others have said we are not looking for sound financial management as an end in itself.;N
It is really the underpinning for NASA to use the existing Federal funds to get back to its original goals: research and scientific exploration of space.;N
So we would very much like to see you lay out your scientific vision for NASA, and particularly with regard to the agency's science and exploration goals.;N
Your predecessor, Mr. Goldin, was at NASA for nearly 10 years and led the call for what was known as the faster, better, cheaper approach at NASA.;N
Mr. O'Keefe, I would very much like the final answer that you were giving to the Chairman here.;N
The efforts of NASA, in particular in aeronautics, has always been for NASA to be involved in some of these high-risk research ventures.;N
Some of those that the private sector could never do, but in collaboration with the government, it is very important.;N
And let me first ask you, do you consider aeronautics research still a core function of NASA?;N
Do you believe that investment in aeronautics in the future, you are talking about entrepreneurial spirit, do you think that investments in that research will produce positive results for our country and aeronautics generally?;N
Now, during this period of declining funding for NASA, and I have mentioned this in my opening statement, our European competitors, as well as the Japanese, have been increasing their aeronautics research and development funding, and the European Commissions announced a new plan to significantly further increase their government funding for aeronautical research.;N
They have estimated funding, public and private that could exceed $100 billion U.S. dollars over the next 2 decades.;N
In spite of this, there have been proposed significant reductions in NASA's aeronautical research budget in fiscal year 2002.;N
Now, I know this is argumentative question, but I want to hear what your principles are, but do you believe that it is in our best interests as a Nation to allow our aeronautical and aviation capabilities to wither in the face of this competition, or if you say that we can have a huge positive impact in the future, how do we turn that around and face that competition?;N
The NASA aeronautical research centers work closely with FAA and policies affecting flight safety or the airline system capacity which everyone on this Committee knows has to be done and it is a wonderment that everyone knows it needs to be done.;N
Do you see NASA expanding in these particular collaborative partnerships with other government agencies.;N
What I would like to do today is to expand that discussion, and there will be some repetition, because I would like to get it as part of the record, but I would like to give you an opportunity for expanding and expounding your ideas.;N
I too think that one of the great public servants, particularly in the aerospace field, has been Tom Young.;N
There are troubling parts to me of Young, one of which we discussed yesterday, that because of NASA's financial situation that you would possibly lower the number of annual launches of the Space Shuttle to four.;N
That has some enormous consequences, because if we suddenly then had to robustly increase and a lot of all of this expertise had been laid off in the process, then in having to rehire, you lose a lot of that corporate memory that has been so valuable to NASA, why do not you comment on that?;N
This is just a beginning, so whenever you want me to stop and pass it on, I am just going to continue as you will permit.;N
Let me, before we send it on to Senator Burns, say that the Young Commission report in and of itself is a good document.;N
But when you put it into the context that NASA has been a bad boy, and that NASA must be punished, and so that we are going to find a way to redirect funds within NASA, that is when I start to get concerned.;N
Now, no less a space giant than Chris Kraft has written a letter, an open letter concerning the recent report of the task force chaired by Tom Young.;N
He says: ``First it is difficult to perceive that such a formidable group''--talking about the Young Commission--``would present such a narrow view.;N
You would think that many members of the task force knew the past history of NASA Space Station activity and given that premise had to realize that today's financial status was almost preordained.;N
``The overruns--or more poignantly, the total cost of the ISS--resulted from a continuous change in direction of the program which was beyond the control of those who were required to build the Space Station.'';N
He continues, ``if you take into account the sordid history of the Space Station, you will find that the people in NASA who were saddled with making a program work which was almost unmanageable in the first place, have done a miraculous job to bring the program to the point it is at today for the money that they had to do it with.;N
``As usual, the working level people get blamed for the horrible mess created by the people who did not have to do the job.'';N
And he concludes, ``the Space Station has been through at least five different phases since its inception.;N
To then take that sordid history of which has produced some remarkable technology that has been a symbol with remarkable adaptability to make it work, and it is.;N
I want us to get that corrected, but I do not want to use that as an excuse to punish NASA, to penalize the people, to knock the Space Shuttle program down to almost nothing, and then not have a talented capable workforce that when we need to surge in the future, and thereby a time to surge in the future, then all of that base is gone.;N
Mr. O'Keefe, there are two areas of which I am specifically interested, probably three areas.;N
It has been a launchpad for many smaller universities and colleges in their research and R&D work that has allowed them to participate in the national agenda of NASA, and some good things have come from that by the way that they weren't all found at MITs and this type thing.;N
I think it is one of those ongoing things that we have to strive for a little imagination for the entrepreneurial community and how they can participate in this and derive benefits from it that benefit us all, and then I think when we look at the infrastructure and our mission ahead and into the vision of things and dealing with dollars to complete those missions, I think we shouldn't shortchange the work that has been done and the work yet to do on unmanned reusables.;N
We are talking about the Shuttle and the orbiter that we have now that is getting along in years, no doubt about it.;N
Going to have to be some thought for the future there, but some of these trips could be made by unmanned reusables at a cost savings.;N
And I think we should continue to explore the challenges that we have in developing a single launch, a vehicle, in other words.;N
It is just a vehicle that can get into orbit and deliver the goods and then come back to earth without a pilot, to move some of the material that we are going to have to move in space.;N
If there is one thing that we have in this government right now that we have 2 or 3 agencies that are doing the same thing.;N
Redundancy does not serve us well, and when we start talking about a limited amount of funds that we have to use.;N
Some of the work that is being done at NASA is also being done in the FAA, and other areas, and I think it is time to take a look on how we can bring those programs together and maybe streamline that and not have the redundancy that seems like it occurs.;N
I am always struck by the work that goes on at NIH, and I am also struck by the amount of money that we spend in the Veterans Administration to do some of the things that NIH does, and I do not know why everybody has to have their own turf or whatever in R&D.;N
Not to diminish the job that the previous director did, because I think he has done a lot of things in unseen places that was of little notice, but had high impact as far as the support of what we do in space.;N
We know that it is going to be a long time before everything that we do and all the benefits is realized by the society that pays the bills, but nonetheless, I think right now, NASA doesn't owe this society a lot right now.;N
I think we have profited in many, many ways that are untold and they are not the sexy above-the-fold type issues.;N
So those are the areas that I continue to be very much interested in, and I think the reusables is just one of those areas where we have to take a very serious look at that and how we maneuver and how we will move materiel in space to complete the infrastructure for the mission that is ahead.;N
I will support you wholeheartedly and I am sure we will have discussions and conversations in the future, and a very pleasant holiday to you and your family.;N
There have been three inventions that have completely changed our lives, and it changed the way we think and the way we do business.;N
And those three inventions were the silicon chip, before that, think what the invention of the transistor has done.;N
It has been absolutely revolutionary as far as electronics are concerned, and of course, the jet engine.;N
I got a big kick of sitting next to a guy on an airplane and we were 5 minutes late getting into Minneapolis and the only thing he could do is complain about being late and here we are whipping through the air at 550 miles an hour and he is worried about 5 minutes.;N
I apologize for having to leave, but I wanted to return, because I wanted to ask you to address the issue of the 3-member crew as a long-;N
term permanent goal, or is your long-term permanent goal to increase the number in the crew so that we can do the research and how you plan to make the changes that would allow that to happen if it is your goal.;N
I am reminded of an old series called ``Yes, Minister,'' that was on BBC, and one of the series was about a wonderful new hospital and the Prime Minister visited the hospital and he was shown around and this new hospital had all of the state-of-the-art equipment and it was a fabulous hospital.;N
Now, when I am talking to you about NASA, and all the money in the Shuttle program and 3-member crew at the station, 2\1/2\ of whom are necessary to do the running of the station, I am left with the feeling that we are going to have an operation that is there to service the operation.;N
And that we could lose sight of the purpose of all of this, which is science and the research.;N
So tell me that you are committed to making sure that we do not get into a situation where patients are just an extraneous luxury.;N
If I could just say, I think you have gotten the message from everyone that I have heard speak this morning that we are looking to you to be the person who has the capability to implement a program that assures that the science and technology and experimentation is preserved and enhanced for NASA.;N
I know all of us are going to be vitally interested in this, because we believe that NASA is a premiere success story for America, and it is the place where our new scientists have a capability to create.;N
We are going to have a number of additional rounds, because of the interest of my colleagues.;N
The Senator from Florida asked if he could ask a question then we will go back to the regular order.;N
As a follow-up to the Senator from Texas, and again my hat is off to you for offering yourself to public service in this capacity, because it is a very tough assignment.;D
And the fact that you have a personal relationship with the Vice President is considerably to your advantage, as well as to the advantage of NASA.;D
But I want to follow up Senator Hutchison's question, because the answer that you gave did not sound like the answer that you gave on November 7th to the House Science Committee, in which you said that you did not favor a 10 to 15 percent increase in ISS funding to enable a 7 person crew until the cost considered as read credibility is regained.;N
Yet you agree that you want an increased level of scientific productivity that could be accomplished later in the decade.;D
I do not see how if you keep a 3 person crew today, and that will stay with us at least through 2006, how that is not going to severely limit--as Senator Hutchison has suggested, for the immediate future--that is another 4 years, the scientific activity on the station.;N
Then once you regain the cost credibility that you are looking for, then it is going to take another 4-5 years to develop a 7-person crew return vehicle, and so the concern that I have as a follow-up is doesn't that push us off until about 2010 in order to get any significant science up there on the Space Station?;N
I think we want to have multiple rounds of questions and have a chance to pursue this with each Senator getting 5 minutes.;N
If you want to ask one additional question at this point, then we will go back to the regular order.;N
I will do it however you want, but I do not want to break a train of thought, Mr. Chairman.;N
So my question was what do you think about the 3-man crew and how can you do the science and when do you want to change that 3-man crew?;N
For this round I am going to ask one question about the Space Station, core complete design eliminates habitation model and crew rescue vehicle making our astronauts dependent on Russian partners for critical needs.;N
How can NASA effectively manage its work on the Space Station given dependence on international partners?;N
When you are confirmed, and I am going to assure there is a rapid confirmation, when will you go to NASA and assume your administrative duties?;N
There is a great deal of speculation that when you are confirmed, you go through another budget round, people concerned about cuts will say ``he is going to slash us then go on down.'';N
These ones that I specifically mentioned are far ahead of where they are at this moment and we are going to have to find ways for them to upgrade.;N
Obviously some of those decisions by the commercial sector will be determined by their own bottom lines and what they can do to upgrade their own systems and how it makes a difference in their bottom line as far as more passengers or greater safety for their planes.;N
I just wanted to conclude, Mr. O'Keefe by saying I have enjoyed listening to you and hearing your ideas.;N
I think the best thing that I have learned from this hearing which you cannot read from answering questionnaires or reading articles, is that you have a sense of humor.;N
I always think it is important for people to have common sense and that they keep their promises, but it is also important in addition to having thick skin and a sense of humor.;N
All that does is create uncertainty amongst this dedicated group we have across the country.;N
The Chairman pointed out that that is our lifeboat and we are relying on the Russian Soyuz today.;N
NASA has had plans for its own rescue vehicle which would require us going beyond core complete, and I want to ask you how important a priority it is for you to determine how safe it is and, to rely on the Russian Soyuz and to determine if we need to move forward on our own crew rescue vehicle as a top priority?;N
But it will be a priority for you to get right to it, because if you determined that it needs to be a priority moved up, then you can put that in your budget submissions and, because it is important to me to know that you have looked at that and made the determination here to go forward with our own crew rescue vehicle or that Soyuz is safe for the time being.;N
I just wanted to follow up again on the Chairman's point and then I will let Senator Nelson go forward, because I appreciate his deference.;N
I wanted to clarify your answer to the Chairman on when you would take control of NASA once the Senate has confirmed you.;N
Did you say that it would be no longer than 1 month after confirmation that you would expect to be at the helm of NASA?;N
If the Senate acted before we leave next week and you have a well-deserved family vacation, then would it be your intention to immediately go to NASA and take control?;N
I want to follow up Senator Hutchison's questions about the lifeboat of the Soyuz, and there is some talk that in doing the delays on an American lifeboat that you might employ the Soyuz.;N
What about this report in the Orlando Sentinel that they are threatening to pull out, because of the propensity to scale back the lab.;N
They are obviously being put in a very difficult situation, so what is your thinking at this point about how we go about assuring our international partners that they will have the full utilization and at the same time to handle all in your management of cost?;N
This report is the latest reflection of considerable agitation among our international partners, of which there has been circulated in the NASA community a letter from the Canadian government, which is at least a month old, stating that the United States has breached its agreement.;N
How do you, other than conferring with Secretary Powell and Secretary Armitage, how do you go about solving a problem if you have not got room for them to get up there on the station unless, in fact, you move to develop the technology to allow to you have more than 3 on a station?;N
Since our role constitutionally is to advise before we consent, may I respectfully advise you that the two gentlemen that you mention happen to be two of the finest appointments in the Administration.;N
I have had the capacity as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to get to know them.;N
Of whether or not you are going to move to a position of whether you can have more than 3 and set a goal of when it is going to be and then work it out with your international partners.;N
And that is why I asked you the question about whether or not as an interim solution do you buy a second Soyuz and try to fix it some way up there where it is docked if you cannot spend the money to do the 7-man lifeboat.;N
One that I think we just need to be a bit clearer on is the research agenda and how it is going to be determined.;N
What are the processes, the structure that you are going to follow for making decisions about the research agenda, for example, who are you going to seek input from with respect to research.;N
We have touched on it throughout the morning, but I would like to come back to that and have you set out clearly how you are going to pursue this.;N
How would you go about striking the balance between human space flight and the other responsibilities at NASA?;N
I am not completely clear, either where you believe human biological science fits as part of the Space Station project either.;N
As you can see, he and I have a number of areas we want to explore, and I pledged that we wouldn't bring in the corn flakes for breakfast.;N
One additional that is been important to me is understanding how the Bush Administration is going to approach overall space policy from the military, civil and commercial side of this discussion.;N
The Administration has stated how important it views a space-based national missile defense, for example.;N
President Eisenhower's desire to separate military and civilian space activities led to the creation of the agency, but the Defense Department retaining control over military space programs.;N
Tell us, if you would, what is the Administration's overall space policy for military, civil, and commercial space and who in the Administration is going to go about coordinating these various areas?;N
Do you foresee the Administration, Mr. O'Keefe, formally issuing a new space policy, and if the answer is yes, I would be interested, for example, on how that would differ from the Clinton Administration?;N
Earlier, you said that you would consider as a result of the Young Report, the reduction of 4 flights a year.;N
This is a considerable concern, because it was at this very table that in September we had a hearing on Space Shuttle safety and unanimously all of the participants in the hearing, which included both inside and outside NASA, said if you are going to fly the Space Shuttle, we are going to fly it safely and that was the No. 1 priority.;N
What I'd like to know is before you would make such a decision, will you come and report specifically to Congress and seek our advice?;N
And in making such a decision, will external independent groups or NASA conduct an analysis on the impact?;N
I just want to express as part of our constitutional role of advising, if you look at this decision and the Young Report through the prism of a mindset of OMB, there is going to be considerable risk to the space program, because such a decision, for example, on reducing to four flights per year means that there would be a considerable layoff of the workforce, particularly at the Cape, at the Kennedy Space Center, the finest launch team in the world.;N
And such a financial decision to reduce the launches to 4 would mean a considerable layoff of that expertise and then when the time comes and it surely will, that we start to ramp up, you lose a lot of that ability, and you have seen that kind of hurky-jerky kind of approach in the past has not served us well.;N
So as Senator Hutchison says, if you start moving in that direction, not only will she be all over you, but I will too.;N
Because the bottom line is going to affect safety, and that is one of the most dangerous points of the whole Shuttle mission--;N
And if you will do Shuttle upgrades, they can move it up to 1-in-1,000, significantly increasing the safety factor, but you cannot do that if you start reducing your flight rate to 4.;N
One of the things that I think you ought to consider also in view of the war on terrorists is that you have to have this vehicle as reliable assured access to space to back up your expendables.;N
And you could go on through a number of the other expendables and their launch pads that have to be operable, and so if you are looking at assured access to space, there cannot be any mistakes with regard to the Space Shuttle.;N
We have begun to look at balancing the need for safety upgrades versus the various other needs.;N
I think it would be helpful to know what role you see Shuttle playing for future space transportation needs.;N
Let me turn now to the question of privatization, and particularly, privatizing the Shuttle.;N
You, as I understand it, are on record as supporting the further privatization of the Shuttle and other programs.;N
If the Shuttle is turned over to the private sector, how do you go about ensuring that NASA gets the things it needs at those prices?;N
It is our Subcommittee's understanding that China is going to send a manned craft in space before 2005, and preparation for a mission to the Moon is underway.;N
Well, so that as you would be trying to conclude that, let me put your initial consideration of this question of privatization in the context of what has happened in history.;N
And when Challenger exploded, we realized that the mistake was that we were trying to make it be too many things to too many people.;N
And thus the policy decision, and this was during the time of the Reagan Administration, was that the commercial payloads could best be launched on expendable booster rockets, and that you would save the Space Shuttle primarily where you did the human in the loop, thus the scientific experiments, space telescope, and therefore, on the manifest, any of those commercial payloads, they finished those, but they did not redo them.;N
What I am afraid of is that there is this preference for privatization that does not apply to a scientific vehicle, and so I raise again the question that you will have to consider in the future, which you say you cannot address now, does privatization mean a return to commercial vehicles?;N
And if you move to the so-called privatization, well, what about all the ground infrastructure?;N
There is a substantial amount of expense of all of that stuff that goes along the space program, some of which by the way we have been trying to address and some of these appropriations bills, you know, the VAB has panels peeling off of it, Lord help us if a hurricane comes through there.;N
We have gotten a lot of that corrosion that is going on down there in the Cape from years of salt spray and so forth.;N
How is a private company that is going to be incentivized to redo all of that under a contract that they have to operate under specific cost, so I want you to arch your eyebrow as you approach what the President has given you as marching orders when you are dealing with a research vehicle and a research program like this, you may not have gotten this through your lens at OMB.;N
I suspect that you would have gotten some of this from your experience as controller of DoD, and as Secretary of the Navy.;N
A recent press report, Mr. O'Keefe said, and I will just quote here: ``NASA also hopes to land two unmanned spacecraft on Mars, launch a number of Earth observing satellites and a new space telescope in the next couple of years.'';N
I am struck that as we look at the scientific possibilities, the excitement always come back to showing that you can liberate funds from areas that are either low priority or administratively inefficient, and that debate certainly starts with the Space Station, but there are a lot of other parts to it.;N
Perhaps what symbolizes it for me is when you came as Deputy Director of OMB, you told the House Appropriations Committee that there would be a cost overrun of $4 billion on the Space Station and then a few days after the hearing, NASA came back and said the figure was more than $800 million or more than that, and I assume actually would like to have you comment on, I assume that one of your top priorities is going to try to restore the credibility of NASA with respect to estimating these future cost questions.;N
Well, and clearly to make the case of additional funds, you are going to have to show that you are making better use of current dollars, given they are citing one inefficiency after another.;N
I think you have the potential to really be a man for the times and to show that by cutting some of the massive overhead and the inefficiency that you can help the agency reach the stars.;N
It is not close to what you are going to have as you try to make what I call the transition back to the agency's original mission.;N
I think that is what this is all about is to take out the original charter for a science and research-driven kind of mission and then as you have described it, go out to the Senators and scientists and various communities that are directly affected by this, and then bring to Congress an agenda that we can rally and promoting a kind of development to breakthrough technologies and historical scientific developments that are so important.;N
Before I turn this over to Senator Nelson, let me also recognize that we have had a terrific fellow come over from the NIST agency, Kevin Kimball.;D
He has just done a terrific job for the Subcommittee, particularly on getting us ready for today's hearing.;N
I think the Senator knows, I am going to work very closely with them and we are going to get on these issues and put the kind of focus on it that allows us to promote the kind of science that the Senator from Florida is advocating.;N
Not only would it have the affects of what I was talking about in all of the layoffs, but it would also have the affect of very likely moth-balling at least 1 of the 4 orbiters, and that is going backwards.;N
The Shuttle upgrades funding has been minimized, and under the present plan will no longer be funded after 2005 based on NASA's current plan to shelve the orbiter fleet by 2012, because in NASA's budget plan we have about $5 billion for this thing called space launch initiative, which is really a development now of technology, so tell us what you believe about this space launch initiative as it's currently planned and funded.;N
I fully appreciate the fact that you cannot come to the table knowledgeable about all of this.;N
But they still have $5 billion in the budget over the next several years to develop a technology and, because of that, they are still postponing a lot of the upgrades that will directly affect the safety of the Space Shuttle, so if we are not going to have a replacement vehicle by 2012, which we are not, we got to keep the present horse in good condition to get us where we need to get.;N
So as I suggested to you last night, one of the things that you may look at since this space launch initiative is more toward the development of technology, see if you can get the Department of Defense as a partner in sharing the cost of that, because it would directly affect the Department of Defense giving you a little more breathing room in the NASA budget to go on and keep doing the Space Shuttle safety upgrades, because we just cannot afford to lose that vehicle as a reliable assured access to space.;N
And then I would ask for you to consider, because this is much more technical stuff of RDT&E, research development testing and evaluation in NASA's hardware procurements.;N
Do you have any particular DoD experience, by the way, that might be applicable to your ideas about procurement reform at NASA?;N
Before we conclude the hearing, I'd like to give you an opportunity to lay out for the record what is your vision?;N
I am grateful that you are excited about it, and I would only conclude the hearing by saying that as part of that vision, that this one Senator's vision is that we are a Nation of explorers and adventurers, and we always had a frontier.;N
And if we ever abandon trying to challenge that frontier, we will become a second-rate Nation.;N
But we won't, because of little agencies like NASA that keep that vision alive to fulfill the character of the American people as adventurers and explorers.;N
We are in the Full Committee, this afternoon on the confirmation of two nominees submitted by the administration, Mr. Jeffrey Shane to be Associate Deputy Secretary, Mr. Emil Frankel to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation Policy at the Department of Transportation.;N
We are delighted to have some of our colleagues here to introduce our nominees and we will get right to their remarks and let them be excused after they make their comments.;N
Of course, our good friend Senator Dodd is here, and Chris, we welcome your introductory comments.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I suspect you will be seeing shortly come through the door my colleague as well, Senator Lieberman, who wants to be here as well on behalf of Emil, to express our support for this nominee.;N
You will see, Mr. Chairman, as you go and take a look at the background qualifications of Emil Frankel, that this is just a first-class nomination, and I want to commend the administration for reaching out to Emil to fill this position.;D
He served as our Commissioner of Transportation in Connecticut for about 4 or 5 years, back in the early 1990s, I might point out during those immediately after the passage of ISTEA, which, as we all know, around the country a transition period and very, very difficult, the first major federal legislation designed to encourage intermodal planning and multimodal operations, and he just did a fabulous job in our state as the Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Transportation.;D
Since then, he has been an adjunct professor at the University of Connecticut, a fellow at Harvard and Yale, a graduate of Wesleyan University, Harvard law degree, knows these issues, knows economic development issues.;D
You tie these together, you have really got in the person of this nominee a remarkable individual who will bring, I think, some wonderful observations, analysis to the office of Transportation Policy.;D
He served, as I said, as a very successful Commissioner in our state, and I think across the board in our delegation in Connecticut you will hear nothing but kudos about Emil Frankel.;D
Well, it is good to have you here, Senator Dodd, and it is good to have Mr. Frankel and your delegation supporting you.;N
You have two Democratic Senators who are strongly in support of you, and that is a good sign.;D
Next, if it is OK, because I think Joe had another engagement--Joe, do you want to go ahead and make comments now?;N
Junior colleagues always find a word, but we always start with an expression of respect for our senior colleague.;N
Very briefly, I am delighted to come before you today, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Emil Frankel.;N
He has served as a very able and highly respected Commissioner of Transportation for Connecticut for 4 years.;D
During those 4 years in Connecticut he oversaw 4,000 employees and a $1 billion annual budget, was responsible for construction, rehabilitation and management of a genuinely multimodal transportation system, and at the same time he was chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.;N
Since he has left the state, he has been involved as an advisor to the Massachusetts Transportation Authority.;D
I have searched his record, and wanting to create credibility before you, Mr. Chairman, having two Democrat Senators support him, I have looked for some Republican contact, because he served under a truly independent governor of the State of Connecticut but served as legislative assistant to Senator Javits.;D
Anyway, this is a very good and able person, and I am really thrilled that the President has put him before you for this Assistant Secretary of Transportation.;D
I noticed--I think I noticed--yes, I noticed that in the conflicts of interest in Mr. Frankel's testimony that Mr. Frankel has agreed to, if he is confirmed, to sell his stock in Enron Corporation.;N
We are going to move on and have Congressman Jim Oberstar--Jim, if you would come on up with Mr. Jeffrey Shane, and Mr. Frankel, go ahead and stay at the desk, and we will have both of our nominees at the table, and we will look forward to having Congressman Jim Oberstar's introductory comments for Mr. Jeffrey Shane.;N
I think you are certainly correct that Chairman Fritz Hollings deserves the lion's share of the credit.;D
year history of the Department of Transportation has a person been nominated for a position at DOT with better or more appropriate credentials than Jeff Shane, the only exception perhaps being the current Secretary, Norm Mineta.;D
I was present at the creation of the Department of Transportation in 1966 as administrative assistant to my predecessor, John Blotnick, who chaired the appropriate subcommittee at the request of President Johnson, managed the legislation that crafted the Department, and so I have had a long view of this issue, and those who have filled various positions.;D
Jeff Shane comes to this position with a sweep of intellect, with the personal and professional integrity, with more than three decades of extensive experience with the Department of State and Department of Transportation on international aviation and trade policy, with credentials that will enable him to take command of the duties of the office on which he is about to enter without breaking stride, with a clarity of purpose, with a clear understanding.;D
My experience with Jeff Shane extends back over a decade and a half to his service at both the State Department and DOT in the Reagan and George H. Bush administrations.;N
In my capacity as Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I found Jeff Shane always to be a model of intellectual probity, thoroughly knowledgeable on a wide range of issues on which he was called to act, informed, and consistently and a constantly vigilant, vigorous advocate for U.S. aviation interests, and a skillful, effective international negotiator.;D
He was the architect of our government's open skies policy, Mr. Chairman, to promote competition in our bilateral aviation agreements.;D
Under this policy, we achieved very significant competitive agreements that advanced the cause of U.S. aviation, turned our share in the most important international aviation markets from 40-60 American-foreign, or 30-70 to 70-30 and 60-40 in favor of the United States.;N
In the aftermath of the enactment of ISTEA, we were having a discussion about the significance of this legislation and he said, it is one of the most extraordinary, innovative transportation measures ever enacted.;N
It has had the exceptional benefit of causing Assistant Secretaries at the policy level in the Department to get together to share our thoughts, understand each other's mode of transportation better, to begin thinking and acting intermodally, something we have long needed to do.;N
Secretary Mineta has told me several times that he wants Jeff to upgrade the Department's Policy Office to create, as he put it, a world class think tank.;D
Well, I support those efforts, and in fact 2 years ago while Jeff was in the private sector he and Charlie Honicutt, who came to me and out of concern about the level of staffing at DOT--Honicutt also held the same position in the Clinton administration--to explore means of upgrading the aviation policy staff.;N
Normally, folks out in the private sector, they have left government, they forget about the public policy issues, but Jeff was concerned.;D
We met weekly to fashion ideas, approaches, strategies to get the funding necessary to buildup the staff, which in the demise of the CAB, when it was transferred over to DOT, was one time 300, is now well under 100, and half of those are at retirement age, and you do not have the critical expertise in the Department to analyze these multibillion dollar aviation trade deals that we are in the process of negotiating.;N
Jeff Shane is concerned about it, and wanted us to do the right thing, took an enormous amount of time to address this issue, and now he will have the opportunity to first-hand deal with it, with the support of the Secretary.;D
I can think of no one better qualified to attract new staff, to keep them and to inspire them., and in these post September 11 times, in the aftermath of enactment of this landmark aviation and transportation security law, DOT needs at the policy level a person with Jeff Shane's experience, intellectual capacity, honesty, openness to new ideas, and the energy to pursue and implement innovation.;D
His reentry into public service, Mr. Chairman, will produce better transportation policy decisions to the benefit of our nation's economy and to the benefit of the Department, and to the benefit of the American public generally.;D
You are truly the transportation guru of the House, and those remarks coming from you are very encouraging about your relationship with Mr. Shane and your knowledge of his background, and your support is very important.;D
It is clear that both of these nominees have bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats, and that has got to be a very positive indication about the job they are going to be able to do.;D
So Congressman, thank you for being with us, and you can go back and do something over there.;N
Mr. Shane, we will allow you to go first, if you would give your statement, and then we will follow with Mr. Frankel.;N
Thank you both very much, gentlemen, for being with us, and thanks for your commitment to come back.;D
I think good people for the right job is absolutely critical, and that means getting people with experience both in the private sector and in the public sector to serve.;D
The fact that they were doing it in the private sector and are willing to come back at great sacrifice as far as I am concerned is something that is very positive, and not negative at all.;N
I want to also express the fact that I am the only Senator here should not be considered as a bad sign for either of you.;N
Because of the fact that if you all were controversial, or were less than supported by this Committee, every Senator would be here trying to tear you apart.;N
The fact that I am doing this on behalf of the Chairman, by myself, indicates actually the strong support that you have from both sides of the Committee, so it should not be in any way seen as a slight, really as positive.;N
And that focus on policy development is across all different venues of transportation and not just aviation, but the big picture.;N
Let me hope that when you leave this position you will be able to look back and say, it was a better place than when I got there.;N
Let me talk a little bit about the concept, since it is a policy decision that you are in.;N
It has become increasingly, and perhaps now because of the economics of the situation we are in, more and more concerned that in order to have competition and free markets, you have to have competitors, that you cannot have competition without competitors, and more and more it seems to me that more and more we have less and less.;N
More and more we have fewer railroads, more and more we have fewer oil companies, more and more we have fewer airlines, more and more we have fewer and fewer telephone companies, and it is sort of something that is permeating throughout society.;N
There is a great deal of activity and consolidation and mergers and what-have-you, and if we end up with two railroads in this country, or two airlines in this country, how are we going to have real competition, and if you do not have competition, the alternative is, government regulates.;N
If we only have one railroad, we are going to regulate where they go, what they charge, and who they serve.;N
The same thing with, you name the industry, and so competition is an essential ingredient, and you must have competitors in order to have competition.;N
Can you just give me some of your philosophy about the things that are happening out there, and what your recommendations might be?;N
We have been in this area of trying to make sure that people who drive trucks that carry hazardous materials are qualified in order to do that, and Congress has been involved in the Patriot Act and requiring background checks to be performed on all commercial drivers, and there is a debate about who is going to do that, whether the industry is going to do it, or whether the government is going to do it, or whether we are going to have a combination of some form to be able to do it.;N
I suggested, maybe naively, but it seems like it made a lot of sense, that we now require background checks for the purchase of firearms in this country, and we get those background checks done in 24 hours so somebody can buy or not buy a hand gun, which I imagine is done through some type of a computer system.;N
I am just wondering, why can we not use that same type of computer information on people who have criminal records, and extract that information for the purpose of determining whether they should have a commercial license to be able to transport hazardous material.;N
Can you give me your thinking, and what your recommendations would be on how we are going to resolve the question on how we can as quickly and fairly as we can get criminal background checks on people that are applying for these licenses?;N
Well, I take it on that point that the administration is now of the opinion that that act is not necessary.;N
We had some technical corrections which I think they are saying it is not really necessary now, that I think some of us felt that it would be helpful to have it spelled out in legislation, and you need to take a look to see.;N
We are not trying to pass legislation just to pass it, but I think if it is needed, and it is necessary, we want you all to take a look at it.;N
Can either of you give some indication of what we can do as an administration and as a Congress concerning the financial status of Amtrak?;N
We have got the legislation requiring that they liquidate if they do not operate in the black.;N
I mean, what do we need to do to assure the traveling public who uses rail transportation as a means of moving around the country that we are going to invest in this system?;N
I mean, if you look at what--and we always hear the stories about what Japan and what Europe has done to emphasize rail as a transportation of people.;N
The systems are generally much better supported, and there is a lot reasons, because of geography and the size of the countries, of course, but I hesitate to think what would happen to the Northeast Corridor with aviation if we did not have Amtrak.;N
I support it, but what can you tell the Congress, and perhaps in general right now, that we need to be doing to reassure this country that we are going to have an Amtrak system that is going to be available?;N
Mr. Shane, as a policy forecaster, perhaps, in the Department can you share some thoughts on that?;N
I guess I have the conclusion that we ought to quit trying to make Amtrak operate at a profit.;N
Make them operate efficiently, but recognize that a transportation system in crowded corridors using the rail is in the national interest, and we are going to have to quit worrying about whether it can only exist if it makes a profit.;N
I think it is in the national interest to have that there, because it also helps other sectors, other transportation sectors immensely.;N
Do we have to recognize we are going to have to spend some money on it, or do we take the position that if they cannot make it, we will shut them down?;N
If your trains are running full, we will operate at a profit, and if you cannot operate at a profit, we do not need you, or you should not be there.;N
I am not trying to pin you down, but maybe if you could elaborate, I mean, just from a philosophy type of standpoint, do you think that Amtrak should only exist if it could make its way financially, or would you be put into the category that, let us say it is in the national interest, and you are going to have a financial commitment of some sort to assist it to provide the service?;N
I should know, but I do not think I do, but I would imagine that other countries that have successful rail transportation systems, they are probably not money- making operations, whether it is in Europe or in Asia or Japan.;N
I would imagine that those countries have a financial commitment to keep those passenger transportation systems in place of some sort.;N
If you make the decision that a rail transportation system is in the national interest and it cannot make a go of it financially so we are going to have to assist it and subsidize it, could you not say the same thing for the aviation industry?;N
I mean, there is not an airline out there right now, but maybe one, that is probably showing a profit, so eventually, when you do not show a profit, you cease to exist in a free market.;N
Therefore, an aviation system is in our national interest, so we are going to subsidize passengers on all of the airlines to make sure they do not go away, and then you can extrapolate that to everything that you think is in the national interest and move away from a free market society.;N
Well, I think if we do have some additional questions to both of you gentlemen, I think we will submit them and ask that you respond.;N
After that is completed, I would hope the Chairman would try to process this out of the Committee as quickly as possible and hope we can get it done perhaps before we leave, because the question is, nobody knows when we are going to leave.;N
I think you are uniquely qualified, and thank you for agreeing to serve, and with that, the hearing will be adjourned.;D
The Senate Commerce Committee is meeting today for a confirmation hearing to examine the qualifications of Mr. Harold Stratton, who has been nominated by the President to serve as Commissioner and Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.;N
I have a very brief statement, but I think perhaps even before I give the statement, I will call on my colleague, Senator Domenici, from the state of New Mexico, who is here to introduce the nominee.;N
Maybe it's just the weight of my body, but these seats that you sit us in are way too low.;N
And I've known Hal for a number of years, going back to the days that he served in the New Mexico House of Representatives and then as attorney general of the State of New Mexico.;D
And clearly, Mr. Chairman and Members, if you want somebody who is active, who will participate, who has a lot of energy, you've got the right person.;D
So from my standpoint, I think the President chose a person that is just right for the job.;D
I think he is ready to be the Chairman and provide the kind of leadership that is obviously missing and necessary in this consumer-oriented institution of our national government.;D
While he was serving the people of New Mexico, he attained and preserved and was appropriately complimented for his willingness to protect the interests of all New Mexicans.;D
I have no doubt that he will carry this trait with him into the CPSC, this same commitment to ensuring the safety of American consumers.;D
He's trying diligently to finish the energy bill on the floor, on which he's doing a very good job.;D
But I understand he will communicate, if he hasn't already, his support for the President's nominee.;N
I'm pleased to be here, and I hope that you will interrogate as much as you need to and expeditiously report him out to the Senate for approval.;N
As I indicated, the Senate Commerce Committee is meeting on the confirmation hearing for Mr. Harold Stratton.;N
As we know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission chairmanship is a position that's gone vacant far too long.;N
So long, in fact, that the statutory provision which allows the Consumer Product Safety Commission to operate with a quorum of two commissioners expires at the end of this month.;N
I'm sure that he and his family are proud to be here today, and when I recognize Mr. Stratton, I will ask him to recognize his family.;N
As far as I'm concerned, with Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman in your corner, you are running with the right crowd.;N
Let me just mention an area in particular that I want to explore with you, because we know of your background, and particularly that this is a new area, this whole area of consumer product safety and consumer safety that we're going to be discussing today.;D
You are known, of course, for your long-time interest in addressing free-market approaches to various questions in government.;N
You've been involved in foundations that address areas where free-market approaches are stressed.;D
I want to make it clear that I think that those are very fine and important principles, that free-market initiatives are critically important to our country.;N
However, the Consumer Product Safety Commission really came into being because the free-market alone wouldn't address many of the concerns that children, older people, and the disabled have with respect to consumer protection.;N
So what I'd like to do is explore with you your sense of what is the proper role of the federal government and what are the areas where consumers have responsibilities.;N
I look forward to your statement and having a chance to visit with you a bit this afternoon as we examine your nomination.;N
I'm trying to understand a bit about how you would administer the CPSC and also what your objectives would be.;N
You described several of them, including consultation with other agencies and consumer education.;N
The first question is why do you want to be the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission?;N
Well, the reason I'm asking the question is--I guess it's a philosophic question, really, in terms of consumer products and so forth.;N
Several decades ago, Mr. Nader raised the question of unsafe automobiles, and we went through a long period of debate about these issues.;N
The automobile he raised questions about caught fire when it was rear-ended because of the way the fuel tank was placed.;N
He has since become a consumer advocate, and I'm just curious how you view--perhaps I shouldn't have used Ralph Nader, per se--but how do you view the consumer advocates out there, perhaps symbolized by him?;N
If one is a pro-business, free-market person, one, perhaps, comes down on the side of saying, you know, ``I don't like this notion of intrusion and constantly taking on those that are making these products, whether it's child seats or automobiles, for that matter.'';N
"We, of course, will want someone in the Consumer Product Safety Commission who says, ``Look, I'm here on behalf of the American consumer and the American public, paid by taxpayers' dollars, and I'm going to be a tiger on these issues of demanding that products be safe; and when not safe, I'm going to take on the companies who produce them.''";N
Tell us, if you would, a bit about what you did as attorney general of New Mexico, because most attorneys general, of course, are the top consumer advocates in their states.;N
Your office, perhaps, as the office in North Dakota and many others do, had the charge of consumer protection.;N
Mr. Stratton, perhaps because of where I come from, I've never considered the issue of art fraud.;N
I think I understand what you mean, coming from New Mexico and serving as attorney general.;N
I asked you to recite what you had done with respect to consumer protection as attorney general, and I'm aware of your accomplishments because I've reviewed your record, but I wanted you to be able to put it on the record, as well.;N
There is one thing that I read about you that concerned me just a bit, and I would like you to respond to it.;N
When you were attorney general, you wrote to the Wall Street Journal, taking your fellow attorneys general to task on an issue of merger guidelines, an area of business regulation.;D
You said, quote: ``They are using the cover of `consumer protection' to impose their anti-business, pro-government-regulation views on the entire nation and are bypassing the legislative process to put in place `enforcement guidelines' that Congress itself refuses to pass.'';N
Then there was a ``compact'' dealing with horizontal corporate mergers in which 44 attorneys general signed, but you did not, saying, ``We have enough government interference in our economy without a new group joining the anti-business parade.'';D
However, the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission has to be a tiger and an advocate on behalf of consumers with respect to product safety.;N
When a business produces a product that's unsafe, we need someone that's going to move very quickly.;N
It won't be considered pro-business to move quickly against those that produce an unsafe product, but it will be considered part of the charter of the head of the CPSC.;N
So if you will, respond to me on the two issues that I just raised that were also part of the briefing here.;N
Those were both when you were attorney general, and your statements with respect to them suggest a slightly different mindset than when I asked the question about being pro-business.;N
We all know how important the Consumer Product Safety Commission is, and we need you there for it to be working with all of its members.;N
As the Chairman knows, the 6-month statutory deadline that allows the CPSC to perform its duties with only two commissioners expires on May 1, so it's important that we move as quickly as possible.;N
I didn't quite get your explanation on the airline advertising, but I'll accept it anyway, Mr. Stratton.;N
And congratulations, again, not only for this appointment, but your previous service to the State of New Mexico, of which Arizona was once part of the New Mexico Territory, as you recall.;D
There's no question in my mind that there are instances of products that are defective that you've really got to stand up for the consumer for, and you've got to do it even if people aren't using them perfectly, because the world doesn't always play out that way.;N
Let me ask you, along the same lines that I talked about earlier, with respect to free-market principles, where you would draw the line between voluntary standards and mandatory standards at the Commission?;N
As you know, the Commission tries to use voluntary standards to the greatest extent possible.;N
At the same time, there have got to be instances where you do use the mandatory approach, which, of course, carries the force of law.;N
When, in your view, in terms of just conceptually, do you think mandatory standards are appropriate?;N
You've got big decisions coming up at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, decisions with respect to arsenic and various kinds of materials that children may come in contact with on playgrounds.;D
You cannot prejudge any of those, and I don't want to ask you to do so today, but I think it would be very helpful in terms of getting a sense of how you would approach these kinds of questions, whether there are certain principles--other than the Act, of course, and I appreciate your earlier answers where you've made it clear that you're committed to following the Act--but tell us, if you would, given the fact that there are some big decisions coming up, give us a sense of how you're going to go about tackling them, recognizing that you certainly can't comment on things like that at this point.;N
The only other question I wanted to ask today--most of your previous record, you know, relates to consumer fraud.;N
But the Consumer Product Safety Commission really isn't aimed primarily at outright fraud.;N
It's obvious that products can be unsafe even if manufacturers are well intentioned and honest.;N
What would you cite as your big consumer accomplishments up to this point, other than in areas combating fraud?;N
Well, let me wrap up, then, by saying, given the limited resources at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, you're going to have to make some choices.;D
And, if you would, wrap up for me by saying a little bit about what principles you'd use in setting your priorities, if confirmed, at the CPSC.;N
I think you have an outstanding record, both in the private sector and in public service, having served as the attorney general of New Mexico, and I think you'll make an outstanding Chairman and Commissioner on the Consumer Product Safety Commission.;D
In this Committee, we're very actively involved in consumer affairs, and look forward to working with you.;N
And I see nothing in your background, really, that needs any clarification, in my judgment.;D
And I just want to congratulate you on your accomplishments to date, thus far, and I hope you have smooth sailing through the process here.;D
As we have obviously perused all of the records that have been submitted to us about your background and your work, there is one question regarding your role as the president of a non-profit organization, the Rio Grande Foundation.;D
On its website, in the announcement of its creation it states: ``The Rio Grande Foundation promotes public policy founded upon the principle of limited government, economic freedom, and individual responsibility.'';N
In the context of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which, by its charter, is not about limited government, it's about using that agency to take a look at all the businesses that are producing products and trying to find those that are putting unsafe products on the market and prevent that from happening.;N
So describe to me how one reconciles what this organization, the non-profit, says, and what the role of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman requires and how you will straddle that.;N
I mean, there are some who feel that if someone produces an unsafe product, it means that eventually people will experience it being unsafe and not purchase it, and the free-market actually will ultimately correct itself.;N
We have some--not in Congress, fortunately--but we have some people writing to us saying there ought not be inspection of meat, for example.;N
If people are producing unsafe meat making people sick, eventually no one will buy from them and that's the way to resolve this, through the free-market system.;N
I wouldn't want someone like that to come to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and your responses today tell me that that's certainly not your view.;N
We hope that we have a Consumer Product Safety Commission that is active, aggressive, and that, at the end of the term of the new Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, that we can look back and say, this was a person that was a real tiger on issues where the American consumers, and especially children, were being injured by unsafe products.;D
He used, or she used, the tools of that office aggressively and effectively relative to the charter of that Commission.;N
Speaking for myself, that would be my aspiration, and I believe of others on the Committee, as well.;N
Again, with all of those who come to the call of public service, our country thanks those who offer themselves to public service.;D
Our Committee will certainly evaluate your response today, but your responses have been very helpful to me, I must say.;D
Let me include in the record a statement by the Full Committee Chairman, Senator Hollings, who was not able to be at this hearing.;N
I believe we perhaps, also have some questions that we will want to direct and ask that you respond in writing.;D
And, as I said, I think your responses have been helpful to us, and you've been very forthcoming.;D
This morning's hearing is for the confirmation of the nomination of Mr. Steven Robert Blust as our new Federal Maritime Commissioner.;N
We are happy to have her here, and pleased to have you in attendance, and thank you for allowing him to serve.;N
The Federal Maritime Commission, as everyone here knows, is a very important, independent commission.;N
It is one that maybe the average person in Washington, the average person in the United States, does not understand, or is not very familiar with, but for those who are interested in trade, trading opportunities, fair trade, and level playing fields in the international arena, the Federal Maritime Commission obviously is very, very important.;N
I want to congratulate Mr. Blust, you personally on your nomination, and also express my sincere appreciation on behalf of this Committee and, indeed, all Members of the Senate for your willingness to step out of the private sector and into a job that I am certain will pay a lot less financially, in terms of financial reward, but in terms of the challenges and the ability to do good things for your country and your nation, I know that it is a very rewarding challenge.;N
The current Chairman, Hal Creel, is a good friend of this Committee and a good friend of mine, served on my staff as Counsel and Staff Director in his prior life.;D
I understand that it is the President's desire that when you, Mr. Blust, join the Commission, you will begin service as the Chairman of the Commission.;D
Hal has done a terrific job, and we appreciate his long service and the record that he has established in this very important position.;D
Sometimes these duties have to be carried out with the honey and sugar approach, and sometimes you need to use the 2x4 approach.;N
I think Hal has used both, from talking nicely to our trading partners and our port authorities around the world, to threatening to close the Port of Japan.;N
We have done just about everything during your tenure, but that is the type of perspective that I think is needed in this very important position.;D
I am delighted, Mr. Blust, that you are a person who comes to this nomination process with a great deal of professional credibility and background.;D
However, coming from your industry perspective, currently as manager of the Tampa Bay International Terminals, and prior to that, working for Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, the Port of Jacksonville, Crowley Maritime, Delta Steamship, and graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy.;D
You had the good fortune of going to Louisiana, as Hal did, and receiving an MBA degree at Tulane in New Orleans.;D
You obviously have the professional background, training, and educational experience I think that is needed in this job.;D
No one can suggest that you are just a political appointee that they found a place for in the Administration.;D
You are a professional, extremely well-qualified individual, and we look forward to having you in that position.;D
I understand that Senator Bill Nelson from Florida was going to try and be here, but since he is not able, he sends his regards.;N
Thank you, Mr. Blust, for being with us and for, again, your willingness to serve in this position.;D
You mention in your statement the question of security and, of course, that is appropriately the buzz word in Washington, as it appropriately should be today.;N
About security, we happen to believe that port security is something that should be the highest priority.;N
We reported out of this Committee amendments to that Act to make it even stronger, yet the House of Representatives has failed to--I am sorry, they did pass it last night.;N
Good news, they passed it last night, so at least the House has now finally acted, so we ought to have a port security bill passed by the Senate and the House and hopefully, the conference can come through with something quickly.;N
My point in raising this is, how do you envision the Federal Maritime Commission being helpful in this whole area?;N
As I have said in the past, we are not just going to be able to allow the Coast Guard to do everything.;N
It seems that a lot of the ports and a lot of people in the shipping business feel that the Coast Guard is going to take care of port security.;N
It actually has to be local government officials, local port authorities, the Coast Guard, state police, the National Guard, port and harbor police, everybody has to be involved.;N
Now, I am wondering whether you envision any potential role for the Federal Maritime Commission in providing information, perhaps, to the Department of Transportation in terms of shipping contracts and who is doing what, and cargo, and anything of that nature.;N
Is there anything that can come out of the Federal Maritime Commission that could be helpful in the area of security?;N
I would certainly encourage you to do that as Chairman, and Hal being down there, it seems that a lot of the problems that we are seeing in intelligence information is due to a lack of sharing that information among the relevant agencies and the government, the CIA not wanting to tell the FBI, the FBI not wanting to tell the state police, and people wanting to keep their information internally, and sometimes if that information is shared, the results will be far more positive in helping to stop things that should not happen before they happen.;N
I would really encourage the FMC to take a look at everything you all do and say, look, can anybody else benefit from this information?;N
You would hate to find out that you had information internally that, had it gone to the proper law enforcement authorities from a criminal standpoint, or from an intelligence standpoint, may have prevented shipments from going someplace and causing damage.;N
If you have information that should set off flags and bells and whistles that something is wrong with this, we have never seen this carrier before in this trade, and is there something we need to check here, and do not hesitate to do that.;N
Let me ask a question about this recent Supreme Court decision, which I happened to read in the paper, and I see the staff has it listed here, about the cruise line that filed suit against the Port of South Carolina alleging discrimination in favoring one carrier over another carrier.;N
That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court, in a recent 5-4 decision, said the FMC does not have jurisdiction to litigate against states, that the states are protected against federal suits because of state sovereignty.;N
As I read the Supreme Court decision, you are going to be prohibited from taking any action against any kind of state port authority.;N
You interpret the case to mean that the Federal Maritime Commission on its own initiative could file a complaint in Federal court against a State port authority for discrimination?;N
But you interpret that case to mean that in the same set of facts in the South Carolina case that was presented at the Supreme Court, that had the carrier just informed the FMC of discrimination, and the FMC considered that evidence, that the FMC on their own then could file a complaint in federal court?;N
That is an interesting idea, because you do not get that from reading the newspaper accounts of the case.;N
Well, Mr. Blust, we are joined by our Ranking Member from the great maritime state of Arizona.;N
The President has appointed a terrific gentleman here who is a Merchant Marine graduate, John, and with a great deal of experience in this business, to be Chairman.;D
I congratulate you, sir, on your nomination to be Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission.;N
With your years of experience serving in the maritime community, including your current position as President and CEO of Tampa Bay International Terminals, and your previous experiences, you are well-qualified, I believe.;D
In your role, you will have the unique responsibility of setting the course the Commission takes over the next several years, and it will be important that, given the limited resources, the priorities you establish are sound and carried out in an efficient manner.;D
Over the past several years, the liberalized exemption authority under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act has helped diminish this fear of collusion among carriers.;N
A more defined commercial market system is creating new openings to increase trade among nations.;N
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act has begun to show signs of success, and I would like to see this pattern of deregulation continue.;N
The duties of the Commission are important to the daily functions of trade and commerce in the United States.;N
In the age of the global marketplace, you will be in a position that can help ensure fair maritime trading practices.;D
I am confident you will be up to the challenges in store for you both as a Commissioner and as a Chairman.;N
Exercising the duties of old age and latitude on this Committee, I want to ask you what may be viewed by you as an off-the-wall question.;N
Why is it that every yacht of any size that I see in any port in America with an American name on it has a foreign flag, any large vessel that you see in any port?;N
It is because of the Jones Act, I am told, and that is that if you want to have a crew on your yacht, then that crew has to be all American employees.;N
So all of these American yacht owners register their boats in Liberia, or the Cayman Islands, or some other place, so that they can have foreign-born and foreign citizens onboard their ships.;N
Does the Maritime Commission get involved in the issue of flagging non-commercial vessels?;N
I was reading a story about Mr. Charles Taylor, the Liberian dictator who has been responsible for the deaths of thousands and thousands of people, I am told, in numbers, and according to several stories I have read, one of his major sources of revenue is from ships registered under a Liberian flag.;N
Should it not bother you that ships owned by citizens of the United States of America that operate carrying mainly U.S. goods and products around the world should be subsidizing and keeping in power a ruthless dictator who--I mean, the crimes that they have committed are unspeakable.;N
Should we not look at why the laws are such that we drive these ships to register in a God-awful place like Liberia?;N
I doubt if there is one Liberian citizen that has any interest of any kind in any of these ships.;N
Well, again, I understand that it is out of the norm, but those two issues have bothered me for some time, and I congratulate you on your nomination, and I look forward to working with you and Senator Breaux, who does represent a coastal State, who will be working with you more than I will, but I am sure you will enjoy that as well.;N
I again congratulate you on your nomination, and we look forward to having you at work as soon as possible.;N
During the port security hearing, it is interesting that one of the things we learned was that Panama, which is also a flag of convenience where many of these ships are flagged, we actually caught them, the U.S. government, providing about a thousand false documents for Panamanian sailors on Panamanian ships.;N
I mean, you just go in there and pay your money, and you get your documentation that you are a licensed crew person to serve on those vessels.;N
These vessels come into every port in the United States, many of them with crews that have false documentation.;N
How easy it is for a potential terrorist to go down to Panama and pay the right person, get the documentation that you are a licensed seaman to sail on one of their vessels, and to come into the Port of New Orleans, or the Port of Long Beach, or anywhere else, and cause a great deal of damage.;N
Well, I thank the Senator for making that point, and Mr. Chairman-to-be, congratulations, and we will get to your confirmation just as soon as we can, and with that, the hearing will stand adjourned.;N
This morning, our first order of business is going to be a hearing on the nomination of Rebecca Dye to be our new Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission.;N
Our friend and colleague, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska is here, and unfortunately, Senator Stevens has a voice problem this morning.;N
His statement, recognizing his strong support for Ms. Dye and her distinguished work as a counsel for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, will be made a part of the record.;D
We want to move quickly so Ms. Dye can get back to work on the port security legislation and other matters that we are currently addressing.;N
We are delighted to have you here, and if you would like to introduce any family members you have and present your statement to the Committee, we would be pleased to proceed.;N
We had a previous hearing on the Chairman-to-be, Mr. Blust, and Mr. Creel joined us as well.;N
If it just stays with the FMC and is not somehow shared with some of the law enforcement agencies, whether it is the FBI or the new Homeland Security Department, it is very important information, and should not just be pigeonholed and put in a box somewhere at the FMC.;N
You have access to information that could be exceedingly valuable, and I think we should make sure we have a system whereby it is shared by those who need to have it shared.;N
We probably have some additional questions we might submit to you, but for the moment I think that will suffice with my questions.;N
I take it that Senator Stevens, if he has questions, they would be submitted in writing, and we will operate under that format.;N
Mr. Chairman, I was searching the map this morning once again looking for oceans and ports in West Virginia, and I failed to come up with any, so I only have to assume that I am going to vote for this nominee.;N
Senator Nelson seems to be on a tight time schedule, and he'd like to make some comments and introduce one of the nominees, and we'll recognize him for that purpose.;N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is my pleasure to be here on behalf of Fred Gregory.;N
NASA is this wonderful little $15-billion-a-year agency that encapsulates the hopes and the dreams and the desires of the American people.;N
What child, what student, can you not find a way to interest them in science and mathematics and technology by talking to them about the space program?;N
That is just one of the reasons that it's so very important that we have the right kind of management for NASA.;N
I believe that the right person for Deputy Administrator, the number-two position in the agency, is Fred Gregory.;N
He has vast experience with NASA, having come to NASA as a--and retiring--Colonel in the United States Air Force after he had had a career logging 7,000 hours in more than 50 types of aircraft, including 550 combat missions in Vietnam.;D
Fred came to NASA as a pilot astronaut, and I can tell you that they pick only the best of the best.;D
In that capacity, Fred has flown three missions, one in the right seat as pilot, and two in the left seat as commander.;D
He served as Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight, in an acting capacity, and then he was selected permanently in that position in February of this year.;D
He was responsible in that position of management in overseeing the International Space Station, Space Shuttle operations, space access using expendable launch vehicles for commercial launch services, space communications, and advanced programs.;D
Before that, he was an Associate Administrator of the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance.;D
In this capacity, he was responsible for assuring the safety, reliability, quality, and mission assurance of all NASA programs.;D
That post is particularly important to NASA after awful mistakes on the Apollo launch pad caused a fire that killed three astronauts.;N
Mistakes occurred again in January of 1986, which resulted in the Challenger disaster and a renewed committment to safety.;N
Now, you've heard me, Mr. Chairman, from this very position on this very Committee, keep saying over and over that we have got to find the resources in NASA to do the safety upgrades in the Space Shuttle, because we should never get to a position where we compromise safety.;N
And so it would give me--and I bring to the Committee for its consideration--a great deal of assurance of having someone like Fred as the Deputy Administrator so that, as attuned as he is, not only to the astronaut corps, but as experienced as he is having been the head of safety for NASA, it is a very, very important component of how NASA ought to be managed these days.;D
So, Mr. Chairman, I bring to you an astronaut, a test pilot, a manager of flight safety programs, and launch support operations.;N
Today, the Committee is going to consider the nominations of Fred Gregory to be Deputy Administrator of NASA, and Kathie Olsen and Richard Russell to be Associate Directors in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
In particular, we address the three nominees with your prospective bosses, Sean O'Keefe, John Marburger, and we're glad that all of you are here.;N
I do want to say that all three of these individuals in this panel seem eminently qualified.;D
What you'll hear from me most of the time is, ``Remember the aeronautics aspect of NASA.'';N
And so while you may be concerned about the Space Station, let us not forget the importance of research and development and making sure our country stays in the lead, or at least be competitive with the Europeans and the Japanese, as far as research in aeronautics.;N
And I know that Chairman Wyden and I have had hearings in our Subcommittee referencing that.;N
But, Mr. Chairman, my main purpose here is to share with you my pleasure in the nomination of Mr. Richard Russell, as nominated by the President, to be Associate Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
His wife, Lynley, is here, holding little George Wolverton there, who's reading now, as opposed to voting for his father.;N
Lynley's father, his father-in-law, Dr. Ogilvie, is here and his aunt, Mrs. Sloan is here, as well, and we welcome you all here, backing up Richard.;N
Just so you all know, Mr. Russell is a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, calling Fairfax County his home.;N
He's a son of a career foreign service officer, who gained the rank of Ambassador before retiring.;D
Mr. Russell did travel the world extensively growing up himself, but, showing great judgment, always returned to Virginia.;D
I'm pleased that we're going to have an individual with his technological expertise as one of the leaders in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;D
Virginia is one of the fastest growing technology communities, as is Oregon, so we share those similarities.;N
I think that as you, Mr. Chairman, and I have worked on NET Guard, and hopefully we'll get that through very shortly, there's an understanding that much of what we need to do in homeland security can be performed with the adaptation and the implementation of good ideas that are already out there in the private sector and adapt them to our needs in law enforcement and cyber-security and transportation and elsewhere.;N
Now, as the White House officer responsible for giving advice on these matters of science and technology, I think that Mr. Russell is going to play a very important role in setting these Federal policies that'll facilitate the continued growth and implementation of technology, not just from Virginia, but obviously from all over our country.;D
Prior to the President's nominating him to this post, Mr. Russell served as the Chief of Staff of OSTP.;D
He also joined OSTP from the House Committee on Science, which was a really great Committee in those days with Congressman Walker.;D
And during his 6 years on the Committee, he rose through the ranks from Professional Staff to Staff Director of the Technology Subcommittee, later to Deputy Chief of Staff for the Full Committee.;D
In those capacities, Mr. Russell worked on a broad array of legislation and policies impacting technology development, including technology workforce issues, computer security research, Y2K and technology transfer.;D
Much of what's going to need to be done in the area of cyber-security, I think, will need to be analyzed in some of the ways we analyzed Y2K compliance and the capability of achieving that once the year 2000 came, the capability of systems to meet that change in the date.;N
The same needs to be done as standards in determining whether or not agencies are secure from cyber-;N
I can't think of a better addition, Mr. Chairman, to this important office than Mr. Russell.;D
And, in fact, the American Association of Engineering Societies, whose representation has over a million engineers nationwide, said this, and I quote: ``His leadership on information technology, research and development, and on other issues makes us confident that Mr. Russell is the right man for the job.;D
He shares our mission of using technology, be it from the private or public sector, to make our country safer and our economy more robust.'';D
We look forward to working with you, and I hope our Committee approves him in on the floor as quickly as possible.;N
If you could just summarize your principal concerns, and then we're going to begin the questions with Senator McCain, because I know he's on a tight schedule.;N
It's something that we began to address in this Committee years ago, and unfortunately the budget has now lurched completely out of control.;N
I'd like to know if you agree or disagree when you begin, because I'd like you to start out by answering the question.;N
I would like to know whether you agree or disagree with that question, or don't answer the question.;N
Mr. Russell, do you agree or disagree with this summary of the ``Climate Change Impacts on the United States'' report?;N
I will oppose both of your nominations until we get an answer to a simple, basic question, and I'll see if you'll answer----;N
I would like you to answer the question whether you agree or disagree with that statement.;N
It's a pretty straightforward statement, and I would like to know if you agree or disagree.;N
And it is unusual, by the way, to have witnesses, particularly here for confirmation, not to answer a rather simple straightforward question.;N
In Dr. Marburger's statement before the Committee on July 11th, Dr. Marburger said, and I quote: ``This is why reports such as the 2002 Climate Action Report do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.;N
That report employs `scenarios' that are invented to capture the range of results of multiple runs of different climate models with different ad hoc input assumptions.;N
The scenarios are then used to make `projections,' a word that is carefully defined in an important footnote . . . of the report . . .;N
I fear that many readers of the Climate Action Report have mistaken its `projections' for forecasts.'';N
"By the way, the quote I gave you was from the ``Climate Change Impacts on the United States,'' not the ``Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Key Questions,'' and it doesn't matter whether you've read it or not; it's a straigthforward statement, and I would like to know if you agree or disagree.";N
Now, have you read page three of the report, which says, quote: ``By how much will temperatures change over the next 100 years and where?'';N
The answer: ``Climate change simulations for the period 1990 to 2100, based on the IPCC emissions scenarios, yield a globally-;N
averaged surface temperature increase by the end of the century of 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius, (2.5 to 10.4 degrees Farenheit), relative to 1990.;N
The wide range of uncertainty in these estimates reflects both the different assumptions about future concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the various scenarios considered by the IPCC and the differing climate sensitivities of various climate models used in the simulation.'';N
Quote: ``The range of climate sensitivities implied by these predictions is generally consistent with previously reported values.'';N
Yet Dr. Marburger states that this report doesn't make predictions, when clearly, on page three, it says, and I quote again: ``The range of climate sensitivities implied by these predictions is generally consistent with the previous reported values.'';N
Well, then why is it that Dr. Marburger said--and I'm sorry that I had to leave the hearing early--``That's why reports such as the 2002 U.S. Climate Action Report do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.'';N
But Dr. Marburger says this is why reports such as the 2002 U.S. Climate Action Report ``do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.'';N
I noted with interest that neither you nor Mr. Russell, as part of your heavy responsibilities that you hope to assume, mentioned anything about climate change.;D
To begin the process within this Administration, the President last year--``The changes observed over the last several likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out some significant part of these changes are due to a reflection of natural variability.'';N
Over the 20th century, the average annual U.S. temperature has risen by almost 1 degree Farenheit, (0.6 degrees Celsius), and precipitation has increased nationally by 5 to 10 percent, mostly due to increases in heavy downpours.;N
The science indicates that the warming in the 21st century will be significantly greater than in the 20th century.;N
Scenarios examined in this assessment, which assume no major interventions to reduce''--which is apparently what you countenance--``no major interventions to reduce continued growth to world greenhouse gas emissions indicate that temperatures in the U.S. will rise by about 5-9 degrees Farenheit, (3-5 degrees Celsius), on average, in the next 100 years, which is more than the projected global increase.'';N
Well, what this is all about is one of the more astonishing statements that I've seen before this Committee.;N
Over this past several years, we have had a series of hearings before this Committee on climate change, the best scientific evidence from all over the world, as well as the country, and there is near unanimous--not unanimous--near unanimous agreement that climate change is taking place and that human activity is responsible for a significant part of it.;N
And Dr. Marburger comes before this Committee and states that we don't have the ability to predict that there are questions that are significant about whether we can even predict more than a few days, the climate, and it was probably one of the more astonishing performances.;N
The President, by the way, as you described all the other things, did say that, yes, he read this bureaucratic product, or something along those lines--basically dismissed it.;N
There are Members of this Committee that have been working on this issue for a long time, including me.;N
To wit, in South Africa there will be a meeting of some 60 nations early in September trying to work our way through this issue so that we can reduce this direct threat to our environment.;N
And since the United States produces 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, with 5 percent of the population, we think we do have some responsibilities there.;N
Unfortunately, there will be only a congressional representation there as real participants.;N
So I can see that, from Dr. Marburger's statements and yours, Dr. Olsen, that we have a very serious challenge, because there is no credibility to Dr. Marburger's statement.;N
And my disappointment in yours, not being able to understand a single paragraph and give me a definitive answer, is also very disappointing.;N
And I've very disturbed that Dr. Marburger would come forward with a statement such as he did.;N
we will have further hearings, and I'm sure Dr. Marburger will have a chance to defend his position.;N
I think any way you look at it, we are basically alone out there with respect to 180 other nations.;N
The irony for this Senator is that there are a number of them out there that are bipartisan.;N
For example, we've found repeatedly that carbon sequestration programs, programs that are supported by the environmentalists, by the timber industry, could deal with perhaps a quarter of the global warming problem in a way that is going to win bipartisan support--Senator Craig, Senator Brownback--a whole host of Senators have been involved in this.;N
But we're not going to be able to get on top of any real progress in programs unless we acknowledge the seriousness of the science.;N
Let me just finish up on this topic, before we go to some others, with a couple of questions.;N
Do the two of you, Dr. Olsen and Mr. Russell, do you support the proposition that human activities are a significant factor in the climate change problem?;N
Then I'll just wrap up this topic, Dr. Olsen, by asking you to explain the Administration's policy and why you think it's going to reduce greenhouse gas intensity.;N
Now, as you know, the head on the Council on Environmental Quality has said that this position is going to allow U.S. emissions to rise.;N
I think we would like to have on the record why you believe that the Administration's position is going to address climate change in a positive way.;N
We'll keep the record open for your answer, but I will tell you, I think it is very unfortunate that we can't get an acknowledgment of the science here.;N
In fact, it's not clear to me what, in effect, we're going to do other than to try to convince them that somehow we're right and they're wrong, because I think that they have clearly concluded otherwise.;N
I think that you're good people and people who have a distinguished career in public service.;D
So we'll expect, in future appearances, that you're able to address these issues in a more comprehensive way.;D
We're going to go on to some other topics, but this will not be the last time we talk about this in this Committee.;N
The General Accounting Office issued a report yesterday on the Space Station with respect to significant challenges that they believe continue.;N
Is it going to continue to be a work in progress, or when are we going to get a final plan?;N
Now, the ReMAP effort, the Research Maximization and Prioritization task force--that is a mouthful--put out a new report making various recommendations.;N
But, to me, the real question is how soon is it going to be possible to move the Space Station beyond being a great engineering feat into a research program?;N
When Administrator O'Keefe was here last, we had a big group of high school students in the back, and I asked him a question essentially about students in space.;N
And if a student met every single one of the requirements--every one of them--for mission specialists that are required today, what would be wrong with that?;N
After Administrator O'Keefe gasped, and you could see it, you know, in his face, he said that he'd look into it.;N
How do you feel about having a research program that would really determine how we could get young people more inspired and more involved in space, including looking at the question of if they met all of the requirements of a mission specialist, including being allowed to go?;N
If those young people are going to fight in battlefields all around the world, it seems to me, if they're qualified, they shouldn't be cut off from these opportunities either.;D
We're talking about people who can go fight in Afghanistan and who can go out and defend this country, whether, if they're qualified, they could be a mission specialist.;N
I would only hope that the agency would say that if you're qualified, if you meet all of the bottom-line requirements, your government isn't going to hold you back.;D
The government is going to be looking for ways in which you tap your potential, particularly when you can have scientists and young people, like we saw in this room when Mr. O'Keefe was talking about it.;N
I just even started the question, and these young people who were studying science broke into applause.;N
We ought to give them a reason to dream, not to have sort of silly ideas that children at little-league age can go to space or something like that, but that if you can go fight for your country and you can meet the qualifications required of a mission specialist, age alone shouldn't rule you out.;N
I don't want the agency to start anything tomorrow or the next day or the next day, but I want the agency to research it.;N
I mean, really, I think all I wanted to convey is let's do the research, and let's tap all of our opportunities.;N
There has been concern about the Administration's intention to nominate two rather than four Associate Directors of OSTP.;N
The concern is that the Administration wouldn't have the Associate Director positions for national security and for the environment that were present before.;N
They're important ones, as you know, given energy bill's efforts to try to deal with it, and we're anxious to work with you on it, but we've got to get those issues to visibility and the attention that's important.;N
For you, Mr. Russell and Dr. Olsen, let's talk about the coordination between your offices and the new Department of Homeland Security.;N
I want to preface this by saying that Dr. Marburger and all of those associated with your organization have been very helpful, very constructive to us in working on our efforts to mobilize science and technology experts in the homeland security effort.;D
Tell us, if you would, how you see OSTP and the new Homeland Security Department interacting and coordinating, particularly research and development across the agencies.;N
Mr. Russell, how would you put the current troubles of the technology sector in perspective?;N
As you know, it wasn't very many years ago when few would say we'd see the kind of problems in the tech sector we're seeing now.;N
What do the current struggles say to you about the role of technology and the economy and the potential of technology to spur productivity?;N
Does the crisis in the tech sector require any major changes in the way government thinks about technology policy, in your view, Mr. Russell?;N
Dr. Olsen, as you could tell, and I welcomed your statement, I want to see a much more aggressive effort to get women in the hard sciences.;N
You've got a track record in this area and you've served as a Federal representative for the Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities that was established by the Congress in 1998, and you made recommendations, as I understand it, to help achieve the objectives.;D
What were some of the things you fought for, the areas that you really pursued as a commission member?;N
Are there other new initiatives or new programs that you'd like to pursue in your new position to go after these big disparities?;N
Mr. Gregory, the NASA program is going to put a new focus on education, and I think it's very welcome.;N
How would you like to go about encouraging more women to get into science and engineering?;N
I also hope that you all will really set out some goals so that we have a chance to measure which programs are not working and which programs are making a difference.;N
We've talked to the Administrator about it, and we'll hope to have your support for that, as well.;D
On the government labs, I think we know that a lot of the laboratories in the facilities which support government scientific enterprises were built decades ago, 40, 50 years ago, and are in tremendous disrepair.;N
What would you see as your role, as your office's role, in helping to put in place a plan to get the upgrades and necessary improvements done?;N
I think you, Dr. Olsen, and you, Mr. Russell, understand that Senator McCain has some concerns on the climate change question.;N
"I want us to understand that the science here is no longer in question; it is indisputable.";N
I want to see the remedies to the problems--one along the lines that I mentioned--that will be supported on a bipartisan basis in the U.S. Senate that will bring together people across the political and economic spectrum, as we've been able to do in carbon sequestration.;N
I think that once we can get on top of an acknowledgment with respect to the science and what humans contribute and the other underpinnings of the science question, then we can begin to go to the next level, which is to talk about programs that are constructed and well thought out and practical.;N
But Senator McCain has indicated that he can't support the two of you, Dr. Olsen, and you, Mr. Russell, at this time, so I hope you can get back to Senator McCain, address his concerns.;N
I want to see all three of you confirmed as soon as we possibly can, and I think that is Chairman Hollings' desire as well.;N
This is not a huge surprise that there are disagreements between some of us on the this side of the dais and in the Administration on the climate change question.;N
But I do think that on some of the fundamental science questions, we've got to acknowledge common ground.;N
Once we do that, then we go to the next level, and people like me are anxious to meet the Administration halfway as we have done so consistently in a variety of areas.;N
It ought to be driven by the dreams and hopes of scientists and at lab benches and other facilities.;N
This afternoon, the Committee will consider the nomination of Jonathan Adelstein to be Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.;N
Mr. Adelstein currently serves as an advisor to our esteemed Senate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle.;D
I'd like to take this moment to welcome Mr. Adelstein and ask him to introduce to the Committee his family members and friends who have accompanied him today.;N
I thank you very much, and I'd like to welcome the members of the family and congratulate them.;N
I think Mr. Adelstein will play an important role in guiding American telecommunications policy in the digital age, and I think he's fully qualified for performing those duties despite the years of service that he spent with Senator Daschle.;D
I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Adelstein recently, and found him to be thoughtful and committed to serving consumer interests.;N
I commend him on his career in public service, and I appreciate his willingness to undertake the tremendous responsibility of serving as an FCC Commissioner.;D
I am grateful to have the opportunity to appear before you, and I have a formal statement that, with your consent, I would like inserted into the record.;N
Let me just say that it is a great day for our country and certainly a proud moment for me.;N
It is especially an honor that so many of the Adelstein family has come for this special occasion.;N
But I must say, in all my time in public life, I have never presented a nominee with greater confidence and with greater enthusiasm.;N
I know him as someone who is ready to respond to the challenges that Senator McCain so eloquently just described.;N
We have a big challenge at the FCC, and I know of no one who can do it better than Jonathan Adelstein.;N
So it's a pleasure for me to be at his side on this special occasion, on this important day.;N
I thank the Committee, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your willingness to hold this hearing so that we can move to meet these challenges in the near future.;N
And let me begin by thanking Chairman Hollings for calling this important hearing on the nomination of Jonathan Adelstein to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission.;N
I want to thank you and Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, for participating in this overdue hearing today.;N
Mr. Chairman, if I could ask unanimous consent to insert a letter by the Governor of South Dakota, Governor Bill Janklow, in support of the nominee in the record at this point.;N
Could we say, we know that the other Senators have important duties, and we thank you for appearing on behalf of this witness.;N
As a South Dakotan, I think I have two of the best Senators in the U.S. Senate, with all due respect to the current Members here.;N
Senator McCain, I appreciate your generous comments, as well, and I enjoyed having the chance to talk to you about critical telecommunications issues.;N
I'm also grateful to President Bush for sending my nomination forward, and also to Governor Bill Janklow for his stalwart support throughout this entire process.;N
Finally, I'd like to say a word to my fellow Members of the Senate staff, the crowd who's sitting behind you on the dais, where I sat for so many years myself.;N
Without the work that we've done together, without the help of you, my friends, my colleagues, and my mentors, I would not be prepared to pursue this opportunity.;N
Senator Daschle also charged me with helping to develop a comprehensive congressional technology agenda which Senator Daschle and Representative Dick Gephardt unveiled live on the Internet in April, 2001.;N
It contained a detailed series of proposals to spur innovation, productivity, economic growth and job creation.;N
This effort required extensive consultation with each of the many Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over technology issues and the many Members of Congress with an interest in these issues.;N
This exercise helped me establish a broad vision for promoting U.S. technological development in which the FCC, along with many other Federal agencies, plays an important role.;N
I have also worked with Senator Daschle on initiatives to promote efficient spectrum management, improve the availability of local-to-;N
local television service to all regions of the U.S., and to establish the validity of electronic signatures and numerous of other telecommunications initiatives.;N
As Senator Daschle's leading banking and financial services advisor, I have also gained a solid understanding of the operations and structure of the capital markets, which remain crucial in the financing and development of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure overseen by the FCC.;N
For example, I worked on every aspect of the landmark legislation to revamp the financial services industry, the Gramm-Leach-;N
This experience provided me with great perspective on the, latest developments in a field which plays a key role in the future of the telecommunications industry.;N
Moreover, I have participated in the multi-year effort to enact bankruptcy reform, the commercial aspects of which are unfortunately playing an increasingly prominent role in the structuring of the telecommunications industry.;N
In my previous staff position for the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I undertook a number of in-depth investigations and organized a number of hearings, many of which led to changes in Federal law or reforms of executive agency practices and organizational structures.;N
This experience in exploring the depths of complex issues, and learning how to conduct Federal investigations and organize fact-finding hearings will help me, if confirmed, to evaluate the complex field of telecommunications.;N
Moreover, this oversight experience provided valuable insight into the management of large and complex Federal agencies and how to address bureaucratic problems that can have an adverse effect on the public which relies on those agencies.;N
In this position, I also learned first-hand the importance of affordable telecommunications services to senior citizens and their families.;N
I served as the primary advisor to Senators Pryor and Riegle on some of the largest programs in the Federal budget which fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee on which they served.;N
This responsibility rapidly developed my ability to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal programs, initiate specific proposals for improving them and forge a bipartisan consensus in order to get changes enacted or otherwise approved by Federal agencies.;N
This experience would aid me, if confirmed, in confronting the many challenges to the efficient functioning of the FCC.;N
My undergraduate and graduate education focused on how American history, political science, economics and public policy analysis could be employed to improve the functioning of government.;N
My political science studies at Stanford, followed by my studies there to attain a Masters in history, helped me to better understand the context in which government decisions were being made.;N
I furthered my studies at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where I gained valuable lessons in economics, statistics and public policy analysis.;N
In sum, I have had the privilege of studying and serving in capacities that have provided a unique level of experience, exposure and education about Federal Government processes, including those involving telecommunications policy.;N
I have dedicated my career to public service in the U.S. Senate, working for some of its finest members.;N
I can imagine no greater training ground to prepare an individual for the enormous responsibility of implementing the complex and often disputed telecommunications laws enacted by Congress.;N
Public service has afforded me the opportunity to make some concrete contributions to what I, and the members I served, considered to be in the public interest.;N
This country and my home State of South Dakota have given so much to me and my family that no amount of giving back in the form of public service can ever repay the gratitude I feel.;N
My father's family found safe haven here from the pogroms in Russia around the turn of the century.;N
My greatgrandmother homesteaded near the Badlands of South Dakota, and my grandfather went on from there to found a business that became one of the largest employers in the state.;N
Now, based on the extraordinary opportunities and education I have been afforded in the Senate and at fine educational institutions, I would like to use my experience to promote the public interest as envisioned by Congress in its communications laws.;N
The FCC has before it perhaps the most exciting challenges of any agency in promoting the development of telecommunications and information technologies and services during a time of economic difficulty in the industry and security threats to our country.;N
I would like to work toward achieving bipartisan solutions that maximize the ability of the Commission to contribute to productivity, economic growth and improved security for the entire country.;N
Having been born and raised in one of the most rural states in the country, South Dakota, and given my experience working on behalf of South Dakota for 7 years in Senator Daschle's office, I see the value of quality communications and media services in people's lives.;N
My experience has taught me that these services can make a positive contribution to economic development, education, public safety, and the quality of health care services available to people in need.;N
In rural areas like the one where I was raised, the availability of the most advanced communications technology can determine whether a small community can offer an economic future to its citizens, and can even mean the difference between life and death in the case of medical emergencies.;N
It is also clear that enhancing the quality of the nationwide telecommunications infrastructure improves the overall economy by increasing the productivity and efficiency of the entire nation.;N
If confirmed, serving at the Commission will provide me with an opportunity to promote the transforming power of communications and media services in people's lives.;N
The FCC has been charged by Congress with a key role in fostering competition, innovation and universal service.;N
Advanced technologies can connect people to new opportunities and obliterate the distances between them.;N
They can contribute to our quality of life, and keep this country competitive in the global economy.;N
If confirmed, I will work with the other Commissioners and the many talented people at the Commission to help improve the telecommunications economy and promote the deployment of the most advanced technologies to every region and sector of American society, as envisioned by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.;N
If confirmed, my goals are to work toward expanding access to telecommunications services for all Americans, including broadband services, to help restore the economic vitality of the telecommunications sector, and to address emerging public safety and security needs.;N
In pursuing these goals, I will strive to faithfully carry out the communications laws enacted by Congress, consistent with Congressional intent ascertained from a plain reading of the statute and its legislative history.;N
In order to accomplish this most effectively, I will work to keep open and improve communications with Members of Congress and their staffs.;N
Working firmly within that framework, I will seek to realize the goal of improving the economic climate of the telecommunications industry, which is currently witnessing an historic downturn, so that continued innovation, investment and deployment can improve the level of services available to consumers.;N
This effort can be accomplished in part by working toward the statutory goal of the Act itself, which calls for extending the availability of advanced telecommunications technology to all Americans in all regions, including the ubiquitous deployment of broadband.;N
Finally, our country must have the most reliable and sound telecommunications infrastructure in order to meet new and emerging threats to our security.;N
Addressing the needs of the public safety community must remain at the very forefront of the Commission's agenda.;N
4. What skills do you believe you may be lacking which maybe necessary to successfully carry out this position?;N
It would be difficult for any individual to master the intricacies of all of those many areas of jurisdiction.;N
Recognizing these difficulties, despite my years of experience in this field, I will examine even more intensively the many issues arising before the Commission, taking advantage of the greater access to information available to Commission members.;N
I realize that many different challenges face the legislative branch and independent regulatory agencies of government.;N
If confirmed, in making the transition to the FCC, I will need to reach out to the many experienced and skilled public servants within the Commission.;N
Moreover, I will also draw on the experience of leading outside experts, including those in academia and public interest groups, and that of the many leaders in the telecommunications industry.;N
I will also reach out to regular consumers and residents of rural areas to learn about their perspectives.;N
Telecommunications is a rapidly changing field and I will need to refine my knowledge constantly to keep abreast of these changes.;N
I am confident this can be accomplished by drawing on the seasoned Commission staff and leading technologists from outside the agency.;N
Include a discussion of when you believe the government should involve itself in the private sector, when should society's problems be left to the private sector, and what standards should be used to determine when a government program is no longer necessary.;N
The United States was founded upon a Constitution that carefully enumerates powers available to the Federal Government, and places limits on those powers.;N
The American Revolution was largely a response to abuses of power by an unaccountable king.;N
Emerging from this beginning, the U.S. has, historically and properly, retained a skeptical view of the role of government power.;N
Most importantly, it vested responsibility for limiting the encroachment of government into the private sector and people's lives not only through the Bill of Rights, but through a sound democracy.;N
For officials in a regulatory agency such as the FCC, it is imperative not to exceed the authority delegated to the agency by Congress when applying regulations to the private sector.;N
Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and regulators must restrain themselves from using their congressionally delegated authority to exceed the limits of congressional mandates.;N
I consider the necessity for such judicial action a failure to interpret congressional intent in implementing the law and, if confirmed, would strive to avoid such failure.;N
In my view, which happens to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act, competition is preferable to regulation as a means of encouraging innovation, lowering prices and improving the quality and availability of services to consumers.;N
Some sectors of the telecommunications industry are already witnessing a competitive market, while others are still making the transition.;N
A greater government role may be needed to facilitate competition in less open markets, and government action may be necessary to stimulate service in other instances in which the market fails to address essential societal goals, such as the deployment of the advanced services to rural areas.;N
In these exceptional circumstances, to make markets work best, the government should operate in a fair, clear and open manner, establishing frameworks that are technologically and competitively neutral.;N
The goal must always be to get to the point where market forces and competition render governmental regulation unnecessary.;N
Once that point is achieved, the regulatory environment should diminish deftly and appropriately.;N
In terms of when government programs are no longer necessary, section 10 of the Communications Act provides useful guidance.;N
This provision authorizes the Commission to discontinue applying regulations that are no longer needed to prevent discrimination or other unjust practices or charges, or to protect consumers.;N
This provision specifically requires the Commission to weigh whether or not eliminating a regulation could enhance competition.;N
In general, I agree with the proposition that a program or regulation is no longer needed when the market failure it was designed to correct has been addressed.;N
For example, the government has historically promoted universal service in areas such as postal service and telephone service.;N
It has also established a national highway system, and promoted universal access to electricity.;N
In these cases, government has worked in close cooperation with the private sector to accomplish laudable goals.;N
Whenever possible, the government should attempt to work in partnership with the private sector to address policy goals in areas where competition or the market alone might not accomplish them to the satisfaction of policymakers in Congress.;N
It is a core, bipartisan American value that the government should act to secure universal service for its citizens.;N
This policy goal, when met, enhances the value of the telecommunications network for all who use it, whether as consumers or providers.;N
In your own words, please describe the agency's current missions, major programs, and major operational objectives?;N
The FCC is an independent regulatory agency created by the Communications Act of 1934 to oversee emerging communications technologies by wire and radio.;N
Its mission has been expanded by subsequent amendments to include television, satellite and cable.;N
It is charged with carrying out the responsibilities conferred upon it by Congress to help ``all the people of the United States'' benefit from the best telecommunications system possible, and to do so at reasonable rates.;N
In short, the FCC regulates radio and television broadcasters, wire common carriers, wireless and satellite communications providers, as well as multichannel video programmers, and helps coordinate international and satellite policies.;N
The FCC oversees the administration of universal service support programs, including high-;N
It enforces the Communications Act requirements in these fields and handles public inquiries and consumer complaints.;N
The FCC's mission, as detailed in the statute, is to facilitate competition, promote universal service and technological innovation, and to protect the public interest.;N
Much of its recent activities has involved implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.;N
Operationally, the FCC currently oversees a vast array of regulations that it must continually enforce and evaluate in light of changing market conditions and technological change.;N
It must also respond to input from Congress, and to any changes that Congress enacts to its current mission.;N
In reference to question No. 6, what forces are likely to result in changes to the mission of this agency over the coming 5 years?;N
The FCC's fundamental mission will change only to the extent that Congress amends the laws governing the agency, or that competition develops in a manner that obviates the need for regulation.;N
Even if such fundamental developments do not occur, however, in certain areas the agency will confront the need to respond to technological innovation, and to accommodate rising demand for spectrum and new wireless technologies, as well as to respond to significant changes in the marketplace that may emerge.;N
In further reference to question No. 6, what are the likely outside forces which may prevent the agency from accomplishing its mission?;N
While outside forces are presenting challenges to the FCC, I am hopeful none of them will prevent it from accomplishing its statutory mission.;N
One great outside challenge now facing the agency is that changes in revenue streams are placing pressure on universal service, which may complicate efforts to ensure its sustainability and to encourage the deployment of advanced services.;N
Second, increasing demands on spectrum are straining the ability of the agency to balance the need to promote the deployment of advanced wireless telecommunications services with the essential needs of national security and public safety.;N
Third, the Commission will need adequate resources to carry out its mission as the telecommunications environment grows ever more technologically complex.;N
It will be a challenge to attract and retain the best-trained specialist&in the fields of telecommunications technology, economics, and law unless resources keep pace with the demands placed on the agency.;N
In further reference to question No. 6, what factors in your opinion have kept the department/agency from achieving its missions over the past several years?;N
The agency can improve communications with Congress so that emerging problems can be addressed in the most cooperative manner possible.;N
In addition, the judicial review process has led increasingly to inconsistent interpretations of the law, in some cases due to inadequate efforts to provide objective justification for some of the regulatory positions the agency has taken.;N
There is also a need to show more dedication to expeditiously and responsively addressing section 254 of the Telecommunications Act in light of the changing nature of the marketplace.;N
The primary stakeholders are residential and business consumers of telecommunications services.;N
Congress, which created the agency, is also a primary stakeholder which is accountable and responsive to those consumers.;N
Telecommunications businesses that provide services to consumers are, of course, key stakeholders.;N
Others include the White House, related executive branch agencies, State regulators, and international governments.;N
What is the proper relationship between your position, if confirmed, and the stakeholders identified in question No. 10?;N
It must act to preserve its independence if its decisions are to be regarded as objective and fair.;N
Given this position, the agency must always keep focused on its mission, as embodied in the Communications Act, to protect consumers and promote the public interest.;N
As such, it is imperative that Commissioners maintain close communications with Congress so as to reflect most accurately its intentions with regard to the law and attend most efficiently to members' concerns as raised by their various constituencies.;N
Commissioners should work cooperatively with outside stakeholders, listen carefully to their concerns, and respond to those concerns in a manner consistent with the law.;N
Commissioners should hear and consider fully the competing visions of the many providers of telecommunications services and evaluate what outcomes would best serve the public interest as intended by the Act.;N
All stakeholders should be heard and treated fairly, but none should be granted any special treatment in terms of access or outcomes.;N
The Chief Financial Officers Act requires all government departments and agencies to develop sound financial management practices similar to those practiced in the private sector.;N
(a) What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure your agency has proper management and accounting controls?;N
If confirmed, I will consider it my responsibility to work closely with and oversee agency management and administrative personnel, and help to ensure a clean audit.;N
The Act specifies that the Chairman is to serve as the chief executive officer of the Commission, and the Commission has hired a Chief Financial Officer.;N
At the same time, all Commissioners are responsible for overseeing and assisting with the management of the agency in order to comply with statutory mandates.;N
I will seek to work closely with these officials to help establish the most effective organizational structure and the most efficient use of the budgetary resources provided by Congress.;N
In terms of what will most closely fall under my purview if confirmed, I will employ diligence and careful scrutiny in administering the resources of my office.;N
I have extensive experience in congressional oversight of large agencies, including committee oversight experience in evaluating the management of the over 60,000 employees of the Social Security Administration.;N
I also have extensive experience in the congressional budget process involving the entire Federal Government, as I have assisted Senator Daschle with those responsibilities.;N
While this differs from direct management experience of a large agency, if confirmed I will work closely with agency officials who manage the day-to-day operations of the Commission to refine the management skills I gained on the Hill in a manner consistent with its operations.;N
The Government Performance and Results Act requires all government departments and agencies to identify measurable performance goals and to report to Congress on their success in achieving those goals.;N
(a) Please discuss what you believe to be the benefits of identifying performance goals and reporting on your progress in achieving those goals.;N
All successful organizations, and people for that matter, whether in government or in the private sector, must have a plan with measurable goals in order to maximize effectiveness.;N
The GPRA, which requires a Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plans, increases the effectiveness of Federal agencies by forcing them to adopt a structure by which to measure performance goals and to help set budget priorities.;N
These measurable goals permit Congress, and the agency itself, to evaluate the progress being made toward achieving certain milestones.;N
They also help direct human and financial resources to promote the most pressing priorities.;N
Moreover, they can help determine whether certain programs and initiatives should get additional resources, fewer resources, or should be eliminated entirely.;N
(b) What steps should Congress consider taking when an agency fails to achieve its performance goals?;N
Should these steps include the elimination, privatization, downsizing or consolidation of departments and/or programs?;N
The appropriate response to agency failures would depend upon the size, significance and impact upon the public of those failures, and the degree to which it was due to factors under the agency's control, or upon external factors.;N
Depending upon these circumstances, Congress is best able to determine the appropriate response based upon its investigative and oversight powers.;N
While all the above options are available to Congress, the need for drastic measures can be minimized if the agency and Congress maintain effective communication so that would-be failures can be caught early and minimized through early corrective action.;N
(c) What performance goals do you believe should be applicable to your personal performance, if confirmed?;N
In order to judge whether I fulfill my responsibilities, if confirmed I should be evaluated as to whether I have implemented the law consistent with congressional intent in a balanced, fair and impartial manner, and done so expeditiously and with thorough attention to the details of every issue that comes before the Commission.;N
My view of managing involves identifying a core set of values and a vision, and communicating them clearly to employees.;N
Foremost among these is a dedication to serving the public interest and doing what is right for the country.;N
Setting a high standard for service in a public office, whether as an FCC commissioner or as a Senate staffer, serves to inspire employees to reach their full potential by making them realize that they are working for a cause much greater than themselves.;N
Supervisors should lead by example, both in terms of their work ethic and their communication of a vision that drives employees toward measurable goals.;N
Supervisors should maintain an open door, be frank about both successes and shortcomings of employees' performance, and give regular guidance as to how to improve performance.;N
These frank discussions are best accomplished in a collaborative setting, with incentives and opportunities to reward outstanding performance.;N
Most importantly, employees should feel empowered to achieve their highest aspirations, and should be recognized and given credit for achievements.;N
The message is always that we are all in this together, as a team, and that our successes and failures matter greatly because other people are depending upon us for, our judgment and work product.;N
I have served as a Senate staffer for the past 15 years, advancing in positions of increasing responsibility from positions with a personal staff, a committee staff, and with a leadership staff.;N
In each of these positions, I have worked regularly with congressional committees in both the Senate and the House.;N
In the Senate, I have worked particularly closely with the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.;N
Please explain what you believe to be the proper relationship between yourself, if confirmed, and the Inspector General of your department/agency.;N
The Inspector General must maintain independence from the Commissioners and all employees of the agency.;N
If confirmed, were I to observe anything which appeared to involve improprieties, I would consider it my duty to report that matter to the IG and allow the IG to conduct an autonomous investigation.;N
In addition, I would review any recommendations by the IG involving FCC activities and operations with great seriousness and act upon them to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.;N
I would offer my full support and cooperation to the IG's office and urge cooperation throughout the agency as the IG carried out its responsibilities.;N
I would not tolerate any impediments to the IG's efforts to investigate any and all operations of the Commission.;N
17. Please explain how you will work with this Committee and other stakeholders to ensure that regulations issued by your department/;N
I believe I currently enjoy an excellent working relationship with the Commerce Committee and its members on both sides of the aisle, and, if confirmed, I would strive to buildupon those relationships.;N
As I have stated, I see it as a fundamental priority to ensure that all of my activities comply with the spirit and the letter of the laws enacted by Congress.;N
If confirmed, I pledge to maintain a regular dialog with members of this committee and their staff, consistent with the agency's procedural rules.;N
I will seek regular guidance from them concerning how best to implement that statute as envisioned by the committee and by Congress.;N
I fully recognize that Congress sets the United States' communications policy and the FCC implements it, and will act accordingly in all of my relations with this Committee.;N
In areas under the department/agency's jurisdiction, what legislative action(s) should Congress consider as priorities?;N
I would not presume at this time to recommend any specific legislative actions regarding Federal telecommunications policy.;N
The agency remains involved in debating ways to carry out the substantial responsibilities vested in it by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 1 would note that the Chairman has proposed strengthening the agency's enforcement authority, and his proposals have great merit and deserve the careful attention of Congress.;N
Within your area of control, will you pledge to develop and implement a system that allocates discretionary spending based on national priorities determined in an open fashion on a set of established criteria?;N
If confirmed, I will work with the Chairman in order to set appropriate budgetary priorities and processes, and will seek to ensure the Commission has adequate resources to carry out its responsibilities to meet the national priorities established by Congress.;N
I have several questions, but I'd like to submit them to you for your consideration and response.;N
Did you happen to see the remarks of Chairman Powell, I believe, reported in the media yesterday that perhaps you may have to even see something which was unthinkable just a short time ago, that perhaps parts or all of WorldCom might be acquired by one of the Bell Companies?;N
It seems to me he's saying also that perhaps, in some aspects of telecommunication, because of the requirements for infrastructure and massive capital infusions, that perhaps it can't all be competitive.;N
Well, as one of, I think, three hardy souls who voted against the Telecommunications Act in 1996, I believe, by any measurement, it has not lived up to the promise of the Act when it was passed.;N
Now, maybe some events were out of the control of the sponsors, but the incredibly optimistic statements that were made on the floor of the Senate and in this Committee when that bill was passed have turned out, obviously, not to be true.;N
My opening question to you, ``What's the state of telecommunications industry today,'' is ample evidence that something went wrong.;N
"Now, whether it was just confined to the telecommunications industry and their behavior, or whether it was the bubble, the defiance of rational laws of investment, of unscrupulous--clearly we know there was unscrupulous executives; in fact, maybe even criminal behavior on the part of some of them--and maybe part of it was over-hyping the potential of things like broadband and how quickly they would become part of America's everyday life.";N
Now, you and I have played this game for many years, so I know that it'll be very difficult to get a definitive answer out of you, because you might make Senator Brownback mad if you did.;N
The FCC will play a major role--a major role--because we may continue to be gridlocked to a large degree here in the Congress because of--look at the different broadband bills that have been proposed, which I think is ample evidence of the divergence of views.;N
But here is a sense of urgency and a sense of priority about this issue because of its impact, not only on the economy of the United States, but, frankly, our ability to progress as a Nation because of the potential that the information technologies have in all aspects of American life and, indeed, rural life.;N
So I hope that you will recognize, as one who was heavily involved in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that it has not lived up to the expectations that were held for it at the time it was passed.;N
And if you don't believe me, go back and look at the statements that were made at the time of its passage.;N
And every group was there behind those closed doors except one group of Americans, and that was the American citizen, the ones that can't afford a lobbyist, to pay millions of dollars to represent them here in Washington.;N
But, more important, in the immediate term, we'd better look at that bill, and what its consequences were, both intended and unintended, and we'd better start to think of new and innovative ways of doing business, both here in the Congress and at the FCC.;N
The reason why I place so much responsibility on the FCC, frankly, is an admission of my pessimism of our ability to act here in Congress, because we have so many competing special interests that gridlock us time after time.;N
Big money and big-money lobbyists that are here--a bunch of them are here in this room making several hundred dollars an hour as we speak.;N
The fact is that we need to review what has happened since we passed that bill in 1996 and learn some lessons from it, because I don't know how we avoid repeating mistakes in the future unless we review what happened in the past.;N
There was no evil or malfeasance, in my view, of the people who were involved in the passage of this bill.;N
And I'd be glad to listen to any response you might have, in a general or a specific fashion.;N
We met and discussed privately some of these issues, but I just want to raise them here, as well.;N
A couple of items that the Senate is working on a great deal--overall broadband deployment, ubiquitous broadband deployment.;N
We're seeing now more bills circulating in the system to try and get more broadband out there to consumers.;N
And it's going to be a tough time where you've got capital markets devaluing telecommunications and deployments so heavily.;N
I hope that the FCC will be positively engaged in this in trying to get as much broadband out and deployed as broadly and as diffusely as possible as we wrestle with the issue here, and as the capital markets take their hit on the telecommunications field.;N
I hope you'll take a very aggressive stance on getting it out everywhere, because you'll be in a key spot, if you're confirmed, to be able to do that, even after legislation that's being considered from here.;D
We've got a lot of issues that we're starting to take and work on here on unlicensed spectrum, on spectrum management.;N
We need to back up on spectrum and come together on a comprehensive plan, a comprehensive view of that finite resource, and press on it aggressively so that we can have enough in the future deployed in the right places so that we can meet all the needs that we're going to have of our citizenry.;N
Any other tools that you could use in sponsoring and having good spectrum-management policy that you envision as a Commissioner?;N
One other issue I wanted to raise with you, it's one I mentioned to you in our meeting we had.;N
And, Mr. Chairman, if you could, I'd like unanimous consent to enter in the record a--this is a one-page summary of a study of TV violence and brainmapping in children.;N
And what it shows is the brain activity that was going on while a child watches violent entertainment, and what takes place, what parts of the brain get activated when this occurs.;N
It's a very interesting study, in that we've got about a thousand studies--I mean, truly about a thousand behavior studies, that say that kids below a certain age, if they watch violent entertainment, they become more violent.;N
This, to my knowledge, is the first set of studies where they go in and actually map what's taking place in the brain.;N
I think we're on the same path as on smoking, where, for years, people would wake up in the morning, and they had been smoking, and they were coughing, and they didn't feel good, and so they didn't think smoking was probably good for them, but they didn't know for sure.;N
And then we started watching the trail, watching the studies, and saw the links between lung cancer and other health problems, when we could actually track the physical activity that was taking place in the body because of smoking.;N
And then that really turned the tide on it and we said we really have got to discourage people from smoking.;N
Here now, we have what I think is the beginnings of the studies of the smoking gun for what's taking place with violent entertainment and its impact on kids.;N
The reason I point it out to you--and I ask that this be placed in the record--and, if you would, to look at it.;N
We license it to radios, television, but in this case I'm talking about television, and then they have to use this, according to the FCC, in the public interest.;N
And I would like for you very much to consider looking at these types of studies and asking if, during family hour, when we are trying to encourage, I would think, as much as anything, families to watch television together, is it in the public interest to have a certain level of violent entertainment?;N
But we certainly ought to be funding, I would think, a lot more studies like this to determine, not just behaviorally now, but the electrochemicals in the brain and the activities in the neurons that fire--is this in the public interest?;N
Well, this shows, in here in these studies, that when a child watches the violent entertainment--;N
in this, I think they actually showed them scenes from ``Rocky IV''--what it stimulates in the brain is the fight-or-flight area of the brain.;N
And it also stimulates the part of the brain that's for storing of significant information and--like, you know where you were September 11th.;N
It turns out, when a child watches violent entertainment, that part of the brain is stimulated and fires and starts building the patterns there.;N
And the reason that this researcher speculates that children become more violent is that the thinking, the reasoning part of the head, isn't as developed, so now, whenever they see a violent situation, their brain doesn't process it well and say, ``Well, wait.;N
They just say, ``this is a violent situation'' and react, because the thinking part of the brain isn't as developed to say, ``No, wait.;N
And we had a nice visit in our office after being pushed around a little bit on times and everything else.;N
We have hard time, it seems like, carving out times to visit about some of the very important things.;N
We talked about universal service yesterday, and we agreed that we're going to have to take some kind of an approach there in order to solve that problem.;N
And now, with the public-safety people who are deploying and ready to put a lot of new technology in place, I'm not real sure it wasn't one of the bills that we passed through here that has as much impact on public safety as anything that we've done.;N
I operate from the premise that if you find a turtle sitting on top of a fencepost, he didn't get there by himself.;N
But there was a lot of us here that understood that this was a major piece of legislation that we passed.;N
It was truly one that would be very, very beneficial to the people that work in emergency services, first responders, and people who are in rural areas.;N
I continue to be concerned--a lot of loss of life in Montana is, No. 1, after the call comes in, we can't find them.;N
But I look forward in working with you, Mr. Adelstein, and we need you in a chair down there.;N
And also I would be remiss if I didn't mention a letter I just got from Bob Rowe, our good friend who is a Public Service Commissioner out in Montana.;N
You and Mr. Rowe have worked together on a lot of issues, and I consider him one of the finest Commissioners that we've had in Montana.;D
Knowing your friendship, though, and he highly compliments you and is highly supportive of your nomination and looks forward to working with you, and so I appreciate that.;D
You can take a--it's an issue that's coming down the track, and it's got such a head of steam that, you know, no matter what is said or what is done--you know, you can go out and catch a June-bug--you know, those great big old June-bugs?;N
And you can put it in a jar and set it up on the shelf in the kitchen, and you look at that thing for 3 or 4 days.;N
Doing 90 miles and hour, and one of those rascals hit you right in the mouth, you can swallow that thing just like that.;N
Senator Burns has made a great deal of money in my State, by the way, over the years and is thankful for North Dakota.;N
"There's no reason to rehash why that's the case; but, nonetheless, today I'm pleased to support a nominee that I think will do an extraordinary job and someone the Commission desperately needs at this point.";N
I know you will, but on the issues of universal service, competition, and the things that really matter to a lot of the American people, we're going to have to rely on you to be a voice that's extraordinarily aggressive, and never give up on these issues.;N
Do you agree that, in recent years, actions have been taken by the FCC that have narrowed the base for support of universal service, and that, in fact, if we're going to have a robust universal-service support of advanced services, you have to have a broader base, not a narrower base?;N
I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but my point is, yes, a court ruled, but the ruling wasn't even appealed.;N
Well, Mr. Adelstein, it will be a breath of fresh air to have you serve on the Commission.;N
We've had a lot of wonderful people in this country's history serve in that role, but we have a Commission that is relatively inexperienced, as you know, and I'm not going to talk about any particular member of the Commission at this point, but a relatively inexperienced Commission and also a Commission that seems less aggressive in pursuing the things that we wrote in the law.;N
And that was to say that universal service support shall apply to ``advanced telecommunications services.'';N
It is going to be a breath of fresh air to have you there, and I wish you well and have high hopes for your service at the FCC and am pleased to vote for your nomination.;N
I'm certain you know that the Members of this Committee seem rather pleased with your nomination.;N
This afternoon, the Committee was to hear two nominations, that of Major General Charles Bolden to be the Deputy Administrator and Mr. Robert Cobb to be the Inspector General of NASA.;N
Instead, we will hear Mr. Cobb's nomination, as General Bolden has withdrawn his name from nomination in order to continue his military service at this time of war.;D
General Bolden is the Commanding General of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing in San Diego, California.;D
Before we begin hearing from Mr. Cobb, I will say that I believe that General Bolden would be an excellent nominee for NASA's Deputy Administrator.;D
In 1980, he was selected for an astronaut candidate for NASA, and qualified as a Space Shuttle pilot astronaut in 1981.;D
Another member of that crew is a distinguished member of our Full Committee and a member of the Subcommittee I chair, Senator Bill Nelson.;N
He also knew the job of Deputy Administrator, having served as the Assistant Deputy Administrator from 1992 to 1994.;D
I am certain that his service to NASA would have been as valuable as it continues to be in the United States Marine Corps.;D
Let me also State that I think it is very understandable that the President of the United States wants to have all hands on deck in this fight against terrorism, and he has my support, as he has the support of all Americans.;N
At the same time, I think it is critical that NASA also have all hands on deck, and I am very hopeful that the administration will move quickly to fill the position of nominee for NASA's Deputy Administrator.;N
Mr. O'Keefe, for example, has looked to a number of changes in technology policy that I think warrant thoughtful analysis, and we have learned just in the last few days that NASA has not yet ended its financial woes.;D
Its independent auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, has declined to issue an opinion on the agency's fiscal year 2001 financial statement, essentially declaring that NASA is not an agency that you can audit.;D
Now, like millions of Americans, I share the hopes and dreams of the agency for great gains and achievements in space, but there are not going to be a lot of dreams, there are not going to be a lot of gains if, in fact, you have got an agency that auditors claim is in such financial chaos that you cannot audit it, so we have got a problem here that of course is not the first time we have heard about this.;N
The General Accounting Office has cited before NASA's inability to provide documentation it needed to independently verify obligations and expenses, so it is critical that the administration move to fill the slot that Mr. Bolden would have assumed had he been confirmed.;N
We are going to work with them, as we always do in this Committee, in a bipartisan way, but with NASA charged to undertake civilian research and development involving flight activity and aeronautics and space at a critical time with a budget of nearly $15 billion, it is important that in addition to having all hands on deck in this fight against terrorism, that we have all hands on deck with respect to the programs that are under NASA's jurisdiction.;N
To further underscore the importance of this work, I would like to announce today that after we have had a chance to consult with Senator Allen and Senator McCain on the Minority side and, of course, Chairman Hollings, who has been so supportive of these programs and this work, over the next 2 months we are going to have an oversight hearing to examine some of the activities that are taking place at the agency.;N
I think this is a timely run-up to the reauthorization of the program, which expires later this year, so there are considerable questions that warrant the scrutiny of both the Full Committee and the Subcommittee I chair, and we are going to examine them.;N
Of course these financial flaws in particular stem from NASA's lack of a modern, integrated financial management system.;N
While NASA officials agree that there is a problem and have promised the new financial system will provide the necessary documentation, we do have to note that this is NASA's third attempt since 1988 to integrate its financial systems.;N
The first two attempts were abandoned after 12 years, and spending a reported $180 million, and Mr. Cobb, whose nomination we will consider today, is going to have an important role in straightening out those systems once and for all, and it is vital that the agency does so.;N
The agency's financial problems threaten its future, threaten the great tradition of research and development that produces technologies that will drive our economy.;N
I look forward to working with Mr. Cobb and with Administrator O'Keefe on many of the issues facing the agency.;N
During Mr. O'Keefe's confirmation hearing before the Committee, I challenged him to return NASA to a science and research-;N
driven agenda so that our dedicated scientists and engineers can find the breakthrough technologies that have been NASA at its best.;N
To follow through on that vision, it will be critical that the Inspector General be a watch-dog, ensuring that the agency's financial problems do not recur under Administrator O'Keefe's watch.;N
A few weeks ago, the beginning of March, PriceWaterhouseCoopers puts out their independent audit of the agency for fiscal year 2001, and basically their conclusion is that you cannot audit the place, that things are so out of control with respect to a lack of financial documentation for some of the agency's transactions that they basically are saying it is not auditable.;N
Given the fact that you are getting started, and this is just to get a sense of how you are going to proceed, how are you going to go drain the swamp?;N
How are you going to get after it the day you get confirmed, given that this is an embarrassment, to use your words?;N
Now, the Act, the Inspector General Act spells out essentially the duties of the Inspector General, and obviously there are legitimate questions in terms of allocating your time, but clearly part of those duties include conducting and supervising independent and objective audits and investigations relating to agency programs and operations.;N
You have already said to me and elsewhere you are not an accountant, but clearly there is going to be a need for a tireless fiscal watch-dog to get the agency in financial shape and ensure that it stays in shape.;N
Now, is that going to be the sole focus of what you do to try to get the place in financial shape, or are there other steps that you think are warranted right now?;N
Let us talk for a minute about the integrated financial management concept, how this is NASA's third attempt since 1988 to put this together.;N
The first two attempts, 12 years time, reported $180 million, the agency expects to complete the current system effort by 2007 at a cost of $645 million.;N
Can you tell us what you would do, as Inspector General, to help end this marathon exercise and actually achieve a useful, integrated financial system?;N
He and I work in a very bipartisan way on all of these issues, and I appreciate all of his involvement.;N
My inclination, I think, is I will ask these questions quickly, and then just turn it over to you for both a statement and any questions.;N
With respect to computer security, the former Inspector General was recognized as an individual who had a great interest in computer fraud and computer security.;D
You have got some very good forensic analysts who have been critical in developing cases against hackers who have attacked systems at NASA and other Government agencies.;N
How are you going to approach computer security questions, and in particular make sure that the expertise that has been developed at the agency is continued?;N
I think when you look at the history of the agency and the debate about the agency and its priorities, one of the things that you always hear, it is a recurring kind of theme, is that any time you go after expenditures, and particularly areas where there is documented waste and inefficiency, somebody says, ``Well, you are going to hurt safety, this is going to be bad for safety.'';N
As I said at Mr. O'Keefe's confirmation hearing, in my view cutting fat does not mean cutting corners on safety, and I have just got to believe that NASA has got the talent to come up with new ways of doing things, new ways of making the agency more efficient, that are also safe ways of doing them.;N
One of the things that was striking is, you have had a great interest over the years in risk management, and innovation.;D
How do you approach this question of trying to strike the balance where you come up with new ways of approaching issues and solving problems while at the same time not compromising the safety that all of us care about for the patriots who serve our country?;N
I was meeting on another technology subject, and I was listening to the questions you were asking.;N
I want to make a brief opening comment about this position and NASA generally and get some of your views on it, Mr. Cobb.;N
Folks of South Carolina must have been very forgiving if you had someone who served in the Maine infantry during the War between the States and elected family members in all sorts of positions, and so you certainly have bloodlines who have served remarkably throughout the history of our country, not just then, but subsequent as well.;N
In this hearing I think it is important for us not to look at the past, but to look at the future, and the future of our country will be in large part due to our advancements and leadership in the area of technology, and particularly where NASA is involved, the first day of aeronautics, much of what you would be doing is looking at the efficiency and cutting back on waste and so forth, and that is a very important principle.;N
We need to be looking for scientific excellence, and you will get more excellence as you have more money actually being utilized for something productive and useful, and new developments, new technologies, whether it is civilian or military.;N
We have had hearings previously with Mr. O'Keefe and last year as well on the fine, outstanding people who work at NASA.;N
The greatest resource of NASA is the people, and we need to make sure that we keep that in aeronautics and in space, and keep that fiscal responsibility with the taxpayer's dollars.;N
Now, as far as aeronautics, I think it is absolutely essential, even after September 11, for us to make sure that we do keep our lead, but we had a hearing last year when I was actually chairman of the Subcommittee, before Mr. Jeffords went to the other side.;N
At any rate, it was on the issue of aeronautics research, and there was a lot of concern about our technological edge in aeronautics being challenged, for example, by the Europeans, and the aviation industry, if you look at the importance of the aviation industry to our country, it is a net exporter.;N
It is one of our best exporting aspects for balance of trade, and obviously our preeminence is important for good-paying jobs in our country.;N
Now, NASA's aerospace technology enterprise and the Langley Research Center, they are engaged in developing innovative technologies, many of which have been adopted, and they are beneficial for the aviation industry, and their research is not just revolutionary, it is also evolutionary in the way that they look at it, and whether that is for advanced warning of wind shear, or designing advanced traffic management systems, which I know the chairman and I both share a great concern about, and that is exactly one of the things that are needed.;N
I am glad Reagan National is finally getting fully operational, but there are technologies that can help us with our security, and NASA is involved in some of that research, as well as developing what are called morphing wing vehicles for future aviation use.;N
It will reduce accidents and fatalities, obviously, and I look forward to working with you as Inspector General to ensure that the aeronautics program is run efficiently to maximize the return of the taxpayer's investment.;N
Now, to the extent you get in, and I know you are answering questions, and I saw your comments as far as the Space Station, there is a concern that all the cost overruns at the Space Station are, of course, eating away, or taking away from other very important missions of NASA in the aeronautics and other space endeavors in research, and so what you do, making those very important decisions and recommendations to us and to the administration as to what is worthwhile, what is going to get us the most use for our dollars, or where there could be improvements would be very closely listened to and I think will be very important.;N
I would be interested in hearing how you would suggest that NASA address the issues regarding human capital, if you could, because one thing that also came up out of those hearings last year on aeronautics is that the age of the people who are working in NASA, many of the engineers and scientists are--they are not right next to retirement, but they are generally older, and not that far from retirement, and when you lose that sort of capacity, when you understand that the human capital is the greatest asset of NASA, and that experience and knowledge and capability, how are we going to be able to attract more--;N
obviously, I would think you would need to work with the colleges and the universities, also in the private sector, to attract people into that research, seeing a worthwhile endeavor, or a fulfillment of a life work and also as a career for an individual.;N
I would hope that you would have some ideas as to how we can work to attract the best to be those innovators for the future, which is good for our country, good for our quality of life, good for our security, and clearly also vital for our economy as well.;N
Well, I would say, Mr. Chairman, I have read through Mr. Cobb's qualifications, more than just his genealogy, and I find this gentleman to be more than qualified, in fact highly qualified.;D
I think you are going to have probably one of the tougher jobs, but also the most important job.;N
You have the qualifications, you have the background, you have the learning, and the experience, but in your answer in the midst of it, while just trying to determine what are your principles, I think you most importantly have an understanding of how important it is that NASA be run as properly as possible.;D
That is just the nature of scientific research and development matters, but I do think that the public's confidence and the credibility of NASA is important as we make decisions, and also I think you respect the role that the elected people have, those of us in the Senate, in making decisions based on information, that I think that the information we receive from you will be credible.;N
It will not be gilded, it will be straightforward, and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Cobb, and thank you for your continuing service to your country.;D
I thank my colleague, and he makes a number of points that I agree with, and in fact I think the only other question I have would really pick up on an area you touched on, and that is really the sort of evaluative process.;N
I mean, you are going to be there, and you are going to be trying to conduct some of these evaluations and assessments in areas that do not lend themselves to kind of cookie-cutter kinds of approaches, and I would be curious, just by way of how you think through these issues, what kind of evaluative processes do you think would be appropriate for areas like R&D?;N
I mean, that is an area that both of us are strongly supportive of, and we are going to support investments in this area and have already in many areas of science and technology policy, and at the same time we have got to explain to the people of Virginia and the people of Oregon who are putting their money out, what they are getting for it.;N
Tell me, if you would, how you might go about getting your arms around evaluating R&D expenditures.;N
The two of us are going to continue the bipartisan tradition and support you, and we are going to work to get you confirmed, and I think you will speak very well for our Government, and your work, as Senator Allen noted, is especially important right now, so Godspeed.;D
Mr. Chairman, I am honored to be here today to support someone for whom I have a tremendous respect.;N
I have worked closely with the nominee for many, many years, particularly when he was over working for Bud Schuster, and I have to tell you, I have the highest regard for him.;D
Last week, I sent a letter to the Committee urging the Committee to confirm Roger Nober as a member of the Surface Transportation Board, and I am very honored to be here with my colleague, who has a very deep interest in surface transportation issues, and I am just thrilled, frankly, that he will be named Chairman of that Commission by the President;N
But in the transportation field, there is an old saying that there are no Republican bridges, there are no Democratic roads, or vice versa, and I think Roger is really proof of that.;N
Roger had a great working relationship, it could not have been better, in working with my office and my staff along with Senator Warner and Congressman Tom Petri and others who are interested in surface transportation issues.;D
He has been a kindred spirit and is an outspoken defender of the Highway Trust Fund and a proponent of the importance of transportation in general.;D
We have a transportation situation that is similar to many other problems of many other states, and that is with respect to our grain growers and shippers who are having a tough time making ends meet and working out good deals with the railroads to get their products to market.;N
Senator Burns, my colleague and a Member of this Committee, and I introduced a bill to try to deal with these problems.;N
I know Roger is fairly sympathetic, and so I will not take any more of the Committee's time.;N
I commend the President for his well-thought-out selection and, Mr. Chairman, it is with the highest regard that I support, along with my colleagues, and introduce to this Committee Roger Nober, because he is, I think, going to be a great credit, frankly, to this Nation.;N
Thank you very much, Senator Baucus and, of course, I thank our colleagues, who would be excused if they so desire, after they make their comments.;N
That was a beautiful introduction, given by my long-time friend and fellow colleague in the world of transportation and other things, Max Baucus.;N
Out of deference to you, I am not going to read my prepared statement, because I could not do any better, or make it any more heartfelt.;N
This is an incredible individual here, because I at that time was Chairman of this Subcommittee on our Committee, and Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee and I, the three of us worked as a team with your former Chairman, and you, my good friend, and we put together one of the most historic pieces of legislation that I have been privileged to work on in my 24 years in the Senate.;D
I think at this point maybe we ought to ask Roger to introduce his lovely family, who are right behind him.;N
I appreciate your holding this hearing because I would like to see David Laney get through the Senate before the recess.;N
It seems like every week we wake up to a new one, and I cannot think of anyone more qualified to sit on the Amtrak Board than David Laney.;N
David graduated from Stanford University and received his law degree from SMU, Southern Methodist University.;N
In Dallas, he has been a managing partner of Jenkins and Gilchrist, a very prestigious national law firm, and for 12 years he also served as a gubernatorial appointee in Texas.;D
He was appointed to the Texas Finance Commission and later to the Texas Transportation Commission.;D
As Chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission, he functioned basically as the CEO of the Texas Department of Transportation.;N
That is a major state agency in Texas, with 14,000 employees and a $5 billion annual budget.;N
As you might know, coming from Louisiana, we have great highways in Texas and we have more of them than any other state in America, so this really has given David Laney a lot of experience in managing a big agency.;N
Now, that is not to say he is going to replace the CEO, but certainly the CEO needs a lot of help from the Board and from experienced business people.;D
I am a supporter of Amtrak and I have worked with Members of this Committee to support Amtrak, but we cannot keep putting Band-Aids on Amtrak.;N
We need to recognize that Amtrak is a national passenger rail system that serves a vital function as one of our types of intermodal transportation.;N
I hope that we will be able, through good people like David Gunn and like David Laney, to save Amtrak and put it on a course where it can succeed, grow, and attract the passengers that it would if it were on a solid financial footing.;D
I think the important thing is looking for ways to assure solid financial footing in order to make it a strong national system.;N
You know, after 9/11, a lot of people took Amtrak, and they were looking for alternative modes of transportation to air.;N
I think now that almost a year has passed, we know that rail should be a permanent part of our intermodal transportation system in America, and I cannot think of anyone more qualified to be helpful in that regard than David Laney.;N
Thank you very much, Senator Hutchison, for your participation and assistance in these very important areas.;N
Before we hear from our two nominees and give them a chance to make an opening statement and introduce their families or associates that are with them, I would like to recognize any of our Committee Members for any comments they may have.;N
We have, since last September, had an opening on the Democratic seat on the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC.;N
I say to those who hold these things up that we need that rural voice on the Federal Communications Commission, and we need it now, but I am not going to hold up other nominations because of it.;N
But I say to my colleagues who do hold up these nominations, we need that person on the FCC right now.;N
"Mr. Chairman, I hope you will agree with me that--and this is not anything we have been involved in--we need to find our colleagues on the Senate who are holding these up, and say to them that we are not going to hold your nominations up; and we do not expect you to hold ours up.";N
Now, having said all that, Mr. Laney, the Amtrak issue is a very important issue to me and to many Members of the U.S. Senate, and I am a strong believer in having a national rail passenger system.;N
The two of you would be on the board, as I understand it, so I am pleased to support your nomination.;N
I know the Chairman will ask you to introduce them more formally, but it is nice to see your family with you as well.;N
I appreciate your scheduling this in a timely way, and just a few comments for each of our nominees, because I, too, am only going to be able to be here briefly.;N
Let me also say, I have only heard positive things about both of you individuals, and certainly it is my intent to support both of you, but let me just share briefly with you several concerns I have.;N
I think your questions were excellent, Mr. Chairman, and highlighted a number of important issues.;N
Well, I would urge you, and I will make sure you have a copy, to look at it, because it is really scathing in terms of its criticism of how Amtrak goes about making decisions.;N
They said with respect to the network growth strategy that Amtrak was proceeding in a speculative way.;N
They said again, and I will quote, ``Amtrak did not obtain a full understanding of freight railroad concerns.'';N
I would like to begin by seeing if you agree with my judgment that it is time for a shift in Amtrak policy so that decisions are based on objective criteria.;N
We can have a debate about what those objective criteria ought to be, and I think that is an appropriate thing to discuss, but I want us to go there as a public policy goal, to set out objective criteria.;N
I think that is fair, and I am going to interpret that as a yes, with exactly the kind of qualification that is appropriate.;N
I think that is a very reasonable orientation, and something on which we ought to have a debate.;N
What I am concerned about is the politicizing of these routes, as we have seen again and again.;N
We have communities in rural Oregon that have done everything except hold bake sales in order to fund Amtrak service.;N
They have agreed, for example, to levy per capita assessments on their constituents, so they understand that this is not the transportation policy of yesteryear where we are just going to heave money every which way and hope some of it works.;N
In the Amtrak markup that we considered earlier in the year, I sponsored an amendment to require that Amtrak's Board of Directors and top management comply with the same ethical standards as federal officials and employees.;N
My concern has been that there has been a double standard, and particularly at Amtrak, a kind of revolving door which favors the East Coast of the United States, frankly, where people go back and forth on various parts of the East Coast of the United States, and it certainly gives the appearance, at a minimum, of having a bias in favor of those East Coast routes.;N
It stands ready to come before the Senate floor, and I would be interested in your position as to whether the same sort of ethical standards that are required of federal officials and employees ought to apply in the positions at Amtrak.;N
I was concerned particularly that the head of Amtrak essentially spent all of his time in New Jersey, then went to the regional office, then went to the head of Amtrak, and now is back in New Jersey.;N
He certainly at the time was making decisions that involved routing as it related to the East Coast of the United States.;N
As a result of that, I did a review of the statutes in this area, and I found that there were not the same ethical requirements for officials on these Amtrak positions as there were for other federal officials.;N
So on a unanimous basis this Committee agreed to the amendment that I have just described this afternoon, and that is something I feel strongly about.;N
It is only fair that you have a chance to read it, but I would be interested in knowing as a general principle whether you think the same ethical strictures that apply to federal officials generally should apply in positions like the one in which you are being considered.;N
By getting unanimous support for the amendment in the Committee, I made it clear that I am not accusing anybody of any crimes or anything of the sort.;N
I have no quarrel with the proposition that there is a lot of expertise in the Northeast part of the United States.;N
But when these routes are being made, people are negotiating about aspects of routing that can affect their future employment, certainly it gives the appearance of impropriety.;N
I think Senator Breaux covered very well the question of competition among railroads, and I thought your answers were helpful there.;N
On the question of Class I carriers, and this touches particularly on the short line railroad issue, what are your thoughts regarding the appropriateness of Class I carriers determining what the route of a short line carrier can offer the customers through the methods that I essentially described in my opening statement?;N
The other question I had is, the small volume shippers are generally exasperated about the process.;N
They look at the existing rate complaint process and say, it is complicated and almost too uncertain to be of any real value.;N
I gather that nobody has ever even filed a case, not one, under the STB small rate case guidelines.;N
I would be interested in knowing whether you share some of these concerns, and what you think you might be able to do to alleviate the concern of the small shipper as it relates to resolving rail disputes.;N
Again, like the ethical discussion I was having with Mr. Laney, I was pretty amazed that nobody had ever filed a case under the STB small rate case area because it seemed so complicated.;N
Today the Committee considers the nomination of Dr. John Marburger for Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and to serve as the President's Science Advisor, and the nomination of Mr. Phillip Bond to be the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.;N
We will give these two distinguished individuals a more formal introduction in just a few moments, and we are also pleased to have a number of our colleagues from the House, particularly my old friend Chairman Sherwood Boehlert here with us today, and Sherry, we are very pleased that you are here as well.;D
Since the attacks of September 11, the role of science and technology has become even more important than ever before.;N
Just yesterday, some news organizations were reporting that anthrax from American labs was sent to Iraq in the 1980's as part of a scientific effort.;N
While the report did not mention Government involvement in this effort, the inherent risk of such action is unmistakable.;N
I am of the view that it is important that intellectual security be seen as an integral part of any national security approach.;N
Given the possibilities for the misuse of science, I also see tremendous potential in harnessing science and technology in a protective effort, from developing the technology to direct airplanes from a control tower instead of a cockpit, to using science to quickly develop antidotes and vaccines to potential bioterrorism agents, taxpayer money can be smartly invested in advances that ultimately reward and benefit the safety and peace of mind of all Americans.;N
We intend to look very closely at what happened on September 11 with a mind toward making sure the preventive steps are in place so as to do everything possible to eliminate the prospect of such tragedies again, and also to take those steps to try to repair and recreate a damaged technology infrastructure.;N
I proposed in recent days what I have called the technology equivalent of the National Guard, made up of the brains and talent in this country's leading technology companies, that have indicated to me and other Members of Congress that they would be happy on essentially a volunteer basis to step in and try to both prevent such tragedies and to repair and recreate damaged communication systems.;N
Suffice it to say that while these companies made Herculean efforts after September 11 to help, sending people and equipment and resources to New York City, it is now quite clear that there are many significant gaps in the way these matters are handled.;N
For example, yesterday, in meetings that I held at home in Portland, Oregon, I was advised by many of the leaders in our technology companies that they and others had tried to donate people and equipment in New York City to try to respond to the problems, and New York City just was not set up to handle it.;N
I came away with a feeling that if nothing else was done in this country but to set up a clearinghouse where you could readily get the information about the brains and the equipment and the companies and the people who could assist in the event of such tragedies, that that alone would be a very valuable contribution.;N
This Subcommittee intends to hold hearings on the situation in New York City in terms of the response on the technology side very soon, perhaps as soon as next week, and we are looking forward to exploring a variety of the proposals that have been made with respect to both the private and the public sector.;N
While we work to coordinate with the private sector to respond to threats, coordination in the public sector is also required to prevent terrorist threats from becoming a reality.;N
The General Accounting Office recently released a troubling new report entitled, ``Combatting Terrorism''.;N
One of the sections of the General Accounting Office report dealt with a lack of coordination among science agencies in conducting counterterrorism research.;N
For example, it found that the Coast Guard was conducting research on detection of chemical attacks on cruise ships, and was unaware of similar research being conducted by the Defense Department.;N
The General Accounting Office recommended development of a strategic plan for research and development on the counterterr-;N
orism front that would prevent duplication and leverage our resources, and so we intend to ask you, Dr. Marburger, about how you would participate in the development and execution of such a plan.;N
Obviously, to put such a plan together, it will have to be closely coordinated with new Office of Homeland Security.;N
Sherry Boehlert, Tom Ridge and I teamed up quite often over the years on these kinds of issues involving science and technology policy, and I think he is going to do a superb job in that position, but one of the keys to his success will be to coordinate the 40 or so agencies involved in antiterrorist activity, and one of the things we intend on this Subcommittee to look at is the possibility of convening a meeting among the technology officers of the pertinent intelligence divisions, Tom Ridge's Office of Homeland Security and congressional leaders to look at ways for technology to assist in coordinating and sharing intelligence in a safe and secure way, and determine how the Congress can be most helpful to the administration in achieving that outcome.;N
Finally, one last area that I have had a special interest in over the years is to ensure that science policy and science and technology issues are addressed so as to promote sound science, real science as apart from junk science, and one of the things that we intend to do is to try to look and see whether it may be possible to define a set of core principles that would be used to try to best identify what constitutes sound science.;N
There are obviously some ideas that already come to mind, such as ensuring, for example, that there is thorough peer review of scientific judgments.;N
Dr. Marburger, I intend to explore with you, as well, some of your ideas about how, at a time when science is more important than ever before, we can see if we can come up with some principles that will help to guide us and keep us away from junk science that is dictated perhaps more by parochial or boardroom decisions than real scientific merit.;N
We are anxious to hear from our colleagues in the House, but first I am very pleased that Senator Brownback is here.;N
He has had a great interest in these issues over the years as well, and we would be happy to hear from you.;D
I appreciate the comments, and appreciate that you are doing this and putting this hearing in front of the rest of the Senate.;N
We are considering two of the President's nominations, and very important I consider science and technology positions, Phillip Bond to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, and John Marburger to be Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
Both Mr. Bond and Mr. Marburger are clearly qualified to fulfill the responsibilities of these positions, and I look forward to getting them into office just as soon as possible.;D
Certainly, with everything that has transpired since September 11, I think it is safe to say that the importance of these positions will be underscored as Congress seeks to address matters of an urgent nature and square away the budget.;N
Working in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, both of these positions will play an important role in certain areas where Congress is perhaps not as disposed to act, for obvious reasons, and I say that in reference to the telecommunications industry we have had some difficulties in deploying certain technologies in telcom.;N
It is bad for consumers, and it is bad for the economy, and we are going to need to right that ship, and you are going to be in positions to help influence that policy creation and implementation.;N
In my view, the state of the industry today indicates that the creation of a national broadband policy is important and long overdue.;N
As we in Congress continue to address the budget, and the immediate priorities associated with the war on terrorism, I urge you gentlemen to engage your colleagues in Government and to seek to create a broader national dialog on spurring technology, technology development--particularly the broadband deployment that I think can be a very important part of our technology growth and our communication--and our infrastructure for security in this country.;N
I do not anticipate there will be any problem in getting you cleared on through and into these positions.;N
It is important that you get there and you get there soon to engage the battle front, and I welcome you here.;N
I just want to say to my old friend Sherry Boehlert that I am delighted to see him, and you have got such an important position now in the House as Chairman of the Science Committee.;D
I am glad you are here on behalf of these gentlemen, and just by way of introduction I would say that OSTP is one of the most important appointments in the Federal Government.;N
For example, one thing that you would have some influence over is the conundrum that is now faced by NASA, where the Chairman has a hearing on this in all of the cost overruns on the space station, the starvation diet that NASA is being put on, actually delaying or canceling the safety upgrades for the space shuttle, and his hearing on this was the first week of September.;N
Well, now after September 11, we do not have a choice, because we have to have assured access to space, and your risk factor for catastrophic failure on something like the Titan is 1 in 20.;N
Your only assured access to space then would be the shuttle, until they could get the EELV's, but none of them have been flown, so the assured access to space now takes a whole new importance, and a dimension, and OSTP is clearly in a position to influence that.;N
Now, I have spoken directly with Chairman Boehlert and my old friend, now the Vice President, about this, but he needs, and others in the administration--and this is just one thing we are talking about, Mr. Bond.;N
In the area of space commercialization, you know, there was at one point this rush to say that people were going to put platforms at sea, right on the equator, and we were going to launch so we did not have to pay the fuel penalty.;N
Well now, look at the vulnerability of those platforms to terrorist activity, when you have to have assured access to space with regard to commercial ventures, which now become so important to us from the standpoint of national and international security.;N
So there again, you have a very important position with regard to making sure that all of this commercial activity of getting to space does not leave the United States.;N
So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me join in and giving my 2 cents, and to say also hello to Chairman Boehlert.;N
Thank you, Senator Nelson, and obviously we are very pleased you are on this Subcommittee as a passionate advocate for these space issues, and you raise the critical concerns for the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
I am going to offer a brief introduction and then turn it over to Senator Allen, who, like myself, has a special relationship with Phil Bond, and then we are going to turn it over to our colleagues from the House as well.;N
Dr. Marburger is a physicist by training and has had a long and distinguished career in science, most recently as Director of the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory.;D
Dr. Marburger came and met with me early on, and we expect him to play a major role in the Office of Science and Technology Policy with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, known as PCAST, and with the council's president, Floyd Kvamme, who I respect very much, and so we welcome you as well.;N
We also have Mr. Phillip Bond, who is nominated to be the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.;N
He is joined today by his wife, Dianne, and his daughters Jacqueline and Jessica, and hopefully we can get the Bond delegation to stand.;N
Welcome, and Mr. Bond is a distinguished graduate of Linfield College, in my home State of Oregon.;D
Northwest members of the congressional delegation I think have been tripping over themselves to introduce Phil Bond.;N
We are going to make her statement of support a part of the hearing record in its entirety, and we expect Phil Bond to play a major role on technology questions, be it Internet taxes, some of the issues we are going to be looking at with respect to responding to what happened in New York City, and we sort of consider Phil Bond an honorary Oregonian, and we are very glad you are here.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this very important nominations hearing today.;N
The Department of Commerce, technology and particularly the administration thereof, is obviously very important for our scientific and technological advancements, and that analysis is vitally needed in our Federal Government, not just for the Government but for our economy, and we have two very highly qualified individuals, capable individuals today, seeking our confirmation, which I am sure they will receive, and I do want to welcome Dr. Marburger.;D
Phil Bond is the President's nominee for the post of Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.;N
I know Secretary Evans is very interested in our competitiveness as a country, and I find technology--and I know the Chairman shares my view--I find technology to be a key for success as a Nation, and Phil Bond has the capabilities, the background, and experience to give good advice to the White House as well as to us in the House and the Senate.;D
That is where I was dropped, and then we moved around the country, but never through Oregon.;N
I was educated, my higher education was in Virginia, but Phil Bond also for the last 15 years has resided in the Commonwealth of Virginia with his wonderful wife Dianne, and I suspect that Jacqueline and Jessica were born in Virginia, is that correct?;N
Mr. Bond served several times on Capitol Hill, serving as chief of staff for both Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn of Washington, and Congressman Rob McKuen of Oregon.;D
He served also in the Department of Defense in the Reagan administration and in the first Bush administration.;D
In the latter case, Mr. Bond served as a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs with then-;D
Phil's work in the public sector is well-known, also the private sector, having worked for Hewlett-Packard, the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents all of the leaders in the technology community, and that is important, and makes him an ideal choice to be the President's principal voice on domestic and international technology issues.;D
He will also oversee the Office of Technology Policy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, otherwise referred to as NIST, the National Technical Information Service, and the Office of Space Commercialization, which I know our colleague Senator Nelson of Florida has a great deal of knowledge and interest in.;D
This position, Phil, as you well know, is going to take extensive coordination between the Government or public sector, as well as the private sector.;D
I know that you will bring your many years of private experience, your knowledge beyond your years, because you are still young, but nevertheless you have that energy, you have that knowledge, you have the experience, and thank you for coming back to service for your country and, indeed, for our economy and our quality of life in this country.;D
So Mr. Chairman, it is my great pleasure to present Mr. Phil Bond to this Committee for favorable consideration, and I thank Mr. Bond for his service.;D
You made it clear with respect to aviation technology that there are a number of areas where this Subcommittee could team up with the administration, and we are going to do that, and we appreciate that.;N
All right, let us wrap up our introductions by having the distinguished chairman of the Science Committee, Mr. Boehlert and Mr. Grucci, make their comments.;N
Sherry, thank you for an excellent presentation, and Dr. Marburger is lucky to have a passionate advocate like you, and we will continue, as you know, to work closely with you.;N
Gentlemen, I think we are at the point where you finally get to say your piece, and I am sure you are anxious to do it.;N
We will begin with you, Dr. Marburger, and my inclination is that we will have Dr. Marburger first, and then Mr. Bond next, and then we will start in with questions for both of them after the presentations.;N
Thank you, Mr. Bond, and we will just go with each Senator taking 10 minutes or so on the first round, and then I expect we will have several rounds this afternoon because of the importance of these issues.;N
Dr. Marburger, I think you heard me say in my opening statement that I found very troubling that section of the General Accounting Office report recently that dealt with the lack of coordination among science agencies in conducting counterterrorism research.;N
Specifically what they said was that the Coast Guard was conducting research on detection of chemical attacks on cruise ships, and the Coast Guard did not know of virtually identical research being conducted by the Defense Department.;N
I think it is very clear that one of the keys for you and for Tom Ridge in the days ahead is to make sure that the left hand and the right hand are having a conversation, because it is integral that this research be done.;N
I cannot conceive that a Member of the U.S. Senate would not support this research, but it is going to undermine our ability to get this work done if the General Accounting Office comes back 2 years hence and says, ``Well, as a result of the September 11 tragedy, there was an effort to beef up the Government's work with respect to chemical attacks on these defense installations, but again two agencies were heading off without making any efforts to coordinate''.;N
What do you see your role specifically being to prevent this kind of duplication that the General Accounting Office talked about in the new report?;N
In a situation like this, would it not make sense, before everybody goes off and does their own research, to essentially have a policy where the administration in concert with the Congress says, ``This is an area we want to fund, and these are the people we want to have do it'', and we not just sort of get involved after the fact?;N
What has troubled me is that it seems like we are always playing catch-up ball in trying to eliminate duplication and the lack of coordination, and so the General Accounting Office comes out and offers this report, and it is troubling Senator Allen and myself and Members of Congress, and here you are, you are just coming in.;N
This did not happen on your watch, and we ask you a question, and you say, ``By God, Senators Wyden and Allen, we are going to go out and do better coordination''.;N
I think what I would like to see on your watch is essentially an approach that would be preventive in nature, and that you, in concert with Mr. Ridge and the relevant officials, work with Senator Allen and myself and other Members of the Senate and say, ``This is what we think needs to be done, and you Members of the U.S. Senate, you have got to just walk the walk in addition to talking the talk and give us the money'', but once we do, then we can hold accountable the people who are charged with the responsibility, and we do not just keep repeating these instances where the research it is done, it is duplicative, the General Accounting Office issues a critical report, and then you have got to come in here and have a bunch of Members of the Senate carp at you.;N
The previous administration--President Clinton wrote a paper that I found very interesting.;N
In it, they basically tried to lay out, I think, an approach that says there are some issues with respect to science policy that are essentially national security questions with respect to science.;N
Some of them come to mind, obviously, like dual use of technologies and the like, and that is separate from what is considered science that would be totally divorced from terrorism and national security issues.;N
Do you share this view of the previous administration that there is really a discipline that ought to be appropriately called national security science, and if not, what would be your differences from the Clinton administration, that this document seems to have invested a considerable amount of effort and research to articulating this policy?;N
In this area, because you were not put on notice when we got together that this is something I was going to ask about, why do you not take the time to look at this particular paper and give me in writing your analysis of it, and particularly areas where you might disagree.;N
I think it is a provocative paper, and the notion that there really is a discipline known as national security science strikes me as an intriguing one.;N
I mean, clearly an investment in science and technology is absolutely key to military preparedness.;N
That would be another example that would come to mind, and I would like you to look at that paper.;N
Let me turn now to this question of the response to September 11 from the standpoint of technology.;N
People would call and say, ``We are walking the streets as if we were in an undeveloped Nation, looking for our relatives'', and people were posting pictures and signs all over New York City.;N
I mean, it struck me, for example, that if medical authorities and medical personnel had put a GPS bracelet on people right at the outset, that would have been a chance, for example, to use technology in a very modest sort of way to prevent some of the frustration that families and loved ones were facing, and I think there is an opportunity here to do a significantly better job in terms of mobilizing the brains and the talent and the energy in the private sector to both prevent these kinds of tragedies, and second, to move quickly by way of the first response to deal with them, and this Subcommittee is going to look at this.;N
Senator Allen has been very interested in this, and by the way, we do not see this as setting up some big Government kind of program.;N
I mean, if you have something which resembled a technology version of the National Guard, where you had at the ready the brains and the equipment and the talent and a clearinghouse where people could go to get this assistance, I think we could make vastly better use of all of this energy and creativity in the private sector, and I would like to know at the outset what you think about coordinating a better approach between the Government and the private sector to both preventing these problems and moving to respond when you have them.;N
Let me give you a handful of ideas that the high technology companies gave to me yesterday at home in Portland, because I had a session with Intel and IBM and many of the technology leaders, the wireless firms and others, and here are some suggestions they gave me, and I would be curious about your reaction to them.;N
They talked about the need for better coordination of existing data networks so there would be a way to communicate in the time of an emergency.;N
They talked about the idea of a clearinghouse, a one-stop process to access people and equipment, where people could go to get the brains and the equipment to deal with an emergency, and the frustration that they found when that was not available.;N
They talked about the heed for ways in which high-tech companies could share information, share information about their various services without running afoul of the antitrust laws, and there are some real legal questions with respect to how they do that.;N
Would these be the kinds of issues that you would zero in on as our science policy leader, and my reason for asking is not that you subscribe to every detail, but we have, as Senator Allen--I think it is fair to say Virginia and Oregon are in the lead nationally in terms of technology policy.;N
We had really some of the premier technology executives spend a couple of hours with me yesterday to talk about some of these ideas, and these were some of their suggestions, and I think it would send a real message if you as the Science Advisor said, ``These are the kinds of things I want to work on'', or maybe, ``I want to work on this'', and something else is more important.;N
Maybe there are things that you think make sense in addition, but I would be curious as to your response to that.;N
I have just one other area I want to talk about with you on this first round, and then I am going to recognize my friend Senator Allen, but on this point, and I had a chance to talk about it with Mr. Bond a little bit, the Subcommittee is going to hold hearings, hopefully as soon as next week, on this issue of how the technology sector responded on September 11, and I want to make it clear that my goal at this opening kind of round of hearings is to look at all of the ideas that are out on the table.;N
In other words, I have talked about the idea of a technology version of the National Guard.;N
Since we have begun these discussions, and I spoke about it on the floor, scores of people have contacted us with ideas that sound very creative and very good, and I think it is our goal at the first round of hearings to really get a cross-section of the ideas out on the table, and see if we can find common points of agreement between these various efforts that are going on in the private sector, and then look to see how we can work together to deal with it, and as I indicated to Mr. Bond, this is going to have to be something that ultimately the executive branch and the President of the United States would have to lead, and that is why we are looking forward to working closely with you too, and Tom Ridge, in doing that, and our past history augers will for that kind of cooperative effort.;N
I want to talk about on this first round, if I could, with you, Dr. Marburger, is the question of coming up with some principles to try to guide scientific decisions, and I am not talking here, again, about passing some kind of law, or creating a Government program, but given the importance of scientific policymaking, ensuring that is done on the basis of merit, and not from corporate boardrooms, and people with agendas that are more junk than science.;N
I wanted to ask you about a handful of principles that have really struck me as central to coming up with sound science, and get your reaction to those, and you may have other ones, and you may think this is completely off-base altogether.;N
The first that I mentioned is that sensible science should be consistent with the majority of findings as published in peer-reviewed literature.;N
That is a thoughtful answer, and I am asking these questions because I want to see how you are going to approach them, and suffice it to say, ``I think it would be just dead wrong to say that a brilliant idea cannot advance in America because it does not satisfy peer review analysis''.;N
A second principle that--as I talked with leaders in the field--has been important has been scientific inclusions and policy should satisfy the standards of good practice published by scientific societies, or organizations.;N
Again, that is a thoughtful answer, and one that I think fleshes out a little bit of what I am trying to do.;N
I want to see if we can work together with you to try to bring some light to the science questions that in many respects have become a kind of political football, and not something that really in the majority of cases addresses these questions of peer review and sound methodology and the like.;N
A third area that we have heard continually cited is that the principles used to support scientific policy should be acceptable to a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.;N
The fourth principle advanced was that policy should be derived from a broad range of studies and not based on a single set of findings.;N
The last question deals with essentially backing up a theory, can something actually be supported, and I think a lot of scientists see this as a question of whether empirical data supports the findings of predictive models.;N
I am going to recognize Senator Allen, and then I will have some questions for you, and we have not even gotten started with you yet, Mr. Bond, but on this point, Dr. Marburger, I hope that, given the importance of science as it relates to policymaking at a time when there are not very many scientists in the U.S. Congress, and there are not very many researchers, and we are dependent on outside sources for scientific information to make these policy decisions, I hope that on your watch, when you hang them up, that one of the things that you will have helped to do would be to have helped the Congress and the administration, working together, to decipher the lines between sound science and junk science when making policy decisions.;N
That is what I see to be a real priority on your watch, because it affects an array of issues which now, whether it is stem cell research, global climate change, or dominating most of what we talk about when we are not dealing with terrorism and the events of September 11.;N
I think someone of your stature and someone like yourself, who has commanded so much respect in the scientific community, and obviously with Members of Congress already, can make a real difference here in terms of helping us set out some principles and some processes, not laws and programs, but principles for making sure that we are driving science policy on the basis of scientific merit and not something that comes from a corporate set of interests, or junk science.;D
I would make a few remarks, and then I will let Dr. Marburger take a break and I will work over Mr. Bond.;N
Both these gentlemen and their agencies that deal with science are going to be very important in technology for our future.;N
I have said on many occasions as well that our laws, our permitting, our regulations ought to be based on sound science, not political science, and too often we do not listen to the actual sound science, and you and the folks that you work with and the agencies for which you all have responsibility will be very important to us in the area of biotechnology and in technology generally.;N
I always remember what de Toqueville once said about the United States, and I kind of paraphrase it.;N
He said, ``In America the only things that have not been done are those that have yet to be imagined'', and I am one who very much dislikes limits, and we should only be limited by our imagination, our ingenuity, our hard work, and indeed, in the area of biotechnology, much, virtually anything can be done, but there does need to be ethical standards, and those are tough decisions, but I think it is very important that we do listen to the scientists, to the physicians, to the technologists, to determine what are the facts, and then they should make the decisions, we should make the decisions, but nevertheless it should be based on sound science, and I very much agree with your comments in that regard.;N
The other matters I will get into as far as coordination of data networks and so forth, which I do think will be important, but that is another matter.;N
I would like to quote back to you, Mr. Bond, your statement that--you did not go through your whole statement, but this really is very much a part of what is great, and the great potential of our country, in that in your written statement that you submitted, that you state that it is no accident that the United States leads the world in high technology, both civilian and defense.;N
Our achievements are the dividends that flow from sustained public and private sector investments in research and development, coupled with America's entrepreneurial spirit and the willingness to take risks.;N
Today, the private sector plays a dominant role in the process of developing new technologies and bringing them to market.;N
The Federal Government plays a pivotal role in creating the climate that supports the private sector's efforts.;N
In other words, the Government's role is to create the conditions precedent for people with good ideas and ingenuity to test those ideas, take the risks, make the investments, create the jobs that let the marketplace decide whether or not that is a good idea, or maybe somebody has a better idea, maybe it is less expensive, more efficient, less expensive, better quality, whatever it may be.;N
And I like very much how you conclude this thought by saying you believe the Technology Administration can continue to make vital contributions to the Nation's technology base and our national policies that support private sector technology development, commercialization and competitiveness, and we always need to be looking at what is going to help the competitiveness of our country and our people and our society.;N
Now, we have an issue coming up very shortly that is expiring, which has to do with taxes and tax policy and regulatory policy have an impact on our economy, and particularly in technology.;N
One of the best advances in my view has been the Internet, which is a tremendous way of disseminating new ideas.;N
Now, there is going to be, if the House and Senate do not act, this tax that--the moratorium on Internet access taxes.;N
Now, what impact do you think will that have--if that moratorium expired and was allowed to lapse, what impact do you think that would have on our economy?;N
Well, Senator Boxer, who is a Member of this Committee, Senator Boxer and I do not always agree on every issue.;N
While I prefer a permanent ban on access taxes, or discriminatory taxes, one has to be realistic here, and so we have joined up together to try to get that 5-year moratorium on it, and we will need all of your help to get that through on the Senate side, because clearly, adding tax burdens hardly is going to be helpful to the technology sector, which is undoubtedly--it was in bad shape before September 11, and there is nothing that has happened since September 11 to indicate any up-tick in that regard.;N
As far as--and this is to you, Dr. Marburger, and you can answer this as well, as well as Mr. Bond.;N
They damaged the short-term productivity of certain key sectors of our economy, and there is clearly a need to restore the economy and some of that is better security, improved security.;N
There have been changes in some of the dynamics, or the paradigms, even for airline pilots as to what do you do if someone is trying to commandeer your aircraft, but there is a need to improve our economy.;N
Now, what technologies, in either of you all's view--what technologies, whether they are existing or emerging technologies--do you see as potentially playing a key role in this recovery process, whether it is in security or the commercial economy generally?;N
Again, this could be governmental services, it could be the private sector, and also State, local, and Federal Governments, not just the Federal Government.;N
What technologies do you see as emerging in helping us restore our economy as well as enhance our security?;N
I would add to what our Chairman, Senator Wyden mentioned when he was meeting with certain folks back home, in his home in Oregon, the coordination of the data networks, the bioinformatics, talking with Secretary Thompson last week, one of the keys is actually all of those data networks, and we are still analyzing the anthrax attacks, or the anthrax incidents in Florida.;N
Originally it is going to come from the local health departments, the local emergency rooms, and it is absolutely critical in making sure--and I hate to use the word critical unless it really is critical, but in that the sooner one can determine if somebody has that malady, whether it is anthrax, smallpox, whatever it might be, that there is a better chance they have to live.;N
And the conglomeration, or the coordination of that information, say there are a few people who have certain symptoms in one locality, say the hospital in one locality finds two people with those symptoms, then over the mountain in another valley, they have six or eight and so forth, none of these hospitals necessarily are talking with one another.;N
But if that information gets to the State, gets to the CDC, at least you see a pattern, that there may be some likelihood of something going on, as opposed to an isolated incident, and that is where I think technology--and I do want to work with Senator Wyden on this to make sure that the bioinformatics are there so that we do have the prompt responses.;N
We are also going to have a hearing on Thursday here again on emergency coordination, and the Chairman mentioned GPS for firefighters.;N
We are going to have a hearing for fire services and firefighters, and much of it, while just listening to an officer who was trapped in the rubble up in New York City with the World Trade Centers, and I think his name was Fuentas, and they are trying to talk to him on whatever, whether it is a walkie-talkie, or whether it was a cell phone, regardless, they were having a hard time, in all of the dust and the darkness, and he could not say where he was.;N
If he had that GPS on him, then they could know where he is, and he could be in the midst of dust and smoke and fire and so forth, that someone has just passed out, and they are not going to be able to talk to one another, or that walkie-talkie or two-way radio or cell phone could be broken, but with that GPS they could find out, and fortunately they were able to find him, but nevertheless we need to learn from this disaster, or this terrorist attack, so that we can respond, and I think people responded remarkably well under the circumstances, but nevertheless, people want to respond even better in the future.;N
So you all will be very important, and your agencies, to give us guidance, good ideas, whether it is for our first responders, the medics, the emergency squads, the firefighters, law enforcement or others, and again, these are going to be pressing issues as well, and I am glad to hear the Chairman say we are going to look at where technology can improve aviation safety.;D
I have seen some of the research that was done at Langley Research Center, and what can be done as far as flight patterns, and virtual domes that can be put over certain buildings where a plane simply cannot fly into them.;N
Now, I am just going to finish with a broad question for you, because I do have a meeting in 2 minutes, or Mr. Bond, and I just think it is important for all of us to know where do you see your key role going to be?;N
What is going to be your top one or two priorities as Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, to ensure that our Nation's technology sector is healthy?;N
My view that there is no more important economic sector in our economy than the technology sector.;N
Yes, it is important for good jobs, good-paying jobs, it is important in manufacturing, so we have the most up-to-date, cleanest, most efficient, best quality methods of production, it is important for our health care, the life sciences, the medical sciences, it is important for communications, finance, education, it is vitally linked to technology and, indeed, our national defense is key to having us have a technological advantage, and we must as a Nation have that competitive attitude that we always have to be at the cutting edge, in the lead, because it is vital for our security, it is vital for our prosperity and for our quality of life.;N
So with those comments, where will be, in your view, your top two areas of concern to make sure our technology sector is leading, and continues to lead in the future?;N
I have found, not having been in Government for a few years until getting elected last year, that there is a digital divide between the private sector and the Federal Government, in the utilization and adaptation of new technologies.;N
Would you foresee yourself also having a role of making sure that the Federal Government and its agencies will adopt the latest technologies, whether for their own internal communications--you see it in the State Department.;N
I am on Foreign Relations, on that Committee, and it is amazing to me to read these reports that they could not even e-;N
mail within the same embassy, much less some outpost into Washington to the State Department, and I am glad Secretary Powell is there.;N
He was on the AOL board, and recognizes there are better ways to communicate, and that is not just for communications of our policy, but for the security, to know instantly what is going on and what is our policy, and what is to be said.;D
So I would hope that you also use it as a way for just internally--it would almost be like a CIO, so to speak, chief information officer, to make sure that you use these policies wherever possible and practical to save the taxpayer's money and provide better service to the public, contract out some of these services, because you could spend money, you can waste money more quickly on technology than about anything else, and it is important to get the most up to date, and if you can outsource some of that, sometimes that would be the best way for the taxpayers and the services, so would you make a commitment to also, in the midst of that deploying technologies, try to educate all Federal Government agencies.;N
I have been made chairman of the High Tech Task Force for the Republicans in the Senate, and that is exactly the term we said.;N
Whenever you get your e-mail address after the confirmation, we will certainly want to get it there so you can get all those good ideas.;D
I thank you for your insight and your testimony, and I know I speak for everyone on this Committee, we look forward to working with you to improve the lives of all Americans and also the world, so thank you so much.;N
Before my colleague leaves, let me just say how much I appreciate the comments you have made.;N
These clearly are areas where if you do not have a bipartisan front in terms of science and technology policy, it is not going to get done, so I am really pleased you are taking such an active role.;N
We are going to have a field hearing at Langley to look at those aviation technology issues you are talking about, and I very much look forward to working with you, and I have got some more questions for our two nominees, but I know you have got to run, and I just appreciate you spending all this time.;N
Dr. Marburger, I want to talk now about your role in the White House, and what your role is going to be specifically as a Science Advisor.;N
It is our understanding that previous Science Advisors were designated as Assistant to the President with the privileges and duties that applies, including sitting in on Cabinet meetings, and having direct access to the President of the United States.;N
On the other hand, there have been a number of press reports indicating that you are going to be designated something called a Special Assistant.;N
Now, I do not know if any of this is accurate, and I think it would be helpful for you to set out, on the basis of the conversations you have had with the President of the United States, how you see your role as Science Advisor for our country.;N
Well, that is encouraging, and you are absolutely right, titles, we can all have titles, but direct access to the President is important, and I gather you have now been given the assurance that you will have direct access to the President on issues that are important as it relates to science.;N
I mean, obviously there were a lot of big science issues that generated a great deal of public discussion long before September 11.;N
I will tell you I think it is almost unprecedented for a scientific issue in the dead of summer to generate the attention that the stem cell research debate generated.;N
I think it is literally unprecedented in sort of the dog days of August, when most Americans are at the beach, that we are having debates at virtually every kitchen table in the country with respect to stem cell research and the implications for health and science and entrepreneurship and the like.;N
Were you consulted on the stem cell issue, and if so, without violating any confidences, what was your general counsel?;N
Well, that is something that I was trying to be sensitive to as well, and I want to ask you your views on a handful of other important scientific issues, again not to try to get you to commit to sort of one bill or one program or another, but to try to assess a little bit how you are approaching some of these issues, and that is why I asked the previous question in a general sort of way, and understand the sensitivity of the matters, and the fact that you are going to be in the room, and be in a position to make sure that you can get your views on science issues, which we respect very much, heard, is one that I am interested in.;N
Frankly, if we did not have respect for your background and your expertise, we would not make such a push and such a point of stressing it.;D
I have been concerned at the number of private companies and the number of private donors that were in effect already committed to funding stem cell research who are walking away, and are walking away as a result of the administration's policy in this area.;N
There were several, for example, op ed pieces in the Wall Street Journal after the President's decision, with large donors saying we do not think we are going to be in a position in this climate to ensure that the important research that needs to go forward is going to be possible.;N
Set aside the question of whether there is X number of stem cell lines available or not, and tell me whether you are troubled by the fact that a number of private companies have abandoned their plans in this country and are moving overseas to pursue stem cell research as a result of the administration's decision.;N
Well, I hope that you will, as your answer suggests, monitor carefully what goes on in the private sector, because I know I was troubled by the fact that those private companies that do not have an ideological orientation to these kinds of things were saying that we are going to pack up, we are going to go overseas, and if you are saying, and your answer is a good one, that you are going to monitor this, and that you want to have a strategy to get some of these people back, and to do it in line with ethical standards for research, then I appreciate that answer, and it is a good one.;N
Let me talk to you about global climate change for a minute, and try to see if I can understand what the administration's position is from a scientific standpoint.;N
As I understand it, we are essentially now standing out there by ourselves with 180 countries or thereabouts not being in accord with our view, and as I understand the administration's position, the theory is that the administration will fund various kinds of experimental efforts and research kind of efforts, and the theory is, is that when these efforts go forward they are going to produce data and information which somehow is going to get these other 180 countries to stop what they think makes sense and go at it our way.;N
How would you characterize where we are on the global climate change issue from a scientific standpoint, and where we stand on this issue, and how, if at all, you intend to be involved in it?;N
When are we likely to see those programs, the ones that seem to be being offered as an alternative?;N
Because I will tell you, I am troubled by the fact that we are out there by ourselves, with 180 countries joining hands, and the United States essentially outside that, but I am even more troubled that I do not understand essentially how we are going to fund some of these important scientific projects and use it to build a consensus to be part of an effort that has us joining the rest of the world.;N
Senator Brownback, for example, he and I joined forces on carbon sequestration with respect to agriculture and timber.;N
We think what we are doing in terms of carbon sequestration might, in a way that would be supported by agriculture and environmental people, and your scientists and the like, help us to deal with perhaps 25 percent of the global warming problem.;N
That is not 100 percent, but to deal with 25 percent of the problem in a bipartisan kind of way ain't bad by Washington, DC standards, and I would very much like to have you, as these additional scientific initiatives go forward where you look at various approaches, and presumably find science that you consider acceptable and try to persuade other countries to do it, to take an active role on it, and to work with us to speed it up, because this message that we are going to stand out there by ourselves, while 180 other people can make an agreement, I think is very unfortunate.;N
If we go any further with this, I am only likely to get you in trouble, because if there is consensus on science, then what seems plausible to me is what is holding it up is politics, and that, of course is outside your bailiwick.;N
Let me ask you a question to follow up on Senator Allen's good point about Internet taxes.;N
We have had discussions among the Members of this Committee, very constructive discussions among Members of this Committee, Senator Dorgan, Senator Hollings, Senator McCain and others, and what can the administration do to help us break the gridlock and get this resolved?;N
My sense is, if the President says, ``Ron Wyden and John McCain put in a 2-year bill, and given this difficult economic situation I want to see that bill passed'', I think that is the one that goes through the U.S. Senate.;N
If the President wants something else, I think it would be very helpful to hear from the Administration now.;N
What can you tell me in terms of how the Administration can help break the gridlock up here on this?;N
As you know, it is my view that there is not a single jurisdiction in this country, not a single local governmental body that can show that they have been hurt by their inability to discriminate against the Internet, and that is all the current law says.;N
The current law always says you cannot tax the Internet as if you were creating some kind of Cayman Islands with the Internet.;N
You just have to treat the offline world like you treat the online world, and I would hope that the administration would weigh in aggressively here for one of the bills that is going to extend the moratorium and let us get on with it, because the last thing the economy needs now is to set up a crazy quilt of local and State taxes, which is what could come about if, for example, the Congress adjourns and the moratorium is not extended, and I think you know that, Phil, and just convey the urgency of it.;N
Let us talk a bit about the portal idea that you see for small business, and like Senator Allen, I am very supportive of this, and I think it can make a real difference, particularly for small businesses, which I know you have been very interested in.;N
How do you see this creating opportunities for small businesses in particular through the portal?;N
How do you envisage your position and your watch interacting with the communications side of the technology debate?;N
For example, I am very interested, and a lot of Members of this Committee are very interested in the question of spectrum policy.;N
I would like to see marketplace forces introduced into the allocation of spectrum in our country.;N
A number of our colleagues would as well, and I am not completely clear how Commerce is going to divide up how spectrum policy is made.;N
I assume Ms. Victor is going to be involved in this, and you and Mr. Mellman and others, but perhaps you could tell us a little bit about how your office is going to work on the communications side of technology policy.;N
Well, this, and I think the Secretary knows that I have a great interest in this, as do a number of Members of the Committee.;N
This is a perfect area to try to build some new incentives to create efficiencies, and they do not exist now.;N
Basically, if you got something 2 decades ago just hang onto it, you can basically hold everybody hostage, and we are going to be anxious to work with you on it.;N
In my office, you assured me that you would transmit to the administration and to Mr. Ridge our interest in working to try to coordinate the private sector responses to what happened on September 11 with technology.;N
I just want to give you a chance to say publicly what you said in my office on that point.;N
So to have the administration saying sign me up is great, and we are just finalizing plans on that, and Mr. Bond, you have been great, and very accessible, and I appreciate it.;N
Senator Schumer wanted to convey to Dr. Marburger his strong support for you, and a letter from Senator Chuck Schumer needs to go into the record at this point as well.;N
I want to ask you a couple of things about the nanotechnology initiative, which strikes me as very promising, and they are going to deal with both the coordination question and the substance.;N
We have got six agencies already that seem to be part of the nanotechnology initiative, and we are going to need you and your colleagues to some extent to bring people together, or the GAO will be writing reports on nanotechnology 2 years from now and they will say, so-and-so did it, and so-and-so did exactly the same thing, and why weren't those characters on the Science and Technology Subcommittee watching it.;N
I have felt for a long time that there is nothing partisan about the matters that we are talking about and, in fact, if you cannot get bipartisan agreement in key areas like we are talking about today, like combatting terrorism, that research is not going to get done in our country, and we are going to suffer as a result.;N
Fortunately, there has been a bit more bipartisanship since September 11, and with two good people like yourselves taking on these key positions, I think you can help us advance that bipartisanship in an important area, and I will tell you, because I have had a chance to both listen to you and to meet with you, that I have very high expectations for you two.;N
I have expectations of you two that I would not normally have for people that come before this Committee, or any Committee in the U.S. Senate, and I think you are going to meet them, and so I thank you very much.;N
If there is anything the two of you would like to add further, we will welcome it, or otherwise we will adjourn.;N
This is our first day back, and I would have rather held this at 9:30 this morning, but we could not.;N
This is an extremely important nomination, and I hope soon to be a confirmation out of this Committee prior to September 11, and hopefully in the Senate.;N
I know that your husband, Dr. Bill Dooley, is here and that Mona, your daughter, is here as well.;N
"We are very happy to welcome you along with Michael Jackson, our Deputy Secretary; and also you, Conrad Burns, who I have not seen in a month, but we have made it through.";N
The FAA Administrator is one of the four or five most difficult positions, least understood positions, in the entire Federal Government, and enormously important.;N
I think it is not useful in most of our functions, but sometimes in terms of oversight it is necessary.;N
We get a little oversight from our constituents, you get a little oversight from Congress, and the democracy has held together pretty well for over 220 years.;N
I do not think she was displeased to leave, which was interesting, because it is part of the pressure that you are constantly under.;N
Today, after 5 years of her tenure, there are major airport expansion projects around the country.;N
In my opinion, the FAA has a better-established relationship with air traffic controllers and other employees than at any time in the 18 years that I have been on this Committee and in the Senate.;N
I know it, and I know you, so I feel that I can say that without fear of contradiction from my conscience.;N
So you do your good job at NTSB, and you move on to something which is even more complicated and in the public eye.;N
There can be no doubt that these challenges are daunting and a few of them will include safety--the FAA's primary mission.;N
But since September 11th members of this Committee, with all of us here in Congress, have been consumed by security-related issues.;N
But on the other hand, September 11th made clear to everybody how much work needs to be done in this area.;N
Our work on transportation security does not make transportation safety any less important.;N
Indeed, given the difficulties that the aviation sector has experienced in the wake of September 11, it is even more critical that we continue to improve the industry's safety record, and to win back the confidence, in any way that we can of the public.;N
It is a little bit of a mystery in some ways, part of the American psyche, part of the times, but nevertheless it is a problem and airlines are reacting to it in ways which are not serving some of us in small States in ways that we particularly like.;N
Last month Secretary Mineta and Administrator Garvey indicated the FAA may have to furlough air traffic service employees if additional moneys were not appropriated.;N
Since that time, Congress has appropriated some additional funding, but not the amount requested by the Federal Aviation Administration.;N
I am hoping that your testimony will address both your thoughts on the immediate budget situation and on ways we can deal with the issue over the longer term.;N
We finally passed a decent authorization bill, but we basically have been ignoring aviation infrastructure for all of these years.;N
Some of us have started to look back wistfully to last summer, when congestion was the most pressing issue facing the aviation industry.;N
The O'Hare modernization bill, which is something I, as Subcommittee Chairman, feel tremendously strong about--there has been some controversy, but not a great deal, and I think it has to happen.;N
It sort of determines what happens in all kinds of other places, like North Dakota and West Virginia, and I do not know about Arizona, but I suspect Montana, and probably Arizona.;N
"Senator Hutchison, who is my ranking member, and really we are co-chairs, she is absolutely terrific; we authored a bill that would have streamlined the whole process of getting runways under way.";N
You face a number of challenges in this area, including how to replace retiring air traffic controllers, contract negotiations with the air traffic controllers union, and controversies surrounding the deployment of new equipment.;N
Some stunning figures: a June 2002 GAO study found that approximately 5,000 controllers may retire in the next 5 years, which--``may'' usually means ``will''--is twice the rate of the last 5 years.;N
By 2010, GAO estimates that a total of 7,000 will retire, almost 50 percent of the 15,000 air traffic controllers who now operate.;N
Most of the FAA's aviation security functions have been transferred to the new Transportation Security Administration.;N
The FAA Administrator will nonetheless have a large role, particularly in those areas where security and safety issues intersect, and there are plenty of those.;N
Your management of the air traffic control system, for example, has both safety and security implications.;N
The same goes for pilot licensing, aircraft design specifications, reinforced cockpit doors.;N
I have a number of questions that I want to ask, as I am sure others do, and they have statements, and I apologize mine is so long.;N
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing on the nomination of Ms. Blakey to serve as the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.;N
As we all know, Jane Garvey, who served with distinction as Administrator of the FAA for the past 5 years, left at the end of her term on August 4th.;D
It is important that we ensure that the FAA has strong leadership to continue the legacy established by Administrator Garvey.;D
I initially had some doubts about the depth and breadth of Ms. Garvey's aviation experience prior to her being nominated as the FAA Administrator.;D
However, I believe Ms. Blakey has exhibited strong leadership qualities in her most recent position as Chairman of the NTSB, in addition to many other roles held within the Federal Government over the years.;D
The confirmation of a new Administrator will mark the second appointment after Congress enacted the 5-year term provision.;N
The 5-year term is key to the FAA's ability to maintain its independence and its status as the premier aviation safety agency in the world.;N
The extended term of the administrators and the agency's independence make it essential that its leader be unswayed by party loyalties and unaffected by political winds.;N
As you just stated, Mr. Chairman, the new administrator will face numerous challenges in the coming months and years.;N
Since September 11th, much attention has been focused on the new Transportation Security Administration.;N
The FAA has continued to operate well, but has not faced the Congressional scrutiny over the past year that it normally attracts.;N
That is going to change in light of so many issues that will soon confront our new air transportation system.;N
In addition to security, we will need to focus on building new runways and infrastructure and expand existing capacity.;N
Further, the collective bargaining agreement between the air traffic controllers and the agency is set to expire.;N
I cannot remain for the entire hearing either, but I did want to come today to say I support this nomination.;N
But again, this is a good choice and I am going to be supporting Ms. Blakey's nomination and do so with enthusiasm.;N
There is a chief operating officer position, a COO, that we authorized in Congress in 1999.;N
I expect, Ms. Blakey, as you assume this job--and I believe the Congress certainly will move to support your nomination--as you assume this job, I am guessing that you will very much want these other positions to be filled.;N
I hope the administration will send us names of the quality that they have sent for the Administrator's job.;D
But we do--I think, given the challenges that we face, we need to have the deputy, we need to have the COO that was authorized by Congress.;N
I would just like to mention that we face a lot of challenges in air travel, especially commercial air travel, these days.;N
I mean, you open up a paper and you see the potential bankruptcy of some of the largest carriers, a troubled economy and what that spells for the aviation industry.;N
And you are going to try to run a system that is the largest air traffic control system in the world, be responsible for aviation safety and oversee funds for the construction of the infrastructure.;D
So we want to work with you and see that you do that job well and help you do that job well.;N
It seems to me that there is a reluctance sometimes on the part of Federal agencies to use resources that the Federal Government has already invested in and paid for.;N
We have at the University of North Dakota what is often referred to as the Harvard of the Sky, the Center for Aerospace Science, in fact one of the preeminent centers in the country.;N
They, among other things, train air traffic controllers, and they have done contracts with the FAA.;N
I have been there and I have watched on both sides of the same board Russian air traffic controllers being trained, talking to Chinese air traffic controllers in the same room, with an air traffic control board separating them.;N
That is done at an educational institution with Federal investment having been made over the last dozen years or so.;N
I really want the FAA to take a look at those capabilities that exist around the country, not just at this institution, but at others as well, to find out how you can use that investment that has already been made to help you train more and more air traffic controllers as you need them.;N
You will hear a great deal about that from Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, and myself as we go along.;N
I wish you well and I will certainly vote for your confirmation with enthusiasm and look forward to working with you.;N
I happen to believe that we made a couple of mistakes in our airport security bill and now we are sort of paying for that and seeing what can actually happen when you create something and it is never uncreated, in fact it becomes a giant that we cannot handle.;N
Now they are telling us there that they are going to have to have 76 screeners in Bozeman, Montana, that loads around 225,000 people a year.;N
If they just run around over each other, maybe they will have a hard time getting through each other to help folks out with their bags.;N
But we have created this and now we are seeing what can happen when we, maybe with good intentions, but we also have some unintentional things happening that do not make us any safer and there is no way they can make us any safer.;N
"We have a couple of areas up there that we have been trying to get their attention the last--ever since I have been here--14 years; and so far I guess we have not made a strong enough case.";N
But I hope that you will take our recommendations and take a look into it and see what we can do to fix it.;N
You understand, Ms. Blakey, that the best time to ask the questions is before confirmation.;N
I think you are going to be a great FAA Administrator and I have had the opportunity to get to know you a little bit.;N
I think you have a superb record of public service in a variety of transportation-related posts, most recently at the National Transportation Safety Board.;N
I think one of the biggest things the country is going to have to confront in upcoming years is how we change from a radar-based air traffic control system to a global positioning satellite system.;N
The FAA has had difficulty implementing new air traffic control systems in the past and so I think there will be significant managerial issues that you will confront.;N
But I am convinced, on the basis of a review of your record and having met you in person on a couple of occasions and having had the opportunity to talk to you, that you have the makings of a fine FAA Administrator.;N
I am glad that the Committee is moving expeditiously here, because we cannot have that post vacant for too long.;N
So my thanks to the Chairman for having this hearing our first day back from the August break.;N
Welcome, Ms. Blakey, and we will look forward to talking to you in the question and answer section.;N
It is, I think, the greatest new technology since radar and really is going to improve our aviation system greatly.;N
Alaska has seven times more pilots per capita than the national average, so if you want to learn something about flying come up our way.;N
You have probably the most important job for Alaska that I can think of within the Administration, other than the fellow that lives at 1600 Pennsylvania.;N
We are making great progress right now because of work that your agency has done along with various other agencies dealing with past fatalities in our aviation community.;N
Safety is on the front burner in Alaska and we need your help to make sure those programs go through, like the Medallion program--a totally volunteer, industry-conceived and industry-operated program.;N
You cannot tell Alaskan pilots what to do from Washington, but you can let them tell themselves what to do from Alaska, and it is working very well.;N
I certainly look forward, and I have read your remarks, Ms. Blakey, to your being the Administrator of the FAA.;D
The Administrator of the FAA has always been a very important position--enormously important--and vital to our economy, communities, the States, and jobs.;N
In our economy, obviously, how the aviation industry is moving does have an impact on jobs.;N
I am glad to see that you have noticed the need for air traffic control modernization and also, now more than ever since September 11th, the need for security.;N
I would say, Mr. Chairman, that Ms. Blakey is an outstanding choice to be Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.;D
You have impressive credentials and background, and I commend the President for this outstanding choice.;D
Now, I will certainly, and I think this Committee will, work with you for the modernization of the air traffic control system.;N
I am pleased that in your written responses to the Committee's questions, you mention air traffic control modernization as one of your top priorities in the first 2 years of your administration of FAA.;N
I encourage you to look at new technologies, how technology can help us in scheduling, in creating virtual domes around protected areas--whether they are nuclear power plants or buildings such as the Capitol or others.;N
Senator Dodd and I will be introducing or planning to introduce an aeronautics revitalization bill this month intended to reverse the trend of reduced funding for aeronautics research and development.;N
The bill will hopefully include provisions addressing air traffic control management and modernization issues.;N
Secretary Mineta at a hearing on aviation security here in May, when queried by me on the situation, said that the plan would be announced by the end of the month.;N
We then had another hearing in July, and I asked him again about the Department's plan to open Reagan National to general aviation.;N
We are now nearly a year from the tragic events, and Reagan National remains closed to general aviation.;N
It is my hope that we can work together to find the right security, the right procedures, so that we can have secure general aviation back at Reagan National Airport.;N
If they had their way, Reagan National would probably be closed to commercial aviation as well.;N
So we need to build good security, sound security, enhanced obviously for Reagan National, but get it back open for general aviation.;N
Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing in such a timely manner, and I look forward to working with you and hearing your responses to various questions.;N
Let me just say, first of all, Ms. Blakey, we welcome this opportunity to explore some issues with you.;N
I had some reservations about proceeding earlier on this and I want you to know that it has nothing to do with the question of your qualifications whatsoever.;N
You are eminently qualified and I think it is important to, obviously, get somebody in this job.;D
But I did think it was important to try to signal concern that a number of us have about existing employees within the FAA who are members of AFSCME who had a contract that has been in existence--let me just say, that was agreed upon between the FAA at the end of the Clinton Administration, and there is a disagreement between the parties now as to what procedure might have been followed after that.;N
But for an unknown reason it has been sent to OMB and it has sort of been held there, which was not part of the agreement at the end of the Clinton Administration.;N
So there are some 2,000 employees whose morale is low, whose capacities are not being utilized to the fullest as a consequence of this situation.;N
I do not think that anyone is well served by having a year and a half go by in which the contract sort of sits in limbo.;N
The message that is sent by that is I suppose discernible, if indeed that is the message that is meant to be sent.;N
If it is not the message that is meant to be sent, then there is no reason not to complete the mission, so to speak.;N
Second, Boston Logan Airport is one of the few places in the country that is going to meet the screening deadline on time.;N
We are proud of that, particularly because of the sad, tragic association of that airport with the events of last year.;N
But it is having great trouble getting compensation under the TSA for the expenditures and for the layout.;N
I think again, if there is going to be that kind of sort of slow response--I know that is not directly under you.;N
I think you as a prospective Administrator will have an enormous capacity to be able to have an impact on those kinds of decisions because you still will have a very serious role with respect to airport safety.;N
The final comment I just want to make very quickly is there are a whole slew of issues, obviously, which for a long time have been subject to enormous bureaucratic resistance.;N
But somehow the economy and the safety of our airways and the capacity of our airports to be maximized and of our ability to move goods and people, both of which are essential for the growth of our country, are restrained as a result, just because there is this inertia, this unwillingness to try and move and make decisions, whether it was getting screening equipment into airports or whether it is resolving some of the airway congestion.;N
Speaking to what Senator Allen just said, there seems to be a defiance of common sense in some of the security procedures and some of the ways in which we are approaching decisions about aircraft routes and flights and so forth.;N
There has to be a way that one can create a clearance system for general aviation with pilots, many of whom are ex-American military, who have security clearances, who have all the ability in the world through codes, transponders, and other things to signal whether there is a problem on the tarmac or whether there has been a hijack, whatever.;N
There are ways to create a system that does not have to shut down commercial enterprise the way we are today.;N
There are ways to facilitate the flow of people through our airports with the modern technology of personal identification that we have today, to be able to create less lines, less backup, and less sort of stupid--the story, I know it is a nice symbol to have Al Gore stopped with everybody else, with his arms out and so forth, being searched.;N
But if everybody does in fact know who that person is, while four other people may pass by who might better have been served with that kind of search, it does not make sense, and I do not think anybody here thinks it does make sense.;N
So there has to be, I hope, a way to try to streamline the capacity of our country to sort of facilitate people's flow through airports and to again de-congest the airways, which have been an ongoing problem for some period of time, more rapidly and more effectively.;N
I really hope that you will set about to rapidly examine and try to implement those methodologies.;N
I might just mention, Ms. Blakey, that in flying home from one of our many, many flights from West Virginia to this area last night, I went through a complete search and took my shoes off, and it was good.;N
My point is that it is not--the people who were doing it were sort of embarrassed about it.;N
But I, evidently, had something in my shoe or something that bothered them and they had to do that.;N
In fact, other passengers were watching it and I think it sort of democratized the process.;N
You know, everybody gets the same treatment, and if you are going to be security conscious you have got to be security conscious on an equal basis.;N
I do not mean to disagree specifically with the example of Senator Kerry, but I was glad I went through that process last night.;N
The Secretary indicated that he had to have $100 million and he was appropriated $42 million with another $33 million that could have come out of the Airport Trust Fund.;N
Now, being involved with aviation as I am, I think it is essential that Congress do what is necessary to keep our aviation system moving and having it fully staffed.;N
So I am wondering, how do you react to this question of shortfall, potential large or medium-sized shortfall in terms of funding, particularly as it affects inspectors and controllers?;N
You can talk for however long you want, and I apologize to your husband and to your daughter.;N
Let me just go back to, again going to the 5-minute rule, to the question that I originally asked.;N
We hear it really in so many fields now, in teaching, but for the purposes of this you have that many air traffic controllers retiring, 50 percent.;N
It takes a long time to train and then to develop the experience of one of these air traffic control people to be able to operate.;N
So my question to you obviously is, to the extent that you have had a chance to think about it--and I understand that you are still at NTSB--how do you look at that situation?;N
It has been interesting to me, Ms. Blakey, that in a number of agencies--intelligence agencies, law enforcement, social workers--that is not an agency, but a profession--teaching, Peace Corps, VISTA, all kinds of things that are associated with the public good as well as with public safety, there has been a remarkably sharp increase in the number of applications to do that work.;N
That does not necessarily mean--of course, that was also true with screeners--that everybody who applies is going to be able to get there or ought to get there.;N
Has there been any similar expression of interest, more applications, that you are aware of that have made themselves available for that field?;N
I hope that--my time is about to run out--FAA will not be afraid to market that position, because it combines a lot of qualities that people want, mathematics, so to speak, computers, console, dark room intensity, fast decisionmaking, teamwork, danger, enormous responsibility, and ought to be in and of itself very, very attractive.;N
Even though it is exhausting for people who have been through it, it should have great appeal.;N
It would seem to me that that is one of the things we could explore, how to make that appear to be and in fact draw people out as a very attractive kind of work.;N
That is why I am trying to ask you about some specific issues, to get a sense of how you are going to approach them.;N
Here the Transportation Security Administration again has a lead responsibility, but the Federal Aviation Administration has a key role to play with the airports, and the airports are going to be out there installing all those scanners.;N
My sense is, if this problem is not resolved in the next few months there is going to be absolute chaos, because we are going to have a busy travel season.;N
It basically says, I am not going to read the whole thing, very little substantive has been done in the last 6, 7 months.;N
But I can tell you, I do not think it has been anywhere near what it needs to be, and unless you can sort out with the Transportation Security Administration some of these key issues--and I am talking about in the next 60 days--I think there is just going to be chaos this holiday season.;N
Let me turn now to the question of the agency's bureaucracy, and particularly these costly and time-consuming certification procedures that seem to be holding up getting new and safer aircraft and equipment out there.;N
Now, what we hear from the general aviation community is that they are particularly concerned that these certification procedures are keeping technological improvements, improvements that would absolutely translate into areas of increased safety, that they are the ones that are not being made a high priority.;N
Can you give us some assurance that, as it relates to certification processes for technological improvements on safety, that you will make that a top priority?;N
Senator Burns, before I call on you I just wondered if Senator Snowe has any comments she wants to make.;N
We have been trying to take care of that dark spot around Bozeman and Butte and Helena a long time.;N
I am going to ask you a couple questions, and I do not know where it goes or where it ends up.;N
But somebody is going to run into one another up there one of these days and they are going to say: Golly, we should have done that 14 years ago.;N
I am aware there has been reports that unairworthy or not properly tested or certified parts are being placed into aircraft and engines during their maintenance, repair, and overhaul cycles, often through so-called PMAs--that is, parts manufacturer's approvals.;N
I also understand that the FAA has been working on a complete rewrite of its certification procedures for products and parts, Part 21, for the past decade, but it is bogged down and no final rule has been issued.;N
It is the same thing that this Senator that was sitting right here said about when are they going to write the rules for the Grand Canyon.;N
I am not looking to add any new regulatory burdens on aircraft owners or operators, but it seems to me that the FAA needs to be doing more to ensure that when the work is done to repair and replace parts on aircraft or their engines, it does not degrade the original safety margins of the equipment.;N
We would like for those rules to be written and I would like for them to be reported back to this Committee, and especially to me.;N
I am to the end of my rope as far as trying to do some safety things with radar in that little triangle area of Butte, Helena, and Bozeman, and I am not getting anywhere there and he is not getting anywhere on the rules and regulations.;N
There is no excuse for not writing the rules and putting them into effect, at least put them out there where they are open for criticism.;N
As far as screening is concerned, I still think the screening thing--we are discriminated against, those of us who wear boots.;N
You cannot have any holes in them now and expect your wife to speak to you after you go through the screen, No. 1.;N
So I would like to have your commitment today that that will be high on your priority list once you are confirmed, and I am going to vote for your confirmation, but I want to see something happen down there, Ms. Blakey, I really do, because we have waited long enough.;N
Well, we are talking about something--and I just want your commitment to that, and explain to those folks who wrote them rules that maybe they should seek employment somewhere else.;N
I wanted to ask a question about something that happened under Jane Garvey's years at the FAA.;N
I think she in general did a very good job, but there was one issue that I disagreed with her on.;D
She urged Congress to pass a law that lifted delay controls at various airports where there was more demand than the airport had capacity for.;N
By 1969 it was at full capacity, and since 1969 demand has always exceeded capacity at O'Hare.;N
But in 1969 the FAA put in regulations, delay control regulations to prevent airlines from scheduling more flights at O'Hare than the airport had capacity to handle.;N
But as soon as Ms. Garvey urged Congress to lift those delay controls, we passed a statute that overrode and wiped out regulations that the FAA put into effect in 1969, delays shot through the roof at O'Hare and the traveling public has been brought to its knees at O'Hare because the airlines that operate there are allowed to schedule as many flights as they would like, regardless of the airport's capacity.;N
So I guess--I know that since then the FAA has changed its position with respect to LaGuardia and they have reimposed delay controls at LaGuardia.;N
We have to endure a system in which the airport has capacity in good weather for maybe 220 flights an hour.;N
The old delay controls I think used to make the airlines schedule an average of about 180 flights an hour.;N
Now they can schedule as many as they want, which often means that travelers at O'Hare have no chance of getting off the ground at their scheduled departure time.;N
Our newspapers in Chicago, the Sun-Times and the Tribune, have done exposes showing that at some moments of the day--I think 8:45 is a very popular time to fly--the airlines will schedule 25 or more flights to take off at 8:45 in the morning, even though the airport only has capacity for three flights to take off at that time.;N
"Would you be adverse to looking at that issue and seeing if there is not a better way that we could manage delays by somehow preventing the airlines--I know they have a problem; they cannot sit down and work out their schedules together because that would raise antitrust issues.";N
Do you have any thoughts on this issue, or is it something you just would approach with an open mind?;N
With respect to air traffic control, as we need more and more capacity in this country there will be a lot of people urging you to bring flights closer together, to allow procedures at airports such as LAHSO, Land And Hold Short, procedures that potentially cut the margin of safety.;N
When you have to make those kind of decisions, how do you go about balancing safety on the one hand and efficiency on the other hand?;N
I was vacationing in Colorado over the recess and had the opportunity to go visit NORAD in Colorado Springs, and in talking to the Air Force people there they led me to believe that every military plane already has global positioning satellite navigation and that they use it for their own purposes and that they are way ahead of commercial aviation in this country.;N
The chairman of United when I first got sworn into office 4 years ago was telling me about that, and it still has not happened.;N
Is there anything that you can do to speed the realization of global positioning satellite technology on commercial aircraft in this country and having it take over our traffic management from the radar-based system that we now have?;N
I hope we have a speedy confirmation here in the Senate and I look forward to working with you in the months and years to come.;N
I am gratified to hear that even the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee gets checked when he goes through his hometown airport for schedule purposes in West Virginia.;N
I think that your appointment sends a very important signal to this country due to your considerable background with the National Transportation Safety Board and Government service.;N
I am impressed with your knowledge on the issues of safety, of making safety the first and foremost priority, and having the depth and breadth of understanding of those issues and the implications for the traveling public.;D
I think there is no question, in the aftermath of September 11th, that safety is clearly a major, major priority for this Congress and for this country.;N
I know in the past, as others have mentioned here in the Committee, that with respect to the National Transportation Safety Board many of the policies and recommendations that have been made have not been implemented by the FAA.;N
I hope that you will take a look at some of those issues in this position, because I do think it is critical for the future to really look at some of the safety recommendations to ensure that we have the highest standards possible in this country for the traveling public.;N
So I welcome you, because I do think that with your skills and leadership it clearly can continue to put FAA at the forefront on those issues that are so important to this country.;D
One of the areas that has been a problem for somebody that represents the State of Maine, and I know the Chairman in West Virginia, is that we are rural States, and the implications of the type of policies that do come from the FAA do have disparate implications for a small rural State versus more urban States and more urban communities.;N
For example, recently the FAA issued a policy that allowed for the construction of the sixth runway at Logan Airport, but it was conditional on developing a peak pricing plan, so that they would increase the fees for those slots and times that obviously were at peak times during the course of the day.;N
In the past when that policy has been tried, it clearly has had ramifications for small States that rely on small regional carriers.;N
Today they have one service between Boston and Presque Isle and that is through the Essential Air Service Program.;N
So I am asking you to really consider the implications of policies that affect small and medium-sized communities versus urban areas, because clearly when the decision is made, for example, by Logan Airport and its authority, they are going to make a decision that is obviously going to affect those that carry the least number of passengers.;N
Obviously, coming from a rural area, we are not going to have the big jets going into Logan.;N
Obviously, we are very concerned in Maine because it will ultimately affect small regional carriers, the commuter aircraft that rely on going through Logan so that people can make their connections to other parts of the country or abroad.;N
I just think it is important for the FAA when they are crafting that type of policy to make sure that there is an understanding about the effects it has on small, rural areas that rely on commuter air service for any kind of air transportation.;N
Clearly what would have happened in the past--that is why it evoked such a major reaction--was that the first casualty would be commuter aircraft, the smaller aircraft, because they carry fewer passengers.;N
But if we were to use that logic, obviously, and we extrapolate from that, obviously either our service is going to be more expensive if we have it at all, and that certainly would be the implication of that type of policy in the final analysis, because obviously the peak traffic hours are important to those of us here in Maine as well.;N
So I think that we have to design a package that does keep in mind the effects of a policy when it comes to small States that rely on commuter aircraft, because otherwise we would never win under that scenario and we would ultimately face the impact of that type of policy.;N
Obviously, we are very concerned about this peak pricing policy, and I know that the goal is to reduce delays at Logan and that is an important objective because they do have major problems with delays.;N
But on the other hand, I want to make sure that we are not excluded from this process to the extent that we feel the true impact of that policy.;N
On another issue, back in December 2000 the FAA issued an order regarding distribution of takeoff and landing slots at LaGuardia and a lottery system was held to allocate the limited number of slots available to air carriers.;N
One carrier, for example, from our State, again a small carrier, lost most of their slots under this lottery system, in fact as a result dropped the service from Portland, Maine, to LaGuardia.;N
But again, these type of actions ultimately reverberate on the smaller communities in the final analysis, and the underserved communities continue to be further underserved because of these policies.;N
So I would hope that again when you are looking at implementing these different approaches that you would look at this, at the impact it would have on smaller communities, because the lottery system did have that effect and so ultimately the carrier did cancel its service because they lost most of their slots.;N
What in your view could be done to relieve congestion, at least in terms of what Congress could do to relieve congestion at various airports?;N
Have you given that any thought at this point in order to ensure that we can take various approaches, what Congress could do, in addition to airport construction?;N
Well, I think it would be important at some point when you assume this position to get your input and providing it to this Committee and to the Congress about what you view the priorities are in terms of what we could do now on non-air traffic control initiatives, certainly where the Congress is involved, to ensure that we can do everything we can put in place to avoid delays in the future.;N
We have seen a sharp decrease in delays compared to where we were in 1999 and 2000, obviously, with the effects of September 11th and the economic slowdown.;N
There has been a projection that there will be a billion passengers a year passing through airports by the year 2010, and the question is will we have the type of technology and infrastructure in place and what should Congress be doing if we are not doing it already.;N
So your assessment I think on that would be very important as you move ahead in your responsibilities in making sure that we are fully informed.;N
One of them is actually for your speeding up of the process of confirmation, although the question is not one that you will welcome.;N
There are some holds on your nomination, as you know, and we do not want that and it is dangerous for the American people and it is dangerous for everybody who has anything to do with the airline industry for you not to be in that position.;N
Now, the contract was negotiated, it was agreed to, it was signed off by AFSCME, it was signed off by the Federal Aviation Administration, it was ratified by the union members, and then it was stopped cold in the Office of Management and Budget.;N
It involves 2,000 people and it is not going to go away unless something is done and it potentially could affect your confirmation.;N
I am not one of the holders, but you can say that is playing hardball, or you can say this is getting at a basic issue because we are talking about the morale and how people are treated and this and that and the other thing--contract agreed to, you-them, or your predecessor-them, stopped at OMB, where so many things in all administrations die, because they have special responsibilities and they are not always the warmest of hearts that reside over there.;N
before I came to this Committee hearing, I said to another Senator in our caucus that we were going to have this hearing.;N
The Senator made a very interesting comment which resonated with me, because I have been watching government for quite a long time.;N
I was a Governor for 8 years and did not have quite as many people working for me as you will at 50,000.;N
It always interested me and it has interested me a lot more since I have gotten here, in a small State a Governor, for example, to wit you, can issue an order or can do a directive or pursue something and there is always a fairly close relationship between the State Government and the people who work for it and a Governor.;N
There were those on this Committee that opposed the idea of aviation security going to homeland security.;N
I think it is a good idea, because I think you have so much to do, you will be involved with it anyway.;N
But the whole concept of what you call the culture of bureaucracy, the culture of non-change, the culture of, oh, Administrator Blakey is going to come and then she is going to go.;N
Yes, she will be here for 5 years, that is unusual, but then she will go, then there will be somebody else.;N
This is like Senators who have been here for a long time say: Oh, I have been through five presidents, I have been through seven presidents, whatever it is.;N
There develops this kind of a culture of ``we are who we are and people may tell us what to do, but we do not listen because we do what we do.;N
"They say the world has changed, but our equipment has not changed, our ethos has not changed, our self-esteem has not changed; we show up to work, we do the same thing.''";N
"I am on the Intelligence Committee; I watch in there the most intimate and immediate matters of national security, the reluctance of people in various organizations that work on that to change the way they do business, to change their patterns of behavior, basically culture.";N
That is a big deal, people do not show up, and when the Administrator shows up that really means something.;N
On the other hand, FAA is changing so fast, needs to change so fast, its various functions need to be modernized so quickly.;N
We, for the first time, we were very lax in Congress, finally passed a reauthorization bill.;N
But one of the things I think nobody can doubt is that O'Hare may not be a problem for delays in O'Hare itself, but it sure is a problem in West Virginia and every other place that any plane out of O'Hare flies to or from.;N
Now, that does not mean that you can take air traffic control and ask them to do something differently until you have the technology to allow them to either separate distances, altitude in the air, or whatever distances between planes, or find the technology to allow planes to land or take off more quickly, and that they are all in place and that they are all compatible and they reflect themselves in the cockpit.;N
But the general question I have, this person said, and I will just be very blunt about it, that ``those FAA people, they are going to eat her alive.'';N
It is a good answer, and it is an important answer and you hit it immediately and you hit it hard.;N
The fact that you have been in the bureaucracy, so to speak, in fact does mean a great deal.;N
I think the American people have no sense of what it is that an FAA Administrator goes through, what they face, the pressures on them, that everything is real-time, instant, and funding is always short.;N
You have the advantage that aviation is one of the most high profile issues on the national agenda right now and very much, obviously, in terms of security.;N
Your interest is in safety, your interest is in getting people back into airplanes, your interest is in having planes take off on time, land on time, have them do it faster, but at the same time very safely.;N
Mr. Chairman, I move that John McCain be the Chairman of the Commerce Committee for this Congress.;N
Mr. Chairman, let me recommend for consideration, and you can take it up with the members, but now that we've grown to 22 members, you know, in the Appropriations Committee if we waited for opening statements for all 22, the poor witness would never get to testify.;N
So if we can just forego those or the Chairman or Ranking Member or whatever or if some Senator's got a particular interest, we always yield to exceptions.;N
What we try to do is convenience the entire Committee, of course, and mainly the witnesses.;N
Because as you mentioned, there are some times where it's a burning issue for a witness or of a particular interest to members of the Committee.;N
But perhaps we could informally adopt a general rule that we do as they do on the far more dictatorial Appropriations Committee that we restrict the opening statements to the Chairman and Ranking Member, except for those who might have a particular interest in the issue.;N
And members are then recognized in order of seniority going down to make comments before we take up amendments.;N
Mr. Mineta, I think it is appropriate that you be the witness before our first formal new convening of this Committee.;N
Because you as a Democrat I think are significant of the new Administration's bipartisanship and bipartisan approach to governing in this new millennium.;N
This Committee has as you know because of your previous visits here works in a bipartisan fashion as well.;N
We are pleased to see you before the Committee again and would like to acknowledge any of your family members who may be here.;N
Senator Carnahan, I am told by the staff that we have efforts under way to extend that side of the dais so that you will not be subjected to sitting with the press.;N
So, is there anyone who would like to make an opening statement or comments before we move to Senator Boxer and Congressman Dreier?;N
When I was the Vice Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Norm Mineta was the Chairman of the Public Works Committee.;N
And I think that his experience in transportation is not only welcome, but it absolutely necessary.;N
Because I think our transportation system in our country is under the most trial that it has been in a number of years.;N
Certainly in the aviation sector, I want to say I am very concerned about this new performance based organization for the FAA.;N
I hope that we will be able to monitor it closely and work out kinks if we find them quickly.;N
I secondly hope that we will adopt a policy of an intermodal system that works for our country.;N
We are in vast need of highway resources, especially in my State of Texas, that has the highest number of highway miles and the longest foreign border of any State in our country.;N
Mr. Chairman, as you have noted, Mr. Mineta is an American success story and I ask that my statement be made part of the record.;D
I will be introducing a bill shortly to try to truncate the procedure by which runways, additional capacity at our airports are put in place.;N
And I think we have got to really become aggressive in this legislation session to deal with that.;N
Mr. Chairman, I am just so delighted to be a member of your Committee, Senator Hollings and you, Mr. Chairman are great leaders on the issues that the Committee focuses on.;N
And the reason I can be brief is because know that our friend Norm Mineta is no stranger to you.;D
I was here introducing him when he was nominated to be the Commerce Secretary by President Clinton.;D
I would like to ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein's statement be inserted in the record at this time ;N
Briefly, I want to tell you that Norm Mineta represented the Silicon Valley in the House of Representatives for 21 years and I was happy to serve with him for 10 of those.;D
So he already is very familiar with the responsibilities of the Department of Transportation and transportation policy.;D
As Chairman of that Committee, he was the principle author of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.;D
And that landmark legislation expanded traditional highway legislation to include transit, pedestrian improvements, bike paths.;N
He has extensive knowledge about our aviation systems, as has been pointed out by Chairman McCain, from serving as the Chairman of the Aviation SubCommittee and serving on the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.;D
Since leaving the House, Mr. Mineta has served on several transportation related Federal commissions and advisory panels.;D
Mr. Mineta began his political career in 1967 when he became the first Asian Pacific American member of the City Council of his home town of San Jose, California which is as you know in the heart of the Silicon Valley.;D
Just 4 years later in 1971, he was elected the Mayor of San Jose, the first Asian Pacific American mayor of a major United States city.;D
While serving in the Congress, Mr. Mineta founded the Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus and he served as its first chair.;D
One area where I admire Norm so much, and I know so many of you do as well, was his fight to ensure the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which officially apologized for and addressed the injustices endured by Japanese Americans during World War II.;D
I want to say what a great honor it is for me to have joined Senators Boxer and Feinstein over the past week.;N
And I am particularly honored to be able to be here on behalf of my friend and former colleague Norm Mineta.;D
We have heard talk about air safety which is something that is of great concern to every single one of us.;N
As a Southern Californian, I have to say that we have a wide range of infrastructure problems which need to be addressed.;N
And that is why I believe that Norm Mineta will in this position as Secretary of Transportation do a superb job.;N
Last Saturday as we all listened to President Bush's inaugural address, I was struck with the alliteration in which he referred to the need for civility, compassion and character and courage.;N
And as we listened to the descriptions from our colleagues here of Norm Mineta, obviously, he comes to mind when we think of all of those words.;N
And I believe that if we look at the challenges ahead in this new millennium, infrastructure, transportation issues will be key at every level.;N
I am also very concerned about the globalization of our economy and the fact that we are going to need to make sure that we move goods and services that are coming in from all over the world going to and from.;N
And I believe that it is essential that we focus on and improve our infrastructure so that we are able to maintain our preeminence in this global economy.;N
So I am very pleased and proud as a Californian and as an American to wholeheartedly recommend and encourage the confirmation of our friend Norm Mineta.;D
And we know that you and Senator Boxer speak for all Californians as well as Americans in endorsing his new position in the Bush Cabinet.;N
Senator Stevens and I were just talking about why is it that they will not expand an airport in some parts of the country when it is clearly needed, when you must do that, and then complain about the lack of air service and the gridlock.;N
So we are going to have to take on some pretty powerful forces if we are going to reverse this trend which your Commission deemed inexorable.;N
And as you made reference, sooner or later, it is bound to have some effect on America's economy.;N
So I think one of our highest priorities working with Senator Hutchison, Senator Rockefeller and others is that we address this aviation issue and soon.;N
The American people deserve better than what they have been getting from their government.;N
And frankly, not just their Federal Government, but their State and local governments as well.;N
During the last 2 weeks of Secretary Slater's service, he awarded approximately $20 million in Federal funding to his home State of Arkansas for various transportation projects.;D
Just last week he awarded $4.8 million in grants for Arkansas Transit Airports and rural transportation studies.;N
Frankly, I believe this action by the Secretary given the timing raises questions about the justifications for such funding as well as the motives for the last minute awards.;N
What assurance can you offer this Committee that under your leadership the awarding of discretionary funding will be based solely on merit rather than politics or other inappropriate criteria?;D
And that under your watch there will not even be an appearance of personal or political favoritism in the awarding of discretionary funding?;N
And that is because the public demands it provide certain services that are non-economical.;N
If you had a wonderful Amtrak high speed train between New York and Miami and it did not have to stop in Columbus, South Carolina, Richmond, Virginia and 50 other places, it would make money.;N
And you have got more experience this minute than most Secretaries of Transportation had after their 4 years of service.;D
Yeah, if we want to leave out some of those cities and improve that road map, we need alternative solutions.;N
Otherwise, I want to answer the Chairman's question why the communities do not build added runways or airport facilities because they are no longer in charge.;N
You see, when I practiced law way back, the community of Charleston, for example, went out into the county, taxed themselves in the city, built the airport, got the tower up, went to Eddie Rickenbacker at Eastern Airlines and said can we get the service?;N
And after negotiations, we came up to the CAB, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and we said here is the service.;N
In fact, when I first got here, we had four airlines, National, Eastern, Delta and Piedmont.;N
I had the Vice President of U.S. Air in my office on a Wednesday, just like today, and asked U.S. Air how much a round trip ticket for my wife to Charleston and Washington back on Friday morning.;N
So what you have had with money controlling the competition is 85 percent of the small and medium sized towns of America subsidizing those long hauls to California and down from New York to Miami and then overseas and otherwise.;N
And more than anything else, if I have to go through Charlotte, U.S. Air controls 85 percent of the landings and takeoffs.;N
And we have got a bill in that we are looking at and we studied it in a judicious fashion to see if we can break up those hubs and get competition back again.;N
But somehow, some way you have got to understand the reality of the effects of pricing on the consumer.;N
I understood why you started choking a little while ago reading that stuff about average prices.;N
I mean, tell whoever is over at the Department not to write that out for you to read anymore.;N
And we just found out here in the past couple of years, Senator Graham, myself and others, that there is no security.;N
But let us say less than 2 percent of the containers coming in--I have got the fourth largest container port in the United States.;N
If you go to Long Beach, New York, these other big ports, less than 2 percent are even inspected.;N
Rather than sending the stuff up in flowers, they could easily just fill up containers and send 10 in and only one would be inspected.;N
We know up in New Jersey that they have got a 25 mile place where they are supposed to inspect.;N
You know now from the Cole blow up and explosion that they could well fill one of those containers and blow up the Port of New York.;N
They are competing to get the cargo in, move it in fast and getting it out and not having it delayed for inspection.;N
Because I am convinced most of the drugs coming in the country are right in those containers.;N
But let us break up those hubs and get some kind of competition back in the airlines and get the communities back.;N
They are the ones that built the facilities and everything else of that kind and got the service.;N
So the communities themselves can open up and get added service, add facilities there and everything else like that and bring back real competition like we had before this so-called deregulation.;N
I would remind our members and for the benefit of our new members, the practice on the Committee is to go from one side to the other by order of appearances so-;N
If there is any one place in the Administration in this period of time that should be totally and obviously bipartisan, it is your Department.;N
It is my judgment that we should have some way to get a certificate of need--if we can devise the process to get it.;N
If the need is there, we will have a constrained period of review and limited review as far as the courts are concerned.;N
More than 70 percent of our people within the State who travel from point-to-point go by air.;N
And when we look at it--we have the Commissions looking at it now, particularly NIOSH, National Institute of Occupation and Safety and Health.;N
At Dutch Harbor, the No. 1 fish port in the United States, the runway is 3,300 feet long and the jets, the 737s land.;N
We are at a point now I think where unless our aviation problems are solved, we will go downhill as a state.;N
I really think that what we need to do is find someway to put that concept of eliminating the delays and finding some way to increase the capacity of aviation as the No. 1 task for you.;N
In the days when we were a territory, we used to call--no ethnic slur involved--but we used to the call the Secretary of the Interior the Great White Father.;N
And I urge you to take a look at the role that your department has played in the past as far as our State and Hawaii.;N
What I would really like for you to do is to see if you can get together a group of task forces that would work with our Aviation Subcommittee, with the Aviation Subcommittee of the House and see if we can come up with a proposal for this new century of matching the airport capacity with the demands of the future and not just try to catch up with what has been delayed in the past.;N
My only real question to you is with regard to the role that you now play in terms of transportation, beyond aviation, what is the major task that you have in the Department.;N
Mr. Secretary, recently when the U.S./Japan bilateral air agreement was signed, it was hailed as a great step forward.;N
However, because of capacity constraints, we find that although our air carriers have the authority to provide service, no slots are available at Narita.;N
Someone suggested that we should make it an international policy objective to call upon the Japanese to open up Haneta to our air carriers.;N
Otherwise, it is just a paper agreement which is not helping the balance of payment or balance of trade.;N
At least in the interim, if they would open up Haneta, it would accommodate all carriers according to the contract and agreement.;N
But I would like to ask you what actions DOT can and will take, not only to look at the over scheduling of airlines at peak times at airports which cause delays even in the best of weather conditions, but also the general over scheduling of airlines period.;N
I understand that they are trying use the equipment as efficiently as they can, but the number of delays from having to fix parts on an airplane and the over scheduling at peak times I think must be addressed.;N
I think that what we ought to be able to do is to try to shorten that period of time in order to have that additional capacity and not try to suppress on the demand side.;N
Because to me as we try to deal with airport delays by acting on the demand side, I think that would really be the wrong way to go.;N
I think you are certainly on the right track for trying to compact those and have them run at the same time.;N
But I hope you will use the creativity and the knowledge that you have to continue to look for other ways to determine how much is really needed in that area, sort of a bottom up review of the regulatory morass that we have in that area.;N
But I have to tell you I am concerned about the board that has been appointed to run the ATO.;N
And I respect those who I know, but I think some of the backgrounds of the people on that board are not the technical backgrounds with the aviation experience that I think we need if we are going to have that very high area of responsibility for our air traffic control system rest in that board.;N
And will there be a system in which we can monitor, very carefully, the progress that is being made?;N
Mr. Secretary, let me second Senator Hollings' judgment about the amount of experience that you bring to this.;D
And it was a delight to sit with you in my office and I thank you for the time to examine some of these issues.;N
Obviously, you have just come into this with so much more background and understanding which will allow you to I think get off to a terrific start and we are all grateful for that.;D
If I could just--because we had time to talk and you have answered a number of the key questions, I want to flag a few things for the record if I can quickly.;N
I listened to Senator Hutchison talk about the needs, the infrastructure needs, and every comment thus far has underscored the degree to which we are behind the curve in terms of our capacity.;N
And I think that we are headed for an enormous collision here in the Congress at the current rate, given the President's adherence to the campaign.;N
If you look at the numbers, CVO will come out in a couple of weeks with the 10 year estimates on surplus.;N
When you finish with the Medicare set aside, Social Security, inviolate interest payments, you are down to about a $2.2 billion available sum of money available for tax cut and everything else.;N
When you finish with inflation and with population growth and with the amount of money that the military is going to come in and ask for which we all understand is very significant, you may be looking at this.;N
And there are going to be enormous pressures, not just within this Committee, but within all kinds of Committees here.;N
Despite the fact that there were some 2,600 rescues, 10,000--I mean, an extraordinary amount of increase in their requirements for drug enforcement, fishing enforcement, not to mention the increases in recreational boating and other things we look to them for.;N
And I just want to say that in point of fact, only if you include depreciation and capital expenses can you come up with a notion that somehow they are not doing a better job.;N
Actual operating expenses in fact the losses have decreased because there has been an increase in capital stock investment, increase in ridership, the Acela train now coming on and so forth.;N
We, it seems to me, are sort of locked into an absence of common sense here with respect to some of these problems.;N
I have prepared to join with Senator Wyden and others in reintroducing the passengers' bill of rights.;N
But it seems to me that it is only by creating sort of a shake up to the workings of the marketplace that were actually going to get people to recognize some realities.;N
Now, the Chairman has suggested a number of different ways we can approach that, but nobody has done anything.;N
Because we have allowed the airlines to increase volume and deliver a terrible service and create these pockets of monopoly which are not competitive, where they make up for the subsidy to attract more people than they really ought to be attracting in other markets, we deprive other entities of an intermodal transportation system from being competitive according to market forces.;N
If prices in fact reflected the cost of tickets for moving those numbers of people in and out of those places at peak times, more people might say, oops.;N
Amtrak cannot possibly be judged properly if it is not given the capital grants and capital expense investment capacity to be able to attract the ridership to take people from point A to point B on time and comfortably in a way that is competitive and decent.;N
You know, we can manage 5,000 aircraft in the air at one time in congested air space over Iraq without a collision, but we are not able to provide emergency relief through all of our technology to our own air system.;N
These are contradictions that I think most of our citizens are simply tired of putting up with.;N
And I think all of us here are really anxious to work with you with a realistic approach to all of this.;N
But unless we are prepared to invest, Mr. Secretary, in an intermodal system and give local communities the flexibility not to be locked into building a highway when they do not want to or to having to increase automobile traffic when that is not their first choice, but rather being able to keep the spirit of what we did both in ISTEA and TEA-21, I think we are going to have a very difficult time responding.;N
And I simply wanted to lay that out to you that we are really in need of a measure of honesty, a lot of hard choices are<plus-minus> put on the table and all of us need to step back from some of the easy political choice here and recognize that the long-term investment needs of this country are being deferred and deferred and deferred.;N
I finally might add the lost of productivity--the loss of productivity for the hours of our businesspeople spent, obviously, digitalization and Palms and the capacity to e-mail from your seat has alleviated some of that.;N
But nevertheless, the loss of face time, the amount of--numbers of goods and products that do not move expeditiously is costing this country literally billions of dollars and countless percentage points in productivity.;N
Secretary Mineta, we very much enjoyed listening to your remarks and your understanding of the importance of intermodalism and how all passengers and cargo work together.;N
In my experience as Governor, and I think all of us recognize here, that Federal transportation policy, especially insofar as roads are concerned, are as much environmental policy as they are transportation policy.;N
Concepts such as the Public Private Transportation Act which we passed in Virginia and other states are emulating the matter.;N
I am just reading here on the Coal Fields Expressway which will link West Virginia, Kentucky and Southwest Virginia together.;N
On Federal environmental studies needed on this expressway's impact on the Indiana brown bat and a small world Pagonia, two endangered species, could take up to a year to complete State transportation officials stated.;N
Now, this is consistent with Senator Hutchison's concern and what you are saying having these studies work concurrently.;N
A private company, Brown & Root and Repoca, are the ones who will be using this private/public transportation method.;N
But if you do not run these studies concurrently, that just delays this particular road project in Far South, West Virginia which has high unemployment.;N
I look forward to working with you on the third crossing and Hampton Roads which will be important for our port which has nearly doubled its containerized cargo capacity.;N
The Wilson Bridge, the tech way with the new crossing of the Potomac, high speed rail is generally being completed from Boston to D.C.;N
And I do think, Senator Hollings, it ought to stop in Richmond as well as Raleigh, Charlotte, Greenville, on down to Atlanta.;N
And I would like to ask you do you favor competitive bidding on Federal projects, open competitive bidding on Federal transportation projects?;N
On the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, our State of Virginia and Governor Gilmore have been trying to make sure that we have full open bidding on that contract.;N
The State of Maryland disagrees with the Commonwealth of Virginia on that in this compact.;N
And they want to have what are called these PLAs which have a great deal of concern that inhibits the ability of non-union contractors to do that work.;N
So that we could have full and fair open competition for that project and thereby not subjecting the taxpayers Federal or either states from overruns or added costs from having lessened competition in that bidding.;N
This is a project labor agreement which means that there is an agreement with the State of Maryland, but there is a compact for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge between Virginia, Maryland, and the District, the Federal Government promised well over $1.5 billion on this.;N
We in Virginia do not care to be hit with cost overruns because from studies usually if you only allow union contractors to work, that means that non-union folks cannot even compete for it or have to increase their wage scales.;N
So as I understand it, at the last moment, the State of Maryland, Governor Glendenning, and the State of Maryland asked for Federal approval of that.;N
And I hope you will review it in the concept of making sure we keep that project in line as far as costs are concerned.;N
And I think we need to use technology to think outside the box or outside the CPU as far as transportation matters are concerned.;N
And President Clinton last spring had an opportunity to sign an Executive Order on Federal workforce transportation, but he stripped away a provision to expand opportunities for Federal workers to telecommute from home.;N
I think telecommuting or teleworking is just a great idea to improve our quality of life, reduce commute times as well as improve air quality where people wherever possible and practical could work at home a few days out of the week using a computer.;N
Now, the Federal workers in this area, as you well know, the Federal Government is the largest employer in the metro D.C. area.;N
So I think that some of the studies, and Congressman Wolfe on the House side has worked on this extensively.;N
Some studies estimate as many as 470,000 workers could telework in the Washington, D.C. area, including 270,000 Federal employees.;N
Now, if all of them were to telecommute, that would eliminate 658,000 vehicle trips and more than 3.6 million vehicle miles.;N
So I would ask you to urge President Bush to sign such an Executive Order to expand teleworking opportunities for Federal employees in the Washington area.;N
And I would also ask you about maybe allowing at least within your agency within the Department of Transportation, an agency that has stated in its analysis of the original telework Executive Order proposal, ``properly deployed, telecommuting can be a valuable, simple, expedient and common sense addition to the remediation of growing traffic congestion.;N
So I would ask you to look at what was stated by the previous administration's Secretary of Transportation, seemingly very favorable to it, at least doing it within your agency and hopefully encouraging President Bush to do it for all Federal employees.;N
And I know that you are not, I do not think, at this time prepared to answer all of them because you need to obviously confer with the President and others in the Cabinet.;N
So what I would like to do with the time that I have is run through these and perhaps at the end save a little time so that you can give maybe a general response.;N
Let me say first that when Amtrak is brought up, many times the fight is made for Amtrak by the folks in the Eastern part of the country.;N
And I want to say that it may be a little known fact, and maybe it is my fault for not focusing on it, but now that I am on this Committee, I will more focus on it, that we have almost seven million passengers, Mr. Chairman and Senator Hollings, in the year 2000 who rode on Amtrak.;N
And if I just list the cities that are involved, you can see why it is so important to us: San Jose, I mentioned first, Oakland, Sacramento, Auburn, the Pacific surf liner that goes up the coast, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego.;N
I would think in this century looking ahead, Mr. Chairman, in this global economy, one of the most important things many of us believe is moving people and moving cargo and moving our mail and getting things done.;N
And I think if we take a slap at Amtrak and we do not get behind it, I do not think we can live up to being a world economic leader.;N
And so I want to ask you in writing if you could answer your general feelings about Amtrak.;N
But going through all the problems we are in our State with electricity which I will not go into, very, very complicated, deregulation, that no one seemed to be prepared for its ramifications and so on.;N
And I look at the SUVs and I see that they are treated like light trucks at 20.7 miles per gallon compared to 27.5 miles per gallon for cars.;N
If we were just to make that one change, Mr. Mineta, we would save a million barrels of oil every single day.;N
And we would not have to debate drilling and ANWR and other things because we could come in with all of that saved energy.;N
But every year, we have to look at the fact that 40,000 people are killed on our nation's highways.;N
And so I think the whole issue of traffic safety is one I want to get your philosophy on and your thoughts.;N
And I know that lots of members of this Committee, the Chairman, have taken great leadership on that.;N
We see that the SUVs, nearly two-thirds of deaths in SUVs are as a result of rollover accidents versus 22 percent in passenger cars.;N
And there is a rollover standard, but it was based on static measurement, not a dynamic test.;N
So I am interested in your view whether you would use the best science to develop an accurate rollover standard.;N
And since your questions were so encompassing and so illuminating, I would move at this time in order that after the vote at 11:30, we could have the Senate move to confirm Norm Mineta as Secretary of the Department of Transportation, that I would ask for--I would move that we move his nomination at this time, continue with the questioning until every Member has been able to complete their question.;N
Then we will, as soon as we break, Mr. Mineta, we will inform the majority leader that we have voted.;N
Now we will inform him so that when we go for a vote at 11:30, the recorded vote as I understand the schedule.;N
I am still getting used to not only this Committee, but I think I found the men's room a couple of times around here.;N
Obviously, being from a State like Nevada, we have a little bit of Federal land in our state.;N
And there is very important public lands highway funding that is controlled obviously by the Congress and by you.;N
It is supposed to be, from what I understand, the funding is supposed to be relative to the amount of public lands that you have in your state.;N
But despite this Congressional direction, we have an analysis that shows that Alaska, California, which should be a concern to you and to others from your state, Idaho and Nevada have been particularly disadvantaged to a total of about close to $80 million since TEA-21 became effective.;N
As an example, for instance, Washington, D.C. received $4.4 million in fiscal year 2001, compared with Nevada at $439,000.;N
Kentucky with only one million acres of Federal land received $2.3 million in fiscal year 2001.;N
Basically, this is the point I just wanted to raise--and I would like you to look into it.;N
And I do not expect obviously an answer today, but just wanted to raise this as a concern.;N
That if a fund is set up for a particular purpose, it would seem to me that it is only fair that it be used for that particular purpose.;N
This is true especially in a lot of the western states where we have huge tracks of Federal land and we have a lot of roads, and increasingly, we cannot use that land because of regulations and various things.;N
And we cannot gain revenue from those lands because property taxes are necessary to maintain those roads.;N
It is becoming more and more of a burden on states like the States of Nevada and California.;N
And so I would ask you to look into the funding formulas for that and maybe we can work together on possibly making some adjustments in the future.;N
I do not think that has ever been done by somebody in the Department of Transportation in a confirmation hearing before.;N
There are about four railroads that carry 95 percent of the products, bulk goods, et cetera in the nation.;N
And from that, they make 94 percent of the profits of all goods that are moved by rail in this nation.;N
Traditionally, Secretaries of Transportation have looked upon trucking firms, barges, airlines, railroads, et cetera, as the area of focus for the Department.;N
And they have paid far less attention with respect to those who put on the railroads, the consumers, the grain folks, coal folks, steel folks, chemical folks.;N
We all know that the Staggers Act said that 80 percent of all rails would be deregulated, but 20 percent would not.;N
And those 20 percent would be those that had a single--had all the competition to themselves.;N
The Service Transportation Board, the STB, is unknown by most members of our society and by many Members of Congress, what it stands for, much less what it does.;N
But bottlenecks, there are a number of us on this Committee who are very concerned about that particular word.;N
And the willingness of those very few, 50 when I came here 17 years ago, four today, of Class A railroads, that they will not share or allow each other to get into competition.;N
Now, railroads alone are not subject to the same antitrust laws as all the other forms of transportation.;N
But I would like to know that you are going to symbolize by the use of the word bottlenecks that you are going to be thinking about end use consumers and people who live and die by the railroads, and particularly those railroads that have a single line into their place of business.;N
And it is an interesting subject because it effects every single person in the United States of America, virtually every single one.;N
And yet it is an issue I have been working on for 17 years and have very little to show for it.;N
But it is an extraordinary problem, and somehow it has bypassed the Congress' focus and the American people.;N
You get air congestion and it is on the front page of USA Today everyday during the summer when people are traveling.;N
This problem is year round, constant and gets almost no attention, including from previous Secretaries of Transportation.;N
Let me make one little plug for something called the small community air service development program.;N
It has everything to do with what Senator Hollings and I are talking about and that is the possibility, and hope, of small communities being able to develop innovative approaches to improve access into their airports.;N
I happen to be one that supports the U.S. Airway-United Merger, American just announced its involvement with that merger.;N
And that is to put regional jets into markets within a period of 2 years after the merger is approved, instead of all the turbo props--which can really hurt large sections of rural communities--well, where U.S. Airway commuter cover, impacting economic development possibilities.;N
The reason I say that is that unless we can work these problems out so that there are regional jets as well as hubs and spokes, rural America will begin to disappear even more quickly than it is.;N
That aviation is now more important than highways in terms of business location decisions and will grow more so.;N
Two question areas that I want to ask you about, aircraft manufacturing and trucking, two areas.;N
We have got Cessna, Raytheon, Boeing, Emartia, all have manufacturing facilities there, aircraft.;N
A key concern that they have in working with the Department of Transportation is the approval process, the certification process, for new products that they bring out.;N
I think you would agree that the aviation safety is a major priority for the Department of Transportation.;N
Fortunately, manufacturers have developed numerous new products that could lead to major safety improvements in both commercial and general aviation.;N
However, they must go through an often byzantine FAA certification process for these new products.;N
I want to draw your attention to that and then ask if you would make streamlining the FAA certification process a priority so that safer and more efficient products could be brought to market.;N
But if that process can be reviewed and looked at for streamlining, I think the same is going to be important as we look at expanding capacity at our airports, particularly in environmental streamlining.;N
I think we do not change the requirements, but if you can streamline the process so it can be truncated, what we are looking at in the legislative approach.;N
We have had some discussion on that earlier and the hours of service issue was raised by Senator Boxer.;N
In my state, we move many of our products to market trucking, railroads, aircraft, but also trucking.;N
I think there is a safety issue that should be reviewed and should be carefully considered.;N
But also the impact, particularly in rural areas, of this hours of service requirement can have a very adverse economic impact and not a positive safety impact.;N
And I have had a number of groups, companies, independent truckers, a number of people contact me.;N
I would hope you would look at that and its impact I think actually could be substantially different, urban versus rural or long distances of trucking.;N
Because particularly if you are having to work out in a rural area and you are going say driving a drilling rig, driving something that then you work on, the way it is currently designed can have an adverse impact, particularly in rural areas.;N
I remember our long relationship that we had in the House of Representatives and the 14 years that I spent over on the other side and your enthusiastic support for my candidacy for the Senate which I never quite fully understood until I realized that when I left, you became Chairman over there.;N
I think that when you have had the experience and the background and the training that you have, as well as to serve in the Congress and to go out into the private sector and being willing to come back into government service is truly a really big sacrifice on your part.;D
And I think all of us are going to be much better for your willingness to serve in that capacity.;D
Let me deal with some questions along the lines I think that my friend Senator Rockefeller was talking about.;N
It seems to me that in order to have competition which you spoke of, you have to have competitors in order to compete.;N
And I know a number of others are getting very concerned about the consolidation of all of the industries in this country that we are commanding to be competitive.;N
What kind of concern is going to be expressed about this problem of overall consolidation?;N
We all know that it is not your Department's responsibility to approve or disapprove of the mergers, but you have to run the Department that these people play in.;N
And if all of a sudden you turn around, you've got one railroad and one airline and we do not have any competitors, you are not going to be able to do your job.;N
And I think with your background and experience and knowledge in these areas, you have to be a voice if you will, within this Administration to talk about competition and how important it is.;D
That is going to be one that is going to meet the needs of the American public, particularly in the area of transportation.;N
Whether it is communication, transportation, aviation, railroads, oil and gas, energy production.;N
The Senate in the last Congress passed by unanimous vote--Senator McCain and a number of Senators on this Committee worked very hard to compromise and get a natural gas pipeline bill out.;N
The Department has recently issued a final rule on pipeline safety for petroleum pipelines for liquid pipelines.;N
And it is my understanding that the Office of Pipeline Safety is preparing to issue a proposed rulemaking on natural gas pipelines.;N
I mean, what is good for oil pipelines does not necessarily fit the mode for natural gas pipelines.;N
The whole concept of running a so-called pig through an oil pipeline to detect any leaks is easy.;N
But you cannot do that with natural gas pipelines because they bend, they curve and it just does not work.;N
So I guess my recommendation to you is that to make sure when these rules come up--I hope Congress does this ourselves and gives you some guidance.;N
But make sure that the Department officials understand the major difference and that you have to have options available to get the job done.;N
I mean, my State and many of the members around here are very dependent and at the same time very concerned about the supplemental requests that the Coast Guard seems to live on.;N
Right now our Coast Guard is in the far off Islands of the Galapagos to try to help clean up a major environmental spill.;N
They are called on a regular basis to do this off our coast lines in addition to drug interdiction and military law type enforcement activities.;N
And I would hope that you would be supportive of that supplemental as it works its way trough the Congress including the integrated deep water system project where we are trying to modernize all these fleet of ships.;N
I mean, some of them are really antiques out there that we have given the Coast Guard more and more responsibility and less and less equipment to do it.;N
So this is a big item under the Department of Transportation and it should be given a great deal of support.;N
And Senator Breaux, it is our intention, unless there is objection, to put the pipeline safety bill back on the first markup.;N
And I want to thank you and Senator Hutchison and Senator Murray and former Senator Slade Gorton on this issue.;N
And it is very unfortunate that we did not pass that bill through the Congress in the last session.;N
I think we are going to see an increased use of natural gas over time rather than a decrease.;N
It did not take me more than 2 or 3 minutes to determine that you had encyclopedic knowledge about transportation in this country.;N
After your appointment, it was widely reported in the Chicago area newspapers that the first question then President-;N
elect, now President Bush, asked you was what do you think about the need for a third airport in Chicago.;N
As a former colleague from the House of Representatives I certainly can attest to not only your ability, but your knowledge on so many of the transportation issues because of your position in the House.;N
I am just delighted that you are willing to accept this position within this Administration.;N
I first want to address the issue of airline service, particularly to small- and medium-sized communities.;N
And I think one of your most difficult challenges will be how to address under served communities in this country.;N
And in particular, Senator Dorgan and I had asked for a report several years ago on the impact of deregulation on smaller communities and as one who represents Maine.;N
In addition, recently we saw the lottery of slots at LaGuardia to reduce the congestion at that airport.;N
But at the same time that we are trying to factor in and integrate into our aviation system regional jets.;N
One carrier was intending to provide regional jet service from Portland, Maine, to LaGuardia, but those slots were lost, even though there was an agreement with the FAA to allow those slots to be available for regional jet service between our State and LaGuardia.;N
So, if we are trying to encourage the incorporation of regional jets and improved air service to smaller communities across the country and yet we are having this enormous congestion at airports, small communities stand to lose first.;N
So immediately, we lost service from our largest community in Maine to LaGuardia on a regional jet.;N
We are not only losing service, but we are also seeing that even in terms of the type of equipment that will serve our State airlines do not have the slots to provide jet service.;N
And this one carrier, for example, made a major investment in regional jets to serve small communities, such as is in Maine.;N
So I think that you will have to examine many of the issues regarding airline service to rural communities in the state.;N
GAO certainly reinforced that notion from the standpoint that many communities have benefited, but many communities and states have not benefited from deregulation.;N
Because I do think that we have to incorporate rural states as a priority in our aviation system.;N
We will never be able to compete on an equal level with the more populated areas of this country.;N
Certainly in terms not only of population, but in terms of the type of aircraft that those communities are served with.;N
And so I hope that we find a way of incorporating smaller communities in our aviation system development and design.;N
Because otherwise, we are going to see, I think, an erosion of the kind of economic development in our states, in our communities.;N
And I would urge you to give that your highest consideration as you are developing your vision of the future of the aviation system.;N
In addition, I am very concerned by the Inspector General s report concerning customer service and the rising consumer complaints and with passenger dissatisfaction at an all time high.;N
And what can we do in the future to be able to address many of these complaints that have been persistent and consistent?;N
I hope you will give it great consideration because it is one of the issues that obviously has concerned us here on the Committee.;N
I will look at that issue as a matter of fact as a way of incorporating maybe a policy with respect to serving those communities.;N
As I understand it, there will be a consolidation of the State director between Maine and Vermont.;N
I gather you can understand the problems associated with the geography alone, especially in a State like Maine.;N
I am eager to work with you in the days ahead in addressing some issues involving our highways and mass transit.;N
But today I would like to draw our attention to two issues that are of paramount importance to my home state.;N
Preserving the more than 12,000 jobs and maintaining the hub in St. Louis as well as the maintenance of space in Kansas City is also of paramount importance to us.;N
American Airlines in its proposed acquisition of TWA's assets has pledged to keep virtually all the jobs, the hub and the maintenance space.;N
Now, while I understand and I certainly share the concerns of my colleagues that have already been expressed concerning the consolidation in the airline industry, I believe that we must recognize that there is a fundamental difference between the American TWA transaction and the other airline mergers that are currently being considered.;N
The primary difference with the American TWA Airlines deal is that TWA is a financially distressed firm that cannot be saved and cannot be revived without intervention like that proposed by American Airlines.;N
Could you please share your views on whether this transaction is distinct from other airline mergers that are currently being considered?;N
And as such, I am extremely interested in Boeing's ability to compete on a level playing field.;N
So it comes as no surprise that I am very concerned about the $4 billion in European government loans that are helping to fund a competing project, the Airbus A380.;N
The 1992 U.S./EU Civil Aircraft Treaty provides that government loans made on commercial terms are allowable only if the project is proven to be commercially viable.;N
If Airbus does not submit proof as Boeing has requested that the A380 project is commercially viable, what course of action would you pursue in your new role as Secretary of Transportation?;N
I think it is a wonderful thing that President Bush has selected you to head this Department for more than the obvious reason that you are so eminently qualified for it.;D
I have noted in my political career that Republicans and Democrats approached pouring cement and cutting ribbons with equal bipartisan enthusiasm.;N
And so I think it is a wonderful thing that he has picked such a fine man, a Democrat, to head this agency, this Department, so important to all of us now matter how we register politically.;N
In both the ISTEA and the TEA-21, Congress and the Administration have recognized the benefits of linking land use planning and transportation capital investments.;N
They produced benefits like leveraging private investment, providing predictability again, responding to local needs and reducing energy consumption and air pollution.;N
As you think forward to the reauthorization of TEA-21, do you anticipate that there will be opportunities to continue to move in this policy direction and further reward communities for making a commitment to better land use planning and transportation coordination.;N
I think you are very familiar with my State as a neighbor to yours and how committed we have been for many years now, for decades now, for land use planning, preserving prime farm and forest land, managing our growth in a way that reflects a higher quality of life.;D
As your neighbor to the north, we share a very important highway corridor and that is, of course, Interstate 5.;N
There are places, choke points, on that important interstate that I think warrant your attention and some priority.;N
One of them is at a point on I-5 that separates the city of Vancouver, Washington, from Portland, Oregon.;N
There are two lift span bridges there that create enormous amounts of congestion with the traffic on the Columbia River and the traffic between these two cities where many Washingtonians live, but then work in Oregon.;N
I think frankly it warrants a change, an improvement, if we are to eliminate some of these choke points.;N
I am hoping that there will be an opportunity to address these kinds of specific needs with you in the National Corridor Program.;N
And finally, Mr. Secretary, I would be interested in your views on the appropriate balance between passenger and freight mobility, whether you believe that the Department of Transportation should allocate more planning and resources to freight programs as well as passengers.;N
I think Senator Wyden and I would both welcome you back to Oregon as soon as you can come back and look at our transportation needs.;N
How would you feel as a passenger if you got in a taxi and said, you know, I have got two destinations in mind.;N
If you or I were to get on a plane this morning, no advance purchase, and to fly to North Dakota, Bismarck, it would be about $1,600.;N
But if we decided to go to your home in California, no advance purchase, we could do that for about $600, twice as far, less than half as much.;N
Or if you and I planned our trip and we did a 3-week advance or so, we could get a super saver, $560 to go to Bismarck, North Dakota.;N
And we are subsidizing the routes on the heavily traveled routes between big cities pairs.;N
If you went into a taxicab and they priced that way, you would think the person was just daft.;N
But it is the way it is priced everyday in this country for people who travel in Fritz Hollings' part of the country or my part of the country.;N
Now what we have is retrenched airlines that have come back into regional monopolies of sorts that are unregulated.;N
We will have three major airline carriers exacerbating the problem I have just described to you.;N
In my state, our public service commission estimates that we are over charged $100 million by the railroads.;N
I am sure you are aware that the railroad is the only industry in America that I am aware of that is not subject to the antitrust laws.;N
I have introduced legislation suggesting that any future merger proposals be subject to Justice review and antitrust laws.;N
But we have also introduced in this Committee the Rail Shipper Protection Act which no one has ever accused of speeding through this Committee.;N
In fact, it has had a minor form of incarceration I suppose in the sense that we introduce it and nothing happens.;N
But a number of us on this Committee feel very strongly that we ought to do something about this.;N
Pricing opportunities, if I can just give you one additional example, allow the railroads to say that a bushel of grain that is picked up in Iowa and goes from Iowa through North Dakota to the West Coast is actually charged less, pays a lower rate, than a bushel of grain that goes from North Dakota to the West Coast.;N
Put a carload of wheat on the track in Bismarck and move it to Minneapolis, you pay $2,300.;N
Why do we pay more than twice as much for hauling a carload of wheat about the same distance?;N
We have increasing chokeholds on the American consumer that relies--especially in states like North Dakota--relies heavily on transportation needs.;N
And we are paying an outrageous amount of money for it and subsidizing those in other parts of the country every day, in every way.;N
And my hope is that you will say I am going to be a tiger on this issue of concentration in airlines and rails and others.;N
Do you not sleep well because we see fewer and fewer companies and more and more concentration?;N
If my colleague would just bear with me one moment to ask would you be open to the suggestion of imposing the restrictions of a Justice review on future rail mergers?;N
Mr. Mineta, let me just say--and I think it will be in that report that is right next to you--there are just no plausible excuses for the airline industry's performance on passenger service.;N
For example, the Inspector General recently noted that the airlines know in a number of instances 3 or 4 hours ahead of time that there is going to be a significant delay and they will not go out and change the departure board.;N
There is just no explanation for not giving people timely, accurate information about their travel options.;N
And I want you to know, both because of our friendship and the importance of this issue to me, I am not calling for a constitutional right to fluffy pillows on airline flights.;N
Because we have got businesspeople, for example, wasting significant sums of money and time because they cannot get information, for example, even about bumping.;N
I am prepared to say that airlines ought to be able to sell a ticket if somebody knows that a flight is over booked.;N
But to keep people in the dark about their travel options the way this industry has done is unacceptable.;N
And I so look forward to seeing you at DOT and looking forward to your outstanding service.;N
I believe that there is supposed to be a report, Senator Wyden, on what the airlines have done that is supposed to be coming out, is it January?;N
May I say since I represent the world's busiest airport, Hartsfield, and the country's most delayed impacted airport, and since I just voted for your confirmation, we need that money for the fifth runway tomorrow afternoon.;N
Last year, Hartsfield handled some 78 million passengers and this number is expected to jump to an incredible 100 million passengers just at Hartsfield in 4 years.;N
As you may know, Dallas Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare and Denver International Airports, they all have five runways.;N
In 2005, with 100 million passengers expected and with just four runways, it is projected that each flight at Hartsfield will average 14 minutes of delay.;N
With five runways though, it is estimated that Hartsfield will be down to 5 minutes of delay per flight.;N
This decrease in delay is significant and it will benefit passengers not just in Georgia and in Hartsfield, but around the country it will have a ripple effect.;N
Because what seems to happen in Hartsfield has a ripple effect all over the nation's airway system.;N
We would love to be able to count on you and your department to help expedite Hartsfield's critically needed fifth runway and the money for it and would appreciate your checking that out at your earliest opportunity.;N
You are on record as a supporter for advance technology applications in the transportation industry.;D
As you may know, former Secretary Slater in the last 48 hours of his tenure chose to select only two projects out of the eligible seven to advance the magnetic levitation train, the Maglev deployment program competition.;N
The Atlanta to Chatanooga route actually, not just Atlanta, but from Hartsfield to Chatanooga.;N
Because even with the fifth runway, it may be that we max out so to speak Hartsfield maybe as early as 2010.;N
If you could commute in effect from Hartsfield to the Chatanooga Airport, by magnetic levitation train at 220 miles an hour, I think that would dramatically improve not only ground transportation in a massive growth corridor in the southeast, but it would tremendously facilitate relief at Hartsfield.;N
I just like to throw that plug in because it did seem to me that--and I was told that Atlanta ran a close third.;N
And as a booster of that program, I would like for you to continue to take a look at that corridor because it seems to make sense in so many ways.;N
May I just say that I held a Senate roundtable I call it on rail and on a lot of transportation issues in my state.;N
And Secretary Slater in looking at the many transportation problems in Atlanta, Hartsfield, the interstate system, the question of commuter rail, the question of rapid rail coming down through the Carolinas via Amtrak and the magnetic levitation train, all of these issues converging in effect on metropolitan Atlanta having the longest commute of any metro area in America and the most traffic gridlock of any area in the Southeast.;N
Secretary Slater agreed to establish a DOT task force of officials from the various transportation modes in DOT to work with our newly created Georgia Regional Transportation Authority.;N
We now have locally a way to get a handle on all of these forms of transportation to plan them better, to integrate them better and to really move for the first time in our history to a balanced transportation system.;N
I thought it was a good idea for the Secretary to like in effect establish a task force to deal with this problem regionally.;N
So that we wouldn't be playing off one form of transportation against the other and trying to run through six or seven different offices in DOT just to try to get together and even have a meeting.;N
And if it works there, you never can tell whether it might be a good idea for other major areas.;N
And it is going to be my pleasure and privilege to work with you and I just cannot think of a better person to be in your position.;N
And we look forward to working with you on all these issues that come before this Committee in terms of transportation.;N
Mr. Secretary the Department of Transportation has sought reauthorization of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act for the last several years without success.;N
In Houston, Texas, we had a terrible hazardous materials transporting truck accident that really endangered many lives.;N
It is my understanding that the stumbling blocks have come primarily from dealing with exemptions for farmers and some of the disagreements about authorization in the Department of Transportation or Department of Labor and who handles what.;N
Will reauthorization of this act be a priority for the Department of Transportation under your leadership?;N
But, of course, aviation, we had the terrible accident in Florida which we all remember as well.;N
Five years ago, Congress changed the definition of commercial motor vehicle to include commercial passenger vans carrying nine or more passengers.;N
Last month, the Department finally issued the notice of proposed rulemaking to apply most of the Federal Motor Carrier safety regulations to these vans when they are carrying passengers for more than 75 miles.;N
This is an important safety issue in a border State because these vans sometimes called Camionetas operate across great distances without proper safety regulations.;N
Third, I have said this to the last two Secretaries of Transportation and I am going to say it again.;N
I would ask that you look at all of our bilaterals and I would hope that we would have a priority of fair and open skies when you are dealing with the other countries in establishing more routes and more potential destinations from Heathrow, China, Japan and other places where we would like to have more access.;N
And last, Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say in the earlier questioning, there has been a lot of talk about Amtrak.;N
And I just want to say that I believe all modes of transportation have subsidies from taxpayers, capital subsidies, not operational.;N
And I think we should all strive to make Amtrak self-sufficient operationally, but we should not starve them and the capital needs that they may have.;N
When we see the overcrowded airports, the overcrowded highways, there is just no question that we need to keep the rail passenger capability to have an overall transportation system in our country.;N
I would just like to ask you if you are also of the view that that is part of our overall intermodal transportation system for our country and will it be a priority for you to work with Amtrak.;N
Will you try to make them as efficient as they can be and go for operational subsidies presumably to be lessened and eventually eliminated, but not walk away from the capital needs?;N
Well, I thank you for that and I agree with you that we cannot starve them with capital needs and then expect them to be operationally sufficient.;N
But I also would say that unlike the other modes of transportation, if we lose the rail system, I do not think we will ever be able to regain it.;N
Because if we lose the railroad tracks or they deteriorate or they no longer are going to be able to be long enough to make sense, we will not be able to buy the right of way to ever bring back rail.;N
So as we are looking at the long-term and the growth in our country and the growth in the economy of our country, I just would urge you to make rail a priority as a part of that intermodal system rail will take some of the burden away from highways and away from our airports.;N
And if we fail to save Amtrak and the railroads for freight, we are not ever going to be able to recapture it.;N
So I do not think it is quite the same as the other transportation modes from that standpoint.;N
I strongly recommend that you look at the Department of Transportation Inspector General's report on Amtrak.;N
It is its continuing operating losses, something that we were assured of would not happen by the year 2002 when we bailed them out for the last time.;N
In 1971, when Amtrak was formed in 3 years they would not need any further infusion for operating costs of Federal dollars.;N
Since then, I have forgotten how many billions and how many restructurings and how many times we have come to Congress.;N
There have been numerous efforts to back door this Committee's authorization by sticking into appropriations bills and tax bills.;N
Well, they put in $15 million for them on the agriculture appropriations bill so that they could use GSA automobiles.;N
So I strongly recommend, Mr. Mineta, that you look at the history of Amtrak, you look where we are going and you look at that overall passenger ship has not increased in the last 10 years.;N
And I think you will feel that any objective observer of Amtrak will tell you what we are going to end up with.;N
We are going to end up with the northeast corridor and we are going to end up with a far west of it.;N
And that there is nobody that believes that anywhere in between that you are going to have economically viable train systems running for passengers.;N
We need to debate in the Congress and tell the American people that as other countries, the Europeans and others, we need to continuously subsidize Amtrak forever.;N
I think we gave $3 billion the last time, three or four billion dollars the last time that they were going to become independent by some years in the future.;N
So what we need to do on this issue is not continuously back door appropriations as they just attempted to do.;N
The Senator from Texas colleague, Senator Gramm, just blocked a $10 billion infusion to them that again was done without a hearing, without any authorization, but was going to be stuck into the omnibus appropriations bill, something that is incredibly offensive to me as the Chairman of the authorizing Committee.;N
There is no one who is more respected before this Committee than the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation, Mr. Ken Mead.;N
I think he will paint a very different picture about the prospects of Amtrak ever being independent even from operating costs, particularly with the labor cost and obligations that they have in the future.;N
I think it is important that the tax paying citizens from my State not be asked to pay their tax dollars over an over again for a transit system which has basically disappeared from our state.;N
And I think that perhaps in the spirit of patriotism, they should subsidize a northeast transit system and one in the far west.;N
But at least they deserve the full and certain knowledge of what is going to be expected of them.;N
Since 1971, the promises made about Amtrak consistently have not come to fruition and that is a matter of record which by the way I will provide for the record.;N
And at least the American people deserve honest and forthright evaluation of how much it is going to cost them in the future.;N
And again, I would ask you to talk to people who do not have a vested interest in Amtrak, people who are observers and experts on national transit systems.;N
That we are going to have to subsidize not just their capital expenses, but their operating expenses for the foreseeable future.;N
Mr. Chairman let me also tell you how excited I am about the opportunity to serve on this very important Committee with you as Chairman.;N
Well, we have a situation now, for example, where U.S. Air flies out of Baltimore through Charlotte to New Orleans and the fare is about $200, two hundred and some odd dollars.;N
If you get on that same airplane in Charlotte and fly to New Orleans--in other words, you make half the trip--it is $800 or $900.;N
And I think that is the direct result of U.S. Air having to compete with Southwest Airlines in Baltimore.;N
I guess all I am asking is I hope you will help work with me to find some creative ways to enhance competition if we possibly can.;D
I am happy to tell you that the vote on the floor is completed and by a very narrow margin, 100 to nothing, you were confirmed.;N
And I hope we can find time off the floor to proceed, and I hope that we can move them through the entire Senate.;N
I think all of them bring a great deal to commend them for public service, and I am proud to support them.;D
In at least one of the circumstances today, a Democratic seat on the Federal Communications Commission, which is to be filled by a recommendation of the Minority Leader, was offered to the White House, now nearly 2 years ago.;N
And that was not sent down to the Congress, deliberately so, showing, in my judgment, an arrogance and a partisanship that is very unusual.;N
And my profound hope is that, with respect to nominees that are both Republican-designated seats and Democratic-designated seats in these key agencies, that we'll be able to work together in the future and not have this sort of nonsense happen.;N
And while I am pleased that we are finally going to see progress on it today, I must make the comment that those who engineered this at the White House, in my judgment, did no real service to public service as a result of their behavior.;N
The folks who are going on the CPB, we'll be watching you and what you're doing over there in public broadcasting.;N
And Mr. Adelstein, of course--very supportive of his nomination and his confirmation back to the FCC.;N
He's been a tremendous help to all of us who have been tackling the rural issues in communications and universal service and those kind of issues, and we appreciate your support and working with us.;D
We've still got some challenges ahead with universal service, and, of course, the e-rates, and the rural areas still are--and the buildout of broadband is still of concern to most of us.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing, even at, hopefully, the last two or 3 days of this session.;N
I want to say to Mr. Adelstein, in particular, I appreciate the fact that your papers have been processed and that you're here this morning.;N
I have participated, over the years, in a little harassment of this gentleman, but my doubts have been absolved.;N
And I've regretted that he had to be treated the way he has been in the process of being renominated.;N
I think he's thoughtful and a good member, and I think he deserves to be reconfirmed, and I'll be supportive of that in every way I can be, as I have been in the past, and I think you know that.;D
I have worked assiduously with people in public broadcasting in my state and with the CPB, because I believe that there were real problems that could be addressed internally by having good men and women on the Board and trying to carefully and slowly and thoughtfully and appropriately change the mindset, the bias, the negativity, the overall attitude of, you know, the entities you're responsible for.;N
I'm getting real tired of having people crawl on my case everywhere I go about the continued attitude and arrogance and bias of NPR.;N
Now, I'm going to have to go to another meeting, but I'd like to just lay the question out.;N
But, I mean, the tears and the crying and the weeping and gnashing of teeth the day after the election just almost made me gag.;N
And so--you know, but the Public Telecommunications Act of 1992, under Section 19, says that there must be strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs, or a series of programs, of a controversial nature.;N
I'm not saying take one particular point of view, or the other, but there are still huge problems out in the real world.;N
I'd like to mention, I did meet with the CPB nominees prior to the hearing, and I warned them that perhaps they might be addressing some issues of some controversy concerning both CPB and NPR, and I--look, I think those are legitimate questions.;N
I think that when the taxpayers' dollars are involved, clearly we have an additional obligation than we do to any network or independent radio or television station, and I--so I think your points are well made.;N
It wasn't clear to me whether Senator Lott was alleging that it was too conservative or too liberal.;N
I guess the guy out there that runs the Historical Society picked up his history book from a seventh-grade student, thumbing through it, they had a full page on Marilyn Monroe, but a quarter page on George Washington.;N
We are pleased to have with us this morning Senator Tim Johnson, who would like to make some remarks about the nominee.;N
And, also, I know that Senator Allen was here earlier, and he wanted to, of course, welcome our nominees, as well.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this important hearing to consider nominations, including the renomination of Jonathan Adelstein to continue to serve as a member of the Federal Communications Commission.;N
Senator Daschle worked tirelessly to ensure that as the first FCC Commissioner from South Dakota and the entire upper Midwest, I could continue to help ensure that all consumers, including those in Rural America, remain connected.;D
In that effort, a bipartisan chorus of support from our state has joined him, and I am grateful to Governor Mike Rounds, PUC Chairman Bob Sahr, and to many others for their support.;N
Growing up a fourth-generation South Dakotan, with long winters and people scattered over large distances, I learned the value of all of us staying connected, to each other and to the rest of the country.;N
That experience drives me to work hard to fulfill the Communications Act's promise for innovative communications technologies and services that are widely available to everyone in this country.;N
These goals become even more imperative as communications takes an ever more prominent role in our personal lives and in our global economic competitiveness.;N
With advances in technology and today's security environment, I will also continue to put the communications needs of our public safety and national security communities at the forefront.;N
The telecommunications industry is at a crossroads, driven by the rise of broadband and its revolutionary implications.;N
From telecommuting, to distance learning, to high definition video, to telemedicine, broadband breaks through geographic barriers and transforms communities.;N
We must continue to encourage broadband deployment by increasing incentives for investment and promoting competition.;N
We can do both with a policy framework that is flexible and keeps pace with rapid technological changes.;N
To promote these benefits for everyone in this country, I have focused on improving spectrum management, modernizing universal service, and protecting diversity, competition, and localism in our media.;N
I have set out an approach I call a ``Framework for Innovation'' that establishes ground rules for issues like interference, while, to the greatest extent possible, allowing innovation in the marketplace to drive the development of spectrum-;N
My goal is to maximize the communications and information that flow over the nation's airwaves.;N
We have achieved remarkable results, on a bipartisan basis, by improving our spectrum management policy.;N
The marketplace has responded with an explosion of new opportunities for consumers, like wi-fi and new licensed wireless broadband services.;N
Our entire country gains economic, social, and civic benefits from being connected to a seamless ``network of networks.'';N
Increasingly, voice, video, and data will flow to homes and businesses over broadband platforms.;N
In this new world, we must promote a comprehensive rollout to all Americans, including those from rural, insular, and other high-;N
cost areas, Native Americans and other minorities, people with disabilities, non-English speakers, and low-income consumers.;N
As for the media, I have never forgotten that the airwaves belong to the American people, and that it is critical to preserve their access to what the Supreme Court has called the ``uninhibited marketplace of ideas.'';N
The FCC should continue to promote the priorities that have always formed the basis of our public interest policy as envisioned by Congress: diversity, competition and localism.;N
Congress has charged the Commission with ensuring that the American public stays well-connected and well-protected.;N
If confirmed, I will continue to work with each of you to implement these Congressional imperatives.;N
Senator Daschle also charged me with helping to develop a comprehensive congressional technology agenda which Senator Daschle and Representative Dick Gephardt unveiled live on the Internet in April 2001.;N
It contained a detailed series of proposals to spur innovation, productivity, economic growth and job creation.;N
This effort required extensive consultation with each of the many Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over technology issues and the many Members of Congress with an interest in these issues.;N
This exercise helped me establish a broad vision for promoting U.S. technological development in which the FCC, along with many other Federal agencies, plays an important role.;N
I have also worked with Senator Daschle on initiatives to promote efficient spectrum management, improve the availability of local-to-;N
local television service to all regions of the U.S., and to establish the validity of electronic signatures and numerous of other telecommunications initiatives.;N
As Senator Daschle's leading banking and financial services advisor, I have also gained a solid understanding of the operations and structure of the capital markets, which remain crucial in the financing and development of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure overseen by the FCC.;N
For example, I worked on every aspect of the landmark legislation to revamp the financial services industry, the Gramm-Leach-;N
This experience provided me with great perspective on the latest developments in a field which plays a key role in the future of the telecommunications industry.;N
Moreover, I have participated in the multi-year effort to enact bankruptcy reform, the commercial aspects of which are unfortunately playing an increasingly prominent role in the structuring of the telecommunications industry.;N
In my previous staff position for the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I undertook a number of in-depth investigations and organized a number of hearings, many of which led to changes in Federal law or reforms of executive agency practices and organizational structures.;N
This experience in exploring the depths of complex issues, and learning how to conduct Federal investigations and organize fact-finding hearings will help me, if confirmed, to evaluate the complex field of telecommunications.;N
Moreover, this oversight experience provided valuable insight into the management of large and complex Federal agencies and how to address bureaucratic problems that can have an adverse effect on the public which relies on those agencies.;N
In this position, I also learned first-hand the importance of affordable telecommunications services to senior citizens and their families.;N
I served as the primary advisor to Senators Pryor and Riegle on some of the largest programs in the Federal budget which fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee on which they served.;N
This responsibility rapidly developed my ability to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal programs, initiate specific proposals for improving them and forge a bipartisan consensus in order to get changes enacted or otherwise approved by Federal agencies.;N
This experience would aid me, if confirmed, in confronting the many challenges to the efficient functioning of the FCC.;N
My undergraduate and graduate education focused on how American history, political science, economics and public policy analysis could be employed to improve the functioning of government.;N
My political science studies at Stanford, followed by my studies there to attain a Masters in history, helped me to better understand the context in which government decisions were being made.;N
I furthered my studies at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where I gained valuable lessons in economics, statistics and public policy analysis.;N
In sum, I have had the privilege of studying and serving in capacities that have provided a unique level of experience, exposure and education about Federal Government processes, including those involving telecommunications policy.;N
I have dedicated my career to public service in the United States Senate, working for some of its finest members.;N
I can imagine no greater training ground to prepare an individual for the enormous responsibility of implementing the complex and often disputed telecommunications laws enacted by Congress.;N
Public service has afforded me the opportunity to make some concrete contributions to what I, and the members I served, considered to be in the public interest.;N
This country and my home state of South Dakota have given so much to me and my family that no amount of giving back in the form of public service can ever repay the gratitude I feel.;N
My mother's family found safe haven here from the holocaust as they escaped Nazi-occupied Poland.;N
My father's family found safe haven here from the pogroms in Russia around the turn of the century.;N
My great-grandmother homesteaded near the Badlands of South Dakota, and my grandfather went on from there to found a business that became one of the largest employers in the state.;N
Now, based on the extraordinary opportunities and education I have been afforded in the Senate and at fine educational institutions, I would like to use my experience to promote the public interest as envisioned by Congress in its communications laws.;N
The FCC has before it perhaps the most exciting challenges of any agency in promoting the development of telecommunications and information technologies and services during a time of economic difficulty in the industry and security threats to our country.;N
I would like to work toward achieving bipartisan solutions that maximize the ability of the Commission to contribute to productivity, economic growth and improved security for the entire country.;N
Having been born and raised in one of the most rural states in the country, South Dakota, and given my experience working on behalf of South Dakota for seven years in Senator Daschle's office, I see the value of quality communications and media services in people's lives.;N
My experience has taught me that these services can make a positive contribution to economic development, education, public safety, and the quality of health care services available to people in need, In rural areas like the one where I was raised, the availability of the most advanced communications technology can determine whether a small community can offer an economic future to its citizens, and can even mean the difference between life and death in the case of medical emergencies.;N
It is also clear that enhancing the quality of the nationwide telecommunications infrastructure improves the overall economy by increasing the productivity and efficiency of the entire Nation.;N
If confirmed, serving at the Commission will provide me with an opportunity to promote the transforming power of communications and media services in people's lives.;N
The FCC has been charged by Congress with a key role in fostering competition, innovation and universal service.;N
Advanced technologies can connect people to new opportunities and obliterate the distances between them.;N
They can contribute to our quality of life, and keep this country competitive in the global economy.;N
If confirmed, I will work with the other Commissioners and the many talented people at the Commission to help improve the telecommunications economy and promote the deployment of the most advanced technologies to every region and sector of American society, as envisioned by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.;N
3. What goals have you established for your first two years in this position, if confirmed?;N
If confirmed, my goals are to work toward expanding access to telecommunications services for all Americans, including broadband services, to help restore the economic vitality of the telecommunications sector, and to address emerging public safety and security needs.;N
In pursuing these goals, I will strive to faithfully carry out the communications laws enacted by Congress, consistent with Congressional intent ascertained from a plain reading of the statute and its legislative history.;N
In order to accomplish this most effectively, I will work to keep open and improve communications with Members of Congress and their staffs.;N
Working firmly within that framework, I will seek to realize the goal of improving the economic climate of the telecommunications industry, which is currently witnessing an historic downturn, so that continued innovation, investment and deployment can improve the level of services available to consumers.;N
This effort can be accomplished in part by working toward the statutory goal of the Act itself, which calls for extending the availability of advanced telecommunications technology to all Americans in all regions including the ubiquitous deployment of broadband.;N
Finally, our country must have the most reliable and sound telecommunications infrastructure in order to meet new and emerging threats to our security.;N
Addressing the needs of the public safety community must remain at the very forefront of the Commission's agenda.;N
4. What skills do you believe you may be lacking which may be necessary to successfully carry out this position?;N
It would be difficult for any individual to master the intricacies of all of those many areas of jurisdiction.;N
Recognizing these difficulties, despite my years of experience in this field, I will examine even more intensively the many issues arising before the Commission, taking advantage of the greater access to information available to Commission members.;N
I realize that many different challenges face the legislative branch and independent regulatory agencies of government.;N
If confirmed, in making the transition to the FCC, I will need to reach out to the many experienced and skilled public servants within the Commission.;N
Moreover, I will also draw on the experience of leading outside experts, including those in academia and public interest groups, and that of the many leaders in the telecommunications industry.;N
I will also reach out to regular consumers and residents of rural areas to learn about their perspectives.;N
Telecommunications is a rapidly changing field and I will need to refine my knowledge constantly to keep abreast of these changes.;N
I am confident this can be accomplished by drawing on the seasoned Commission staff and leading technologists from outside the agency.;N
Include a discussion of when you believe the government should involve itself in the private sector, when should society's problems be left to the private sector, and what standards should be used to determine when a government program is no longer necessary.;N
The United States was founded upon a Constitution that carefully enumerates powers available to the Federal Government, and places limits on those powers.;N
The American Revolution was largely a response to abuses of power by an unaccountable king.;N
Emerging from this beginning, the U.S. has, historically and properly, retained a skeptical view of the role of government power.;N
Most importantly, it vested responsibility for limiting the encroachment of government into the private sector and people's lives not only through the Bill of Rights, but through a sound democracy.;N
For officials in a regulatory agency such as the FCC, it is imperative not to exceed the authority delegated to the agency by Congress when applying regulations to the private sector.;N
Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and regulators must restrain themselves from using their congressionally delegated authority to exceed the limits of congressional mandates.;N
I consider the necessity for such judicial action a failure to interpret congressional intent in implementing the law and, if confirmed, would strive to avoid such failure.;N
In my view, which happens to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act, competition is preferable to regulation as a means of encouraging innovation, lowering prices and improving the quality and availability of services to consumers.;N
Some sectors of the telecommunications industry are already witnessing a competitive market, while others are still making the transition.;N
A greater government role may be needed to facilitate competition in less open markets, and government action may be necessary to stimulate service in other instances in which the market fails to address essential societal goals, such as the deployment of the advanced services to rural areas.;N
In these exceptional circumstances, to make markets work best, the government should operate in a fair, clear and open manner, establishing frameworks that are technologically and competitively neutral.;N
The goal must always be to get to the point where market forces and competition render governmental regulation unnecessary.;N
Once that point is achieved, the regulatory environment should diminish deftly and appropriately.;N
In terms of when government programs are no longer necessary, section 10 of the Communications Act provides useful guidance.;N
This provision authorizes the Commission to discontinue applying regulations that are no longer needed to prevent discrimination or other unjust practices or charges, or to protect consumers.;N
This provision specifically requires the Commission to weigh whether or not eliminating a regulation could enhance competition.;N
In general, I agree with the proposition that a program or regulation is no longer needed when the market failure it was designed to correct has been addressed.;N
For example, the government has historically promoted universal service in areas such as postal service and telephone service.;N
It has also established a national highway system, and promoted universal access to electricity.;N
In these cases, government has worked in close cooperation with the private sector to accomplish laudable goals.;N
Whenever possible, the government should attempt to work in partnership with the private sector to address policy goals in areas where competition or the market alone might not accomplish them to the satisfaction of policymakers in Congress.;N
It is a core, bipartisan American value that the government should act to secure universal service for its citizens.;N
This policy goal, when met, enhances the value of the telecommunications network for all who use it, whether as consumers or providers.;N
In your own words, please describe the agency's current missions, major programs, and major operational objectives?;N
The FCC is an independent regulatory agency created by the Communications Act of 1934 to oversee emerging communications technologies by wire and radio.;N
Its mission has been expanded by subsequent amendments to include television, satellite and cable.;N
It is charged with carrying out the responsibilities conferred upon it by Congress to help ``all the people of the United States'' benefit from the best telecommunications system possible, and to do so at reasonable rates.;N
In short, the FCC regulates radio and television broadcasters, wire common carriers, wireless and satellite communications providers, as well as multichannel video programmers, and helps coordinate international and satellite policies.;N
The FCC oversees the administration of universal service support programs, including high-;N
It enforces the Communications Act requirements in these fields and handles public inquiries and consumer complaints.;N
The FCC's mission, as detailed in the statute, is to facilitate competition, promote universal service and technological innovation, and to protect the public interest.;N
Much of its recent activities has involved implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.;N
Operationally, the FCC currently oversees a vast array of regulations that it must continually enforce and evaluate in light of changing market conditions and technological change.;N
It must also respond to input from Congress, and to any changes that Congress enacts to its current mission.;N
In reference to question number six, what forces are likely to result in changes to the mission of this agency over the coming five years?;N
The FCC's fundamental mission will change only to the extent that Congress amends the laws governing the agency, or that competition develops in a manner that obviates the need for regulation.;N
Even if such fundamental developments do not occur, however, in certain areas the agency will confront the need to respond to technological innovation, and to accommodate rising demand for spectrum and new wireless technologies, as well as to respond to significant changes in the marketplace that may emerge.;N
In further reference to question number six, what are the likely outside forces which may prevent the agency from accomplishing its mission?;N
While outside forces are presenting challenges to the FCC, I am hopeful none of them will prevent it from accomplishing its statutory mission.;N
One great outside challenge now facing the agency is that changes in revenue streams are placing pressure on universal service, which may complicate efforts to ensure its sustainability and to encourage the deployment of advanced services.;N
Secondly, increasing demands on spectrum are straining the ability of the agency to balance the need to promote the deployment of advanced wireless telecommunications services with the essential needs of national security and public safety.;N
Third, the Commission will need adequate resources to carry out its mission as the telecommunications environment grows ever more technologically complex.;N
It will be a challenge to attract and retain the best-trained specialists in the fields of telecommunications technology, economics, and law unless resources keep pace with the demands placed on the agency.;N
In further reference to question number six, what factors in your opinion have kept the department/agency from achieving its missions over the past several years?;N
The agency can improve communications with Congress so that emerging problems can be addressed in the most cooperative manner possible.;N
In addition, the judicial review process has led increasingly to inconsistent interpretations of the law, in some cases due to inadequate efforts to provide objective justification for some of the regulatory positions the agency has taken.;N
There is also a need to show more dedication to expeditiously and responsively addressing section 254 of the Telecommunications Act in light of the changing nature of the marketplace.;N
The primary stakeholders are residential and business consumers of telecommunications services.;N
Congress, which created the agency, is also a primary stakeholder which is accountable and responsive to those consumers.;N
Telecommunications businesses that provide services to consumers are, of course, key stakeholders.;N
Others include the White House, related executive branch agencies, state regulators, and international governments.;N
What is the proper relationship between your position, if confirmed, and the stakeholders identified in question number ten?;N
It must act to preserve its independence if its decisions are to be regarded as objective and fair.;N
Given this position, the agency must always keep focused on its mission, as embodied in the Communications Act, to protect consumers and promote the public interest.;N
As such, it is imperative that Commissioners maintain close communications with Congress so as to reflect most accurately its intentions with regard to the law and attend most efficiently to Members' concerns as raised by their various constituencies.;N
Commissioners should work cooperatively with outside stakeholders, listen carefully to their concerns, and respond to those concerns in a manner consistent with the law.;N
Commissioners should hear and consider fully the competing visions of the many providers of telecommunications services and evaluate what outcomes would best serve the public interest as intended by the Act.;N
All stakeholders should be heard and treated fairly, but none should be granted any special treatment in terms of access or outcomes.;N
The Chief Financial Officers Act requires all government departments and agencies to develop sound financial management practices similar to those practiced in the private sector.;N
a) What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure your agency has proper management and accounting controls?;N
If confirmed, I will consider it my responsibility to work closely with and oversee agency management and administrative personnel, and help to ensure a clean audit.;N
The Act specifies that the Chairman is to serve as the chief executive officer of the Commission, and the Commission has hired a Chief Financial Officer.;N
At the same time, all Commissioners are responsible for overseeing and assisting with the management of the agency in order to comply with statutory mandates.;N
I will seek to work closely with these officials to help establish the most effective organizational structure and the most efficient use of the budgetary resources provided by Congress.;N
In terms of what will most closely fall under my purview if confirmed, I will employ diligence and careful scrutiny in administering the resources of my office.;N
And I would encourage the FCC, in their deliberations, to remember that it was not only the sentiment expressed by this Committee, chaired by our great leader from Arizona, but it was also the entire Senate, in an overwhelming vote, that gave you direction on this issue of media ownership and then the tangential issue of the cross-ownership.;N
"And we have an additional incentive for freeing up spectrum; it's called the 9/11 Commission Report.";N
Mr. Chairman, since we have two of our distinguished citizens from my state here, I would want to pick up on Senator Lott's comments earlier that he's concerned the partisan and divisive nature that has gotten into this political discourse.;N
I'm glad for your last comment there, because of my concern about media consolidation, and especially in public broadcasting, that there be some flexibility for local decisionmaking.;N
I mean, my sense is that the next Congress will spend a fair amount of time, particularly on this Committee, talking about that issue.;N
I think you've been quoted as saying government should not use the universal service fund to fund competition for competition's sake.;N
I don't want to see rural communities held hostage to one high, fixed wireline cost, when competition of services are going to continue to evolve in the short term.;N
So I'm curious as how you see that in the near term, and what do you think this looks like 10 or 15 years from now?;N
Do you think individual states are making that challenge hard for wireless solution providers?;N
Do you think we need to do something here in Congress to clarify the other terms and conditions clause that states sometimes interpret in various ways--to use that as a hammer to prevent access in competition?;N
Have some states gone too far in not allowing competition and making it harder for the wireless solution providers?;N
Have they overstepped on what was meant by Congress on terms and conditions, in your opinion?;N
I guess I'm not clear what you--whether you think the problem has been solved or you think you should just continue to give guidance or whether this body needs to have more discussion about this issue.;N
Would you predict, in the next 5 years, that there would be a larger use of the universal service fund for wireless providers?;N
ownership issue, I know people have talked about media consolidation, but I think we're, in the Northwest, one of the areas that was covered by a newspaper that is an independent family owned--I think it's only about 20 percent a newspaper.;N
If you get very large chains of newspapers, for example, their tendency is to--in order to save money, is to use one story that applies to all, or even borrow from other news services.;N
And that's an aspect of media concentration that I don't think we have paid as much attention to as we should have, as well.;N
I think that the Congress is probably supposed to be out either tomorrow or Saturday sometime, and we'll try and get it done before then.;N
Thank you for your willingness to serve, and thank you for being here today, and we look forward to seeing again in the future.;N
I am truly delighted to be here this morning to introduce Annette Sandberg, who is President Bush's nominee to be the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrator.;N
As you well know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is just 3 years old and so it's a relatively new agency within the Department of Transportation, but this agency has an extremely important mission in overseeing our Nation's commercial motor vehicle industry.;N
We know there are many safety issues that need attention, from the commercial driver's license program to the transportation of hazardous materials.;N
She comes with a strong background in law enforcement, including over 17 years with the Washington State Patrol.;D
In fact, in 1995, Annette became the first woman in the country to lead a State police agency when she was appointed chief of the Washington State Patrol, a position that she held for 6 years.;D
Annette holds a law degree from the University of Puget Sound, and a master's in business administration from City University in Bellevue, Washington.;D
In March of 2002, the President appointed her Deputy Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.;D
In December, she was named Acting Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.;D
Under Annette's leadership at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the final rule revising the hours of service in the motor carrier industry was finally released just a few weeks ago.;D
And whether one agrees or disagrees with all parts of the final rule, it is quite impressive that Annette could get the job done while performing in an acting capacity.;D
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to join with my senior Senator in praising the work that Annette Sandberg has done and for nominating her for this position as Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.;D
Many of the Committee members will probably know her or got to know her in her role as the Deputy Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or as the Acting Director of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.;D
But for us in Washington State, as Senator Murray said, we've known this woman, she's had a long and distinguished career.;D
And Senator Murray mentioned that she was the first female chief of the State Patrol, and was the first female chief of any State patrol in the country, and she did so at the wise old age of 33, so she has been blazing a trail for some time.;D
As a State trooper, she earned both her law degree and master's degree, so she accomplished a lot while holding down that responsibility.;D
And in the 6 years as the chief of the patrol, Annette Sandberg's achievement in approving a new canine dog unit to sniff out drug importation into our State, which is very important for us.;D
Being on the Canadian border, we've had a lot of activity, and that program has been a great success, actually more successful than actually having more manpower on the border, having these canine dogs because they do a very efficient job.;D
She made sure that Washington was among the first States to be collecting data on traffic stops and implementing officer training in this area, so again, groundbreaking work.;D
But as Annette has told many people, including her colleagues, she believes that road safety is one of her big passions and she would like to continue that work.;D
So that's why I'm proud here today to recommend her to the Committee with all the highest regards from her work in the State and her most recent work in this position.;D
I know that in this position of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, she will do a tremendous job in serving the country, and I am so excited that she is here before the Committee, and maybe in light of the Committee attendance, I will ask to try to ask a not so hard question, but something that would bring out some of the issues that Annette has gained such expertise and that our country will benefit from.;D
I know you have other responsibilities, but I thank you for taking the time to be here to introduce the witness.;N
The State of New Jersey gets more than its share of truck traffic, even though it doesn't get its fair share in my view of federal dollars, but that's something we will work on at other meetings.;N
I understand and we are pleased to have such a qualified candidate for a position like this, it's an important responsibility.;D
If one sees these 58-foot trucks, and I wrote some legislation years ago to limit the access of triple trailers to our roads in New Jersey, and to keep them from any other State that at that moment didn't have them.;N
Now, I understand that FMCSA is committed to reducing the truck, large truck fatality rate by 41 percent by the year 2008, and I think that's a worthy goal.;N
We know that almost 5,000 people died in accidents involving trucks in 2001, and, including 71 large trucks involved in fatal crashes in New Jersey.;N
Now, there are a number of proposals from the trucking industry and others to increase the size and weight of the trucks on the interstates including lifting the freeze on LCVs, triples, doubles, and Miss Sandberg, I realize that trucks play an important role in our national transportation system.;N
But how do you--and we will be looking to you for advice and perhaps enforcement of the laws that exist now, so that we can make more sense for our propositions to improve safety.;N
Is your agency considering any changes to the freeze on LCVs and would the Agency under your jurisdiction entertain any proposals to change the current LCV freeze?;N
Senator Lautenberg, could I just ask that perhaps Ms. Sandberg could give an opening statement, if that would be okay, and then I will go right back to you for your questions.;N
Welcome, Ms. Sandberg, and then we will go, if you could right after your statement, perhaps respond to Senator Lautenberg's question.;N
Because it appears to be that case, a lot of pressure coming from the trucking industry to get larger trucks out there.;N
And I can tell you that speaking for New Jersey, who has more than, as I mentioned, its fair share of the truck traffic, because we are the north-south direct route, and our highways constantly are up for rehab, repair, and it's a mess.;N
And we've had, as I mentioned to you earlier, a 2-hour wait to cross the George Washington Bridge that goes from New Jersey to New York, but yet the pressure exists.;N
We want to accommodate growth and efficient movement of goods, but then we've got to make changes way ahead of the arrival of those days, and put the appropriate funds into highways.;N
And I know that our New Jersey Turnpike, which is our busiest road, has a separation of cars and trucks for much of its distance, and it's a more comfortable feeling, I've driven on that road, not to have some giant behind you breathing down your back at 80 miles an hour.;N
So I just hope that we're going to be very cautious about making any recommendations to increase weight and size on any road that doesn't clearly have the safety structure to accommodate it.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for bringing up the war issues, because they are important to both of our States and to the country in the sense of security is only as good as the efficiency that goes along with it.;N
Do you think that it's helped, do you think that we need to add more inspectors, what should that process be?;N
And then looking at some of the--I know you talked very specifically, but if you were going to categorize your broad goals as the new Administrator, how would you categorize them?;N
Because you have some challenges, some of the technology from the Customs side that has been implemented and not been as successful as we would like.;N
So as I mentioned, the efficiency of the system obviously impacts the economy of the country as well, certainly impacts the economy of our state as well, but what's the process?;N
I'm concerned because we employed some of these technologies and we found that they worked really well on the southern border, probably related to the conditions and circumstances of the southern border, not so well in the wet and windy Northwest, so some of that technology hasn't been too successful.;N
That decisionmaking process, is that within the Agency or do you involve the larger IT group within DOT? ;N
Ms. Sandberg, we will move your nomination to the floor as quickly as possible, and we want you to be able to get to work with some job security.;N
And we thank you for your willingness to serve the country and we look forward to working with you on issues of great importance to the nation in the future.;N
It is certainly my great pleasure to be here this morning to introduce a fellow Arkansan and a former colleague of mine in our State's congressional delegation, Congressman Asa Hutchinson.;N
President Bush has nominated Asa Hutchinson as Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security in the new Department of Homeland Security.;N
I have had numerous opportunities to work with Mr. Hutchinson on a variety of topics over the last several years, so I have seen firsthand the commitment, the energy, and the foresight that he brings to his career in public service, and I am delighted that he has been selected for this critical position.;D
I trust that the Committee is familiar with Mr. Hutchinson's impressive resume, so I will not take the time here to recount his many accomplishments.;D
"I would, however, like to emphasize the fact that, based upon his past experience as a Federal prosecutor; as also an elected member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Northwest Arkansas; and as an administrator of a Federal law enforcement agency comprising over 10,000 employees, Asa Hutchinson has developed and honed the leadership and executive skills that will make him a valuable asset to this new department.";D
I am very confident that he will bring to this position at the Department of Homeland Security the same commitment, integrity, and vision that he has brought to his service in Congress and the Drug Enforcement Administration.;D
In the aftermath of September 11th, 2001, it has become clear that our Nation's security cannot be taken for granted.;N
Among the newly created Department of Homeland Security's chief objectives will be to reduce our Nation's vulnerability to terrorist attacks and to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States.;N
These objectives will be met, in part, at our Nation's borders and in our Nation's transportation system, both of which present potential vulnerabilities.;N
I am very pleased that the Department of Homeland Security will draw on Asa Hutchinson's expertise in addressing these vulnerabilities and make the United States a safer place for all Americans.;D
As a fellow Arkansan, I am proud of him, and I am happy to support his nomination to this distinguished position.;D
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to come and introduce my fellow colleague from Arkansas.;N
As I mentioned, we are here to welcome a friend, a former colleague in the House, and a man who has served his State and his Nation with distinction.;D
We are very proud that he is willing to serve and that the President of the United States has chosen him for this most important set of responsibilities.;N
I would like to point out that his duties will have jurisdiction over many existing Governmental entities, including the Customs Service, Transportation Security Administration, Federal Protective Service of the General Services Administration, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center of the Department of the Treasury, and the Office for Domestic Preparedness of the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice.;N
Before we proceed further, perhaps, Mr. Hutchinson, you would like to introduce your family members, who are with us today, who we welcome here.;N
I do want to strongly associate myself with your comments and with the firmness and emotion that accompanied them.;N
I also want to welcome Administrator Hutchinson and say that--I will save my questions for when that comes--but that I had not had a chance, Mr. Chairman, to know Asa Hutchinson particularly well until we took a trip together to South America and had a chance then to really discover that maybe we were OK, each of us, as people, and we have been good friends since then.;N
where even our newest members, who we welcome with enthusiasm, and, may I say, far more enthusiasm than the member to your left----;N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for that early bird recognition of being here.;N
It is an honor to serve on this Committee and it is an honor to serve in the historical context of one of the great figures in our State, Warren Magnuson, having been on this Committee for 37 years and chairing it for some time.;N
I do also want to thank Director Hutchinson for his time today and his efforts in Washington State on methamphetamine and a variety of other issues.;N
Obviously, the issue of borders is very important to the northern tier of the country, as well, and I look forward to your comments today about how we continue to upgrade the amount of manpower that we have put on the border.;N
While we have made some progress in the last Congress of actually, I think, tripling the authorization and actually doubling the number of people, the bottom line is it still remains about 9,000 people on the southern border and about 600 on the northern border.;N
So we have had a variety of challenges given that we are a border State next to such a large population center, and the complexity of also obviously having a lot of container traffic going in and out of those ports.;N
So it is no surprise that after the Rasaam case in Washington State, where someone came through and the Customs agents actually caught a terrorist on their way to either blow up LAX or the Space Needle or whatever it was, that we have heightened our interest in making sure that we do not have a porous border there.;N
So I am very interested in your new responsibilities as it relates to implementing a section of the Patriot Act dealing with a biometric standard.;N
We are very interested in seeing a process by which either facial or fingerprint recognition can be a more stable source, working with countries abroad to determine who should get a visa prior to being let into the country, as opposed to the process that we are pursuing today, trying to track people once they are already here, or the large number of deportations that are about to happen.;N
You will be responsible for implementing that part of the Patriot Act, so I look forward to your comments on that.;N
And then, last, just the process that we can work with together on, port security, and the fact that container cargo could be as close as a mile away, to 30,000 fans watching a Mariner or a Seahawk game, and how we implement good border security--container security at our ports, as well.;N
I look forward to your rapid confirmation, hopefully this afternoon, and working with you on those issues in Washington State.;N
I hope that you will immediately start looking at tamper-proof passports, tamper-proof visas, a tracking system so that we know who is in our country and when they either disappear or leave.;N
Certainly, aviation has come a long way since 9/11, but air cargo is still an area that we must address to make sure that everything that goes on an airplane is looked at and we know that it is safe.;N
They are doing a lot on their own, but they cannot do the whole job on their own without Federal help and Federal guidelines.;N
I will ask you some questions, as well, but I know that you have had a huge learning curve.;N
To take over the INS and all of the transportation security in our country is an awesome responsibility.;N
I will say that I think Admiral Loy has done a remarkable job in a very short time with the aviation side, and now he has said he is turning to ports and other modes of transportation, which I think is correct.;N
So I look forward to working with you as the chairman of the Service Transportation Subcommittee, and with the chairman, to make sure that all of our borders and our transportation modes are secure.;N
And thank you, Congressman--and I still refer to you as Congressman--Hutchinson, for agreeing to take this very important and difficult task on.;N
Our appreciation goes out to your family for being willing to tolerate the demands that are going to be placed on your time in the weeks and months ahead.;N
Your two terms in the House, your experience as U.S. Attorney, and, of course, your experience as the Administrator of DEA, provides you with an insight in to the nature of the threat and the need for Federal agencies to work with each other and State and local governments to protect the United States from external and internal threats.;D
I believe you are going to need every bit of that experience, knowledge and leadership, because you are taking on one of the most difficult tasks that I have seen an individual or a new Under Secretary to have to deal with.;D
secretaries, I think yours is the one that is going to be the most important and difficult because of all the different functions and facilities and organizations that you are going to have to try to bring into one that makes sense and works together.;N
I have been, like most senators, trying to keep an eye on how well the Transportation Security Administration has been working.;N
Just yesterday, I took the time to go through the facility at Lexington, Kentucky, to look at what they were doing, and look at the people.;N
I think we have given you a challenge in getting all these different entities to work together.;N
In one instance, at least, the Coast Guard will not be located in your directorate, and I think it is going to be very important that the Coast Guard and the Border Patrol and INS, all of them, are working together in a cooperative way.;N
So I will have a couple of questions, some even a little parochial, although John McCain would certainly not expect that from me----;N
And I, too, think that Asa Hutchinson's going to be an excellent choice for this position.;D
First, with respect to the border, I think Mr. Hutchinson knows that there is a long history of Government officials announcing, with tremendous fanfare, various programs to better enforce the borders, and they always seem to peter out, and I think what I would especially like to hear is how your office, pushing the U.S. Congress, will break that cycle and ensure that this time, the job really does get the followup that is warranted.;D
As someone who has really specialized in technology issues, and has had the chance to serve under Senator Rockefeller on the Intelligence Committee, I think we have got to beef up information sharing, and there is the technology today to do this job right.;N
With the agencies you have got, INS, Border Patrol, and Customs, if one of them sits on information and does not get it out throughout the network, everything is going to fall apart, and clearly, that is something post-9/11 that we are aware of, and you will have a chance to do something about it.;N
I think if there is one thing that we have seen, in terms of trying to hold the key agencies accountable, we have got to have protections for whistleblowers.;N
I think James Loy is off to a very good start, but he has signed some orders recently that do, in my view, affect our ability to get information with respect to mismanagement.;D
I will be asking about those issues, as well, and look forward to your service and supporting you in the confirmation process.;N
I truly enjoyed our visit the other day, and thank you for the courtesy you showed me, and many of my colleagues, I am sure, to come by our offices.;N
I am perhaps repeating much of what has been said, but I think Chairman McCain really hit on one of the issues that the American people feel very keenly, and that is the integrity of our borders.;N
If you listen to talk radio at all, you will know that there is an incessant demand for militarization of our borders, and I am not advocating that, but I notice that, in your record, you actually did vote for that.;N
I would be interested to know if you still think that the United States military has a role to play on our borders.;N
Having said that, as someone who worked with Ron Wyden and others to try to make sense out of our immigration policy with respect to migrant workers, it is a fact that there are a few crops in agriculture, those that are labor intensive, that would simply shut down in the United States if there were not some ability to employ migrant workers.;N
Some of us have worked very hard to find the right compromise to bring some rationality into a visa program that would allow them to work and give them the safety to return, and the integrity of law under which they could live while they are here, and we have been frustrated at every turn.;N
And we, as a country, have a special reason and relationship to keep a special relationship with Mexico and Canada, and I think these are very difficult times, because of terrorism's overlay on everything we are talking about here.;N
Please be mindful that--when it comes to the INS, there are some local sensibilities, too, particularly, in the State of Oregon, where we have had a very unfortunate recent experience with a local director there that, fortunately, has been removed, but--as it relates to racial profiling in a very flagrant and invasive way.;N
I am pleased, Mr. Chairman, to join with you and the other Members of the Commerce Committee in welcoming this very capable individual to take this post.;N
It is an important post that you are taking, and the country is putting a huge reliance upon you.;N
This Committee, as you know, is going to oversee key functions of the DHS, including transportation security.;N
These responsibilities are a vital part of the new department and will present an enormous challenge.;N
As Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, you will have to strike the balance between keeping our borders, roads, rails, and airways safe without unduly hindering the commerce and travel of Americans.;N
And in response to the Chairman's plea, or the Chairman's interest in avoiding the border intrusions that we see, there is no section of our great country that is not subject to intrusions, one way or the other, whether it is desert borders or mountain borders or sea borders, as we have it in my area of the country.;N
I look forward to hearing how, if you are confirmed as Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, you plan to execute the enormous responsibilities of this office, to oversee the protection of the Nation's 300 ports, 7500 miles of border, 95,000 miles of shoreline.;N
And after September 11, we understandably focused on aviation security first and foremost.;N
All Americans who fly now see real changes in the security procedures that beguile us as we go to the airport.;N
In my State, crisscrossed with a network of commuter rail lines and, of course, Amtrak, we must make sure that rail security is a real priority.;N
The Port of New Jersey and New York is the largest port complex on the East Coast of North America, and our port is critical to our region's infrastructure and the economy.;N
And this directorate also has the responsibility, as you well know, for a very important agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for immigration practices and cross-border animal and plant inspections, all the vital components of our homeland security and vital to my home State of New Jersey.;N
But I have observed our candidate's ability, Mr. Chairman, and skill, and I was impressed, I must tell you, and I told this to you personally, even though we were on different sides of the issue, I had the utmost respect for your professionalism and your capacity to take on assignments.;D
And I just wish you the strength and energy to handle this important task for your country.;N
And I look forward to hearing from you about your strategies to undertake this enormous task.;N
I am delighted to be here today to consider the nomination of Asa Hutchinson to this position, one that obviously does represent significant responsibilities.;N
And obviously there is going to be a sense of urgency with all the compelling obligations that you will be assuming in becoming Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security.;N
And I have no doubt that you will provide the kind of leadership that is essential to ensuring our Nation's homeland security.;D
I was reading someplace that your agency will have the most employees within the Homeland Security Department.;N
So with that, you know what you are undertaking in terms of beginning to grapple with the myriad challenges in coordinating and really reconciling a number of agencies that you will have to transcend the historic cultures that have characterized these agencies in the past.;N
As one who has been involved in information sharing since the aftermath of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, I can assure you that information sharing still will become one of the most profound challenges that you will face in your position.;N
In addition, obviously, consultation, coordination, and communication will also be vital ingredients to making your agency work.;N
If you read the report that was issued by the Hart-Rudman Commission last fall, that America is still dangerously unprepared for a terrorist attack on our soil, obviously we have to accelerate timetables that exist in a number of areas.;N
When I look at the gap in--for example, port security, which is still one of the most, I think, significant gaps in our security system in America.;N
When you think about the fact that only 1 to 2 percent of the 6 million containers that come from overseas are inspected, and 95 percent of our trade from outside North America moves to the United States by sea, it is absolutely vital that we focus on this front line of defense.;N
So obviously, we have much more to do, and I would hope that you will be able to work with us, here in this Committee as well as in Congress, to begin to create a comprehensive plan, particularly for high-risk container shipments, so that we can begin to profile those, to alert authorities, to focus their limited inspection and enforcement resources on those that represent the most high-risk containers.;N
In addition, we ought to make sure that radiation detection devices are given to each inspector, as well.;N
So I hope that these security measures can move in a most urgent fashion to begin to really address and fill some of the gaps when it comes to port security.;N
As one who chairs the subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard's responsibilities, I will be holding a hearing to examine their role in fulfilling the mandates under law with respect to homeland security.;N
But, again, I would urge you to work hand-in-glove with the Coast Guard to ensure that everything, in terms of procedures and process, is operational.;N
It is important that we do not wait until dangerous cargo is intercepted when it is in our ports.;N
We obviously have to make sure and prevent that from happening before they get into our ports, and that is where the Coast Guard is going to be playing a primary function.;N
And Senator Hutchison has been working on that and has introduced legislation last week, and I have introduced legislation, as well, in working with her, because we really do have to examine the gaps that currently exist when it comes to air cargo.;N
You know, half of a passenger planes hull consists of air cargo, and yet it remains uninspected.;N
I think we have to begin to take steps in that direction, authenticating those who are shipping this cargo so that we know who the shippers are, so that we have some identity of the air carriers and other entities involved in aviation shipping.;N
I applaud the remarkable willingness that you have shown in addressing these issues that are facing our country today, and I wish you well.;D
It is extraordinary, in the world of intelligence, how good we are at collecting, and how poor we are at analyzing and then disseminating, otherwise called ``sharing.'';N
And we have come to a point in our Nation's life where that is no longer acceptable, and you understand that very well.;N
We created, in the TSA, the Transportation Security Oversight Board, and so the whole question of monitoring of intelligence becomes very much a part of our job and of your job.;N
And incidentally, in terms of our job, as well as the Administration's job, to fund what it is that you have to do.;N
It is good for all of us to talk about what you need to do, but if the Administration does not fund it or we do not fund it, then we become hypocritical in what it is that we say.;N
We have already confirmed Governor Ridge, so I need to assume that you have sat down with him since that point and have discussed a bit the question of intelligence and the question of collecting and, most importantly, of sharing intelligence within these various agencies and within the various agencies which you will oversee.;N
You do not need to answer that, but will you be willing to come to the Intelligence Committee or to this Committee, on an unclassified basis, to discuss these matters?;N
Well, we have five centers now for the collection and analysis, distribution of intelligence, if you include the Under Secretary of Defense.;N
9/11 started through small airports, and those of us who live, as do you, in rural States need to know that there will be a commitment, not just to seeing the magnificent results that we do with the Pittsburghs and other larger arenas, that you are on track and conscious of security for our smaller airports around the country.;N
Our country is not yet familiar with biometrics and what its implications are, both for the security and the identification, and, from that security, leading to greater security through knowledge of who is and is not in this country, and who is and who might not be dangerous.;N
That has to be done instantaneously when we develop a full real-time system of checking people in at airports.;N
It also, of course, is something that would appear, on the surface, to violate people's personal rights, even as they are doing the same thing at ATMs, but they do not make the connection.;N
I am a strong believer in biometrics, and I would hope that you would not only encourage that technology and that use which is still to be even further developed, but that you will then be able to share that with all agencies within your jurisdiction and outside of your jurisdiction.;N
I will come back to that, actually, because it is an important topic, and my office has been involved with that as it relates to the Patriot Act, and I think you are right on target as it relates to getting international cooperation.;N
The point that you were bringing up largely on technology and implementing technology, we have run into a particular problem as it relates to the northern border, in that we have so much territory that the unstaffed areas have been a challenge.;N
Unfortunately, the technology that has been deployed was really much more scaled toward desert terrain.;N
And I think as people have deployed them in the rainy Northwest, in the forest areas, they have found out that they do not work as well.;N
In fact, we have had an investigation reveal that much of the time they are water-logged, that there is not an adequate power supply, that the software does not work, that the cameras are not really tracking the information.;N
So how will you go about evaluating those technology tools and making sure that the demonstration projects really are on track and, if they are not on track, that we look at different ways to supply the resources?;N
We will get you that specific case that has gotten a lot of attention in the Northwest and, obviously, generates a lot of concern of citizens.;N
Can we see a continued advocacy on an increase in northern border staffing, and not a reduction?;N
If the technology we deploy is not as effective or we cannot get effective technology for those porous areas of huge, vast amounts of land, then we need to look at other solutions.;N
And then back to this issue that my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, raised or expounded on.;N
We have had a lot of debate in Washington State, obviously a variety of people of interest to the FBI, but also a lot of concern about the deportation, and I just am interested in this entry-exit system and the special registration of Arab males.;N
But I think if you can work on that oversight you have of a visas--a biometric standard, working with foreign countries, so that you know who people are--because we are going to continue to have millions of people who enter and then overstay.;N
But if we really know who people are and we have cooperation from foreign governments, it is going to make our job easier.;N
Senator Feinstein and I asked for a GAO report to give us the status of air cargo security, and we found that there were a number of holes.;N
As people stand in long lines to get in an airplane and they take off their shoes and everything they can think of that might make the machine go off, we have not looked at the belly of the airplane nearly as carefully.;N
We are now checking most of the checked bags that go in the belly, but cargo is another area.;N
Airlines want to start carrying mail again, and I think it would be important for them to do so, but only when we have a security system in place for mail and air cargo.;N
And do you support legislation that would give the Transportation Security Agency all the tools it needs to decertify an air cargo carrier or handler that does not comply with strict rules of security?;N
And Senator Lott and I have talked about it, and Senator Rockefeller and I worked on it last year.;N
So while our ports have done a great deal on their own, there is no way they could do everything possible or have access to everything they would need to fully secure these very important ports.;N
You mentioned the Coast Guard, and I want to say I do support the Coast Guard being in the Department of Homeland Security, because I think the Coast Guard is now more important than ever before.;N
What are your plans regarding the beefing up of the Coast Guard for its added responsibilities of security?;N
Well, I would hope that you would increase their capabilities, because I think they are going to have a lot more responsibility.;N
The machine-readable visas that have been used for pedestrian traffic on the southern border have been very successful.;N
However, the pedestrian traffic delays have increased because of just the sheer volume of people who are coming over now.;N
Are you going use some of the 150 million INS technological improvements in infrastructure money to look at expediting, not only the pedestrians, but the cars and trucks with these kinds of machine-readable visas where people have proven and have their clearances?;N
And I guess they are all the parts of a couple of dozen agencies, bureaus, parts of departments, and probably a dozen pieces from all over the place.;N
I remember asking several months ago, I guess--maybe 16 months ago or so--our friend, Tom Ridge, ``As we consolidate and develop efficiencies and learn to do a better job spending money more wisely, is it possible we could do this job with fewer people?'';N
I never quite got an answer to that, because I know everybody has been committed to doing the job, which is so important, and we have so far to go that you do not want to get too tripped up in, you know, trying to do it with fewer people or doing it efficiently.;N
But, you know, you are from Arkansas, and I am familiar with your voting record, and I hope that you will see, you know, along the way, if you can do these things with the people you have more efficiently, more effectively, and maybe with less money or fewer people.;N
And also I think one of the things we are going to experience here--in some areas, we are going to go too far too fast, and we are going to have to back away from it a little bit and say, ``Well, maybe we overdid that, or we went too far,'' and we are going to have to reevaluate it.;N
Just one example, you were talking about what Customs has been doing with regard to air cargo imports.;N
I understand that they have now come up with a proposal that would require that detailed manifest information be submitted to Customs at least 8 hours before loading the aircraft for air express packages, and 12 hours for loading--for other air cargo.;N
Clearly, the cargo area is one that we have got to be concerned about, and we have got to ask ourselves, ``How do we deal with it in the commercial passenger aircraft, and in--;N
But in this case, what you would do would be to effectively eliminate overnight express shipments.;N
And so I guess what I am asking you is that--is a commitment that you are going to continue to look at ways to do these things better, more effectively, more efficiently, maybe with, sometimes, different people or better people, fewer people, and also to make sure that we do not go too far sometime without having a hearing.;N
A lot of things we have done, we now need to come back and ask ourselves, ``Are the right people paying for these costs?;N
One area where Members of Congress took an action was the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act, and yet we are not quite sure exactly how that is going to work, or when it is going to work, or who is going to train these pilots.;N
For instance, I have been told that you are thinking that maybe this training would be done internally.;N
And so I hope you will look very carefully at how this program is going to be carried out, implemented, who would train the--I would think you would be much better off contracting with some private sector that has experience in training people for this specific purpose.;N
I hope you will pay close attention to how that is implemented, because I think it could be important.;N
The border is very important, obviously, all over the country, because we do have a flood of illegal immigrants that are risking their lives, and also it can be a place where terrorists can come in.;N
But the one area that still worries me is--I guess, it is maybe because I am more familiar with it, as opposed to the Senators from Texas and Arizona--are the ports.;N
I still know we have got a lot more capability than I thought we would have at this point, and they are doing a pretty good job, but I still think there is a huge risk at ports all around this country.;N
"And while we did provide $93 million for port security grants to airports, I believe, in the fiscal year 2002 budgeting--none of that went to ports between New Orleans and Tampa, for instance there were 22 applicants for grants; none of those, including the No. 1 of the 22, were approved.";N
I know the bigger ports, obviously, have the greater risk--New York, Baltimore, and ports in Texas and California and so forth--but we also have huge risk at some of these smaller ports, and I hope that you will look at making sure the ones that are particularly potentially dangerous do get some assistance, and some attention is paid to allocation of those funds in terms of need and geographical distribution.;N
Several of my colleagues talked about the question of sharing information among the various agencies that are in your jurisdiction.;N
And my question to you at this point is, How would you see breaking the mindset among these various agencies that tend to keep information to themselves.;N
I think it is clear you are right with respect to computers and making sure that they are in place to share information, but I am concerned that unless you break this mindset, it will eventually lapse into something resembling business as usual.;N
I mean, let us say the Coast Guard spots some suspicious material, something that could be an ingredient for a chemical or a biological attack.;N
Related ingredients show up at a Customs department office, say, on the northern border, which we have been concerned about.;N
And then, at the same time, immigration authorities or the FBI have their eye on a suspicious set of individuals.;N
Here you have got three agencies, where, historically, they would be inclined to work in isolation.;N
On the whistleblower issue that I mentioned earlier, I would like to hear your thoughts and have you use this opportunity to send a signal to the workers that it is safe to come forward.;N
I think there is great concern with respect to the workers right now, and certainly the TSA order recently, the Transportation Security order, has raised additional questions with respect to employees' rights.;N
And again, just, let us take a hypothetical, and let us say the recordkeeping and data-entry systems are so poor that key information that is important to fighting terrorists gets lost, and somebody wants to come forward.;N
I am convinced that a lot of people are very fearful about coming forward in this climate, and I would like to have you use this opportunity to state how you feel and send a message that you want that information.;N
On this whistleblower issue, having worked with a lot of them in various areas, including intelligence and healthcare and the like, I would just tell you, the first couple of cases are going to be absolutely key, because yours is a brand-new department with a huge number of employees.;N
If you handle the first couple of whistleblower cases in a way that shows that you have confidence in the employees, that is going to be everything.;N
If they look at those first couple of cases and say, ``We are going to get bounced if we come forward,'' I think it is going to be very, very damaging.;N
There has been a lot of discussion of technology throughout the different lines of questioning today.;N
It came up, of course, with biometrics, with some of the questions about visas that Senator Hutchison was asking, border patrols, and some of the checked-baggage screening, as well.;N
It seems that it is going to be critical to the success of the new agency, and in your work in particular.;N
Are there any other areas of technology that you think are particularly important, or will be going forward, or are technologies that you would want to highlight to this Committee in our efforts, moving forward, to try to help you do your job more effectively?;N
Is the same individual who is going to have responsibility for data base management and information systems going to also have responsibility for ensuring that new equipment to screen all checked baggage is put in place at the airports?;N
How do you separate those different types of technology, and is there someone in the new agency that will have overall responsibility?;N
And you mentioned that position before, the research directorate, and I think that is important.;N
But I think, in some ways, the bigger challenge and the more immediate challenge is going to be to take existing technologies that really have never been used in this kind of a domestic capacity before--the Chairman mentioned the use of drones on the border, for example--and there will really need to be someone that has an expertise in the area of applying technology to solve real-world problems that is assisting the agency, I think.;N
I do not know that it is the same position as someone running a research lab, and it is--I do not believe it is the same position as someone who typically manages an information technology system or a data base system.;N
Those are very important roles, but I think that is going to be one of the challenges, is not looking out 20 years to new technologies, but let us just take some available technologies and use them better today.;N
Obviously, port security is one of the major concerns expressed by many Members of this Committee.;N
And referring back to the Hart-Rudman report, it indicated that the port vulnerability studies for the Nation's 50 largest ports are not expected or scheduled to be completed for five more years.;N
It would seem to me, given the imperative of this issue and the impact that it could have, not only, you know, economically here in the United States, but worldwide--I mean, as the report indicated, if there was just one explosive device detected in any one container that came into our ports, it basically would bring the whole shipping industry to its knees, not to mention the effects it would have worldwide with 21,000 containers coming into our ports each and every day.;N
It would seem to me that we would want to accelerate the timetable for these vulnerability assessments.;N
With--43 percent goes into Long Beach and Los Angeles alone, in terms of our cargo shipments--it would seem to me that we would make this the highest priority, to evaluate these assessments and to move quickly to address the gaps in the system.;N
Well, this report went on to say that very small amounts have been given so far, with respect to this issue, in grants.;N
I mean, even for--Los Angeles and Long Beach, which receives 43 percent of the shipments, in the year 2001 received a grant of $6.1 million.;N
But I think we would want to be apprised if we are not giving sufficient amount of money to make sure that port security is being pursued aggressively in what we need to do in order to close these vulnerability gaps.;N
Another recommendation in this report is on--in talking about--and certainly my border, in Maine, with Canada, and one of the longest, if not the longest, with Canada--we have many remote locations.;N
Because obviously, that is important to the local residents, to be able to have use of those areas, but at the same time, we want to make sure that they are secure.;N
I know that the U.S. and Canada signed last month the U.S./Canada Smart Border Declaration, and I think that is moving, certainly, in the right direction.;N
I hope we can accelerate that timetable, as well--but also to be used as a standard, international standard, for other international organizations.;N
Overall, in terms of the magnitude of your responsibilities--they certainly could not be greater when you are thinking of what you are enjoining, in terms of the agencies and their jurisdictions--are certainly varied.;N
I would hope that you would make sure to conduct an audit of all the things that really need to be done sooner rather than later and share that with the Committee so that we can help you to meet your responsibilities under the law, and to help you organizationally, as well.;N
You know, I know that there is no question that your paramount challenge is the organization issue, and making sure that the bureaucracy functions in a way that does not allow lapses that obviously violate our security in this country.;N
And as far as the Coast Guard is concerned, again I certainly--I know that you will have a good working relationship with the Coast Guard, working hand-in-glove, as I said earlier, but also to ensure that there are not any operational or jurisdictional disputes that they can--because obviously the Coast Guard is going to play a premier role in ensuring our homeland security.;N
If I might just say, Mr. Hutchinson, the watch list is available to the Immigration Service.;N
So presumably, someone trying to cross the border from Canada into the U.S. would be able to get through the Immigration Service by avoiding them, going ten miles west or east on some country road.;N
And then ten miles south of that border at Pembina, North Dakota, although the immigration service had the information ten miles north of the border, ten miles south, the highway patrol or the county sheriff will not have access to that information.;N
You are quite correct, the NCIC has been improved, but it does not, at this point, consist of the names of terrorists or known terrorists who are on the watch list.;N
That watch list is not perfect, you are correct about that, as well, but it is the only comprehensive list that we have made that describes terrorists who we know are terrorists, those who we suspect are terrorists.;N
And again, the top recommendation, the top priority, of the Rudman-Hart report was to correct this and to correct it quickly.;N
And I have been raising this issue for some months, and regrettably, I see very little progress.;N
And I am heartened by your selection, because I think you are someone who can get something done, and that is why I wanted to come and make this point.;D
Every law-enforcement official across this country deserves to know if they have got someone in the car in front of them that they have just stopped who is a known terrorist and on a list that this country has.;N
It desperately short-changes them and risks their lives, and promotes great risk for this country by not putting in the hands of 650,000 law-enforcement people that information.;N
I am sorry I was delayed today, and I hope the Chairman recognizes that I had to be on the floor of the Senate.;N
"We lost Senator Pryor to the Armed Services Committee, where he was sitting in a very similar position; and, therefore, we were unable to retain him.";N
He is somebody that we're very, very proud of in Michigan, as CEO and president of the Kellogg Company.;N
"It's on a very strong financial footing, for many reasons; particularly, the community that it is centralized and localized in, but also because of his leadership.";N
His experience in running various parts of the Kellogg Company across this globe will help him to be a tremendous Secretary of Commerce.;D
He came to the United States when he was 7 years old, and his first job with Kellogg's was delivering cereal from a van, stocking the shelves, I believe, in Mexico, and working himself up from there so that, during his career with Kellogg's, he has managed several international divisions, including general manager of Kellogg of Mexico, president and CEO of Kellogg Canada, president of Kellogg Asia Pacific.;N
And this vast business experience in the United States and abroad has given him a unique understanding of our country's role and the challenges that we face in the global marketplace.;D
And he also, in addition to coming from mid-America, the Heartland of America, in a mid-sized town, Battle Creek, he understands the values of mid-America and the value of hard work.;D
He also understands some of the challenges that we face in the manufacturing sectors of America, because--Kellogg being, of course, a major manufacturer.;D
And I do also want to clarify--when Senator Levin talks about ``cornflakes,'' it is ``Kellogg Corn Flakes'' that we are speaking about here.;N
But I am very pleased to be here to support the nomination and present to you a fellow Michiganian as our next Secretary of Commerce.;N
As you have heard on many occasions, his impressive background reveals a shining example of an individual who came to America, to our nation of immigrants, and enjoyed a very real opportunity to pursue the American Dream, which he continues to pursue today.;D
I wish to join my Chairman in welcoming you, Mr. Gutierrez, to your first appearance before this Committee.;N
You may not be aware of this, but it's through sheer determination that we're meeting today.;N
As he noted in his opening statement, he said that it is critical that the Department play an active role in linking businesses with market opportunities throughout the world, supporting our companies where needed, and, I think, ensuring that the Department's role in our embassies is expanded.;N
And I look forward to working with you on these and many other important matters within the Department's jurisdiction.;N
As you've noted, Mr. Gutierrez, in the past 2 weeks we've seen photos after photos of devastation, death, and misery throughout the Indian Ocean area.;N
And living in an island state in the midst of volcanic activity, such as Hawaii, the people of Hawaii are very well aware of the destructive power of tsunamis.;N
And the Chairman, who is from Alaska, is also familiar with the threats posed by earthquakes and tsunamis to our coastal communities.;N
And that's why we have worked together very closely, throughout the many years, to increase our support for the funding of NOAA's tsunami warning program, including warning sensors in Hawaii and Alaska.;N
And, as you are well aware, 85 percent of all the tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean area, and we spend about $10 million annually for the Pacific system.;N
And I'm assured that the expansion will be completed, not next year, but in the next 7 years, and I think that is not acceptable, with what is happening out there.;N
assure that our Department has adequate resources to address this matter and fulfil your many other important responsibilities.;N
And in lieu of making an opening statement, I would just like to submit my prepared statement for the record.;N
One is about broadband, specifically about broadband, getting broadband out into rural America.;N
And I'd just like to get your thoughts on any plans or proposals or ideas you have to try to get broadband out into rural America.;N
And the second question I have, again, relates to one of the President's policies--and one of your predecessor, Don Evans, policies--about the steel industry.;N
In December of 2003, President Bush made the determination to extend that program--along with Secretary Evans.;N
But, as I understand it, as of today, the Commerce Department has not adopted regulations to extend the program.;N
And that's an important industry to a lot of different states in the United States, but I think it's an important industry to the American economy.;N
Based on the fact that we will be confirmed by the time we vote on this nomination on the floor, and we will vote off the floor on reporting the nominee, I want to put in the record now a motion that the Secretary--that the nomination be recommended to the floor for confirmation.;N
I have a whole series of written questions, which I wish to submit, as well as the ones that I'll ask today.;N
And, you know, people who have not been sworn in as Committee Members, or whatever, the--approved by the Senate as Committee Members--can't vote.;N
I suppose that'll happen tomorrow, but I doubt that I'll get the answers to my questions tomorrow, and I've never been through a hearing, that I can remember, where I've voted in favor of somebody who hasn't responded to written questions.;N
And so, my approach would be that I would have to vote no in Committee, if you're going to do that today, and then hopefully wait until the Secretary-designate answered the questions.;N
And it's my understanding that we'll not be here after Friday, and the first time we'll be back will be January 20th.;N
I hope you get your questions by that time, because we'll vote after the first vote on the floor.;N
I want to re-emphasize what I told you in private--is that, before this job is over for you, you will know more about fish than cornflakes.;N
As you're aware, I think, from our conversation, the largest trade case in American history is between the United States and Canada on the soft wood lumber issue.;N
I'm hoping that you will tell me that those duties will not be surrendered until they are part of a negotiated settlement.;N
It's very important, and it's in the interest of Canada and the United States that we negotiate a settlement so that this industry, on both sides of the border, can survive.;N
And these duties that are being collected are an important--a very important part of that negotiated settlement.;N
On the issue of piracy, Mr. Gutierrez, America's copyright industry generates some 12 percent of American GDP, and account for over 8 percent of the total U.S. employment.;N
Specifically, the four copyright categories are movies, music, publishing, and software--computer software.;N
They account for over $90 billion in foreign sales and exports--more than agriculture, more than automobiles, and more than aircraft.;N
And there are just untold numbers of people whose jobs are in jeopardy because of the amount of theft that is occurring overseas on American copyrighted materials.;N
And so, I don't know if you have a comment on that, but I raise this issue, because I think it's so important to highlight to the Department of Commerce that we vigorously pursue piracy issues, specifically with China, specifically with Russia, where we have lost billions.;N
Pretty soon our entertainers are going to be on street corners with monkey-grinders, trying to get people to pay them.;N
But, ultimately, if we lose copyright issues, we're going to lose a great and valuable part of the American economy.;N
Gutierrez, I understand that China is on the verge of releasing government procurement regulations for China that will have the effect of barring most U.S. soft-wood products from being sold in China.;N
You're here at a historic moment, not only for you, but for this Committee, as well, because it is a--I don't want to use the term ``reformed''--restructured Committee.;N
And I welcome our new colleagues, not as joyously as I might have had if they were sitting on this side of the aisle----;N
And, Mr. Gutierrez, I would think that you'd have to note that Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and I are among the more mature Members here, and we, the three of us, served in World War II.;N
We are, I think, the last ones to have been active during the period in the--in this Senate.;N
In many instances through this body, we've met people who similarly--I was born of immigrant parents, and had a fortunate and somewhat lucky business career before coming here, so I respect greatly what you've accomplished, from the--;N
And we're going to look to you, Mr. Gutierrez, for a response that I noted in your comments, and that was that you hoped to bridge the boundaries, and you included, in there, political, economic, et cetera.;N
We sometimes have disagreements that ought to be able to be dealt with in a more comprehensive fashion, and I hope that you'll help us.;N
This department, this Committee, has an enormous array of items that we work with, and you'll have a chance to hear about them and learn about them, and going from the communications side to the marine side to the trade and business side.;N
And when I look at where we are, Mr. Gutierrez, I don't understand what it is that has us with a dollar that's so cheap compared to other currencies.;N
What has to happen with our products that are sold at these very relatively low prices and still don't enable us to gain a favorable trade balance?;N
So those are among the things that--and, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that my full statement be included in the record.;N
And I would just ask this one question of Mr. Gutierrez, and that is, If the dollar continues to fall, would it be your view that it's either good or bad for the economy?;N
Senator, I have a lot to learn about Washington and about how our business is conducted here.;N
One thing I have learned is that the only two people who speak on behalf of the currency, or about the currency, are the Secretary of the Treasury and the President.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, and thank you for the warm welcome to the Committee.;N
"One of the problems has been that, within our own bureaucracy, the rate of properly imposing those is under 20 percent; whereas, the overall rate, in terms of proper tariff enforcement by our own people--I'm talking about our government--is over 95 percent.";N
And we've been pushing and pushing and pushing Customs and others to get our act together to fix that.;N
There have been recent decisions that have confirmed that there's dumping--illegal dumping of foreign shrimp, and we're moving to respond to that.;N
But, again, some of this process takes so long that if you're a small business, which every Louisiana shrimper is, it doesn't matter if it happens 5 years from now.;N
I'd also like to touch on NOAA, which is very important to my part of the world, in the Gulf of Mexico.;N
I'm a strong supporter of NOAA, and it does a lot of important things, including pure science and research, but it also does some very applied things, which are important, like survey work in Alaska, in the Gulf of Mexico, elsewhere.;N
"I'm a big supporter of making sure we get that survey work done, because it's not several steps removed from commerce; it is directly related to commerce, certainly in the Gulf.";N
And I'd just like your reaction to that, and your thoughts on that end of, sort of, the NOAA spectrum of work.;N
science end is often the, sort of, ``sexy'' end that gets attention and money, and the applied end sometimes gets short shrift.;N
And things like routine updating of surveys of the Gulf and the waters off Alaska and elsewhere is very important for maritime commerce.;N
Also, I'm a strong supporter of getting the most bang for the buck for that sort of work, however the chips may fall, whether it's a government-owned vessel or whether it's contracting out to private firms.;N
And I would encourage you to use no test, other than what is going to get the taxpayer the most bang for the buck.;N
In survey work, it's pretty simple, in terms of, you know, How much surveying are you going to be able to do for X amount of dollars?;N
And that also translates, ultimately, into how much political support we have for trade, because if we don't have reasonable enforcement in a reasonable amount of time, and small business is hurt every step of the way, obviously----;N
As you know, my predecessor, Senator Hollings, from South Carolina, served many years, and I don't know if I can serve as many, but I look forward to serving with all of you.;N
As I understand the protocol from your opening statement, you have to still approve me as a--or confirm me as a Member before we confirm you as Chairman before we confirm Mr. Gutierrez----;N
And I liked a lot of the things you said, particularly about fostering a better business environment in this country.;N
As I visit businesses all over the country, particularly in South Carolina, I hear more and more about the burden of costs and regulation and taxes and liability that comes from being a U.S.-based manufacturer, particularly.;N
And as a producer, yourself, for many years, doing business internationally, I'd just like to hear you talk a little bit about how we can make American business more competitive, and cut the costs of doing business in this country, and make this the best place in the world to do business.;N
And I'm sure, in your role at Kellogg, many times you've said, ``If I was in Washington, this is what I would do, this is what I would change.'';N
And I'd just love to hear you just talk a few minutes, generally, about what you think we need to focus on here in the Senate, in the Congress, the President, and what you would do, in the Department of Commerce, to make America the best place in the world to do business.;N
And if I could just echo some of the things we've heard, as far as trade, I'm from a textile-producing state.;N
But the political support and just the pragmatism of trade really only exists if we're going to enforce our agreements, if we're going to protect our copyrights and our patents.;N
And I think if there's one thing we need from the Commerce Department more than anything else, is a level, balanced playing field around the world, and just good enforcement, so we can do business everywhere in the world with--and on a fair basis.;N
Have you determined whether you would recuse yourself on sugar issues if, in fact, you had a decisionmaking authority there?;N
On another issue, then--Senator Ashcroft and I passed a piece of legislation, that has become law, that allows, for the first time in 40-some years, us to sell agricultural products into the Cuban marketplace for cash.;N
The Department of the Treasury is now taking an exceptional and unusual interpretation of the language of the law, and trying to do everything they can to impede and stop the legitimate sale, under current law, of agricultural commodities to Cuba.;N
You talked about wanting to reduce the barriers and burdens of our ability to sell overseas.;N
There are proposals by the USTR, that we would be willing to negotiate away our anti-dumping provisions.;N
We don't have the backbone or the will or the steel to employ them hardly at all, ever, but negotiating them away is fundamentally folly, in my judgment, for this country.;N
I did receive a call from Mr. Canales, who, I believe, would be my counterpart in Mexico if I am confirmed and sworn in.;N
But I can assure you I did not make any commitments on behalf of the Administration or the U.S. Government, knowing that I have not been confirmed as Secretary of Commerce.;N
I mean, that is--that's very, very--it's a marvelous thing, an emotional, marvelous tribute to, obviously, a strong man.;N
I don't mean to hold anything up, and it would--I will probably end up voting for you, but I do want to get the answers to some questions that I will submit to you, and they're--and they won't be, I don't think, particularly difficult.;N
And steel--there's a big question there--and steel, to some people, is, kind of, a subject which has passed us by.;N
I remember talking with a former--member of a former Administration, a Democratic Administration, and I talked about the fact that free-trade--I mean, you made mention that you've got to have good trade-remedy laws, in an answer to Senator Dorgan.;N
And somehow, free trade and free-trade remedies and the holding on to--not weakening the laws at Doha, et cetera, which our current USTR Ambassador promised me, and then, within 3 months, was giving them away, negotiating them away--that's very, very serious in West Virginia, where our unemployment is very high, and where only 4 percent of the land is flat, and where life is constantly hard.;N
There are many rural states here, and that's why you're hearing about individual problems.;N
There are very few, sort of, states that have all kinds of opportunities, economic opportunities.;N
The Doha package is very important to me, and I want to know--although--that you will do everything in your power, as Secretary of Commerce, which I think you will become, to not negotiate any further trade-remedy laws away.;N
It's not a high-tech, in the usual sense--you know, the Silicon Valley sense--but, oh, there are so many people that work for it for generations, and then they come out, and their retirement is gone, their pension is gone, their health benefits, gone, everything is gone.;N
And when that was--when some of these changes were made, in 2002, the Congress passed a TAA, which--a reform act, which said that up to 65 percent of the cost of health insurance would be borne and available to the employees.;N
Now, what's interesting is that only 6 percent of the employees that this affects have taken advantage of that, which is shocking, in a sense, but it means that the 65 percent doesn't do the job.;N
And the thinking, generally around here is, it's got to be 95 percent if it's going to do the job.;N
But the 6 percent thing, I wish you would look into why--why is it so little, when healthcare costs--these, of course, are much older people, people who have been injured, et cetera, and I would like to hear, at some point, your thoughts on that question.;N
Also--and my time is about up--when the President put in the existing Steel Import Monitoring Program, there was a--that was also, at the same time, a Section 201 pass, which was temporary relief for steel.;N
And, at that time, Secretary Evans, your predecessor, stated, unequivocally, that the existing program would be expanded to additional steel products, and made indefinite in duration.;N
And I would hope that you would commit yourself, to the extent that you can, that this program would continue.;N
And I welcome our new Members to the Committee, and thank Mr. Gutierrez for being here, and, moreover, thank him for the service that he will be performing for our country.;N
So thank you and your family for your patriotism and your service and leadership and insights you'll be providing to us and, obviously, the President and, ultimately, benefiting the American people.;D
I'm one, Mr. Gutierrez, that believes that we need to do everything we can to make sure that this country is more competitive, more desirable for investment and job creation.;N
That means our tax policies, regulatory policies, research, education--all need to make sure that every American has a better ability to compete and succeed internationally.;N
And so, many of the issues that have been brought up here by some of my colleagues are important in that regard.;N
Trade agreements are important, but they need to be enforced, So I'm glad to hear your comments.;N
It'll be important that you work with our trade representatives to enforce when China is cheating in a variety of areas, whether it's intellectual property, whether that's software or other matters, furniture, textiles, or semiconductor chips.;N
If we're going to have trade agreements, those contracts need to be enforced, and enforced quickly.;N
This will be necessary if we're going to continue to try to have the support of the American people for trade agreements as a net-plus.;N
Trade adjustment assistance is important, understanding that there are some folks that are hurt by international treaties, trade agreements.;N
And I'm one who's been advocating making sure that folks don't lose their homes, have a transition for mortgages for 12 months so they don't lose their homes as they're retraining and finding another job.;N
One thing we've done on the Foreign Relations Committee, to Senator Smith's comments on intellectual property and piracy, is provided $5 million to help train and enforce copyright or intellectual property rights, and make sure those countries are enforcing them, because it's pretty hard for us to do it in another country if they don't care about it there.;N
And one issue we're going to bring up here is the whole Telecommunications Act and getting that thing up to date so that broadband will be available.;N
It is the way that small businesses in small towns and rural areas can communicate, conduct business, get education and information.;N
Your predecessor was helpful in my efforts to make sure that the Internet was not taxed with access taxes--on average of about 18 percent, if the state and local commissars have their way.;N
Can you give us assurance that you'll continue to be in favor of keeping the Internet free of Internet access taxes, no matter which platform one receives broadband, whether it's by DSL, satellite, over power lines, or wireless?;N
Good, because I think the people who would be hurt the most by taxes on broadband would be, clearly, those of lower income, as well as smaller jurisdictions.;N
One other measure--that I've worked on--and this Committee has passed, for the knowledge of some of the new Members--is a measure to upgrade the technology capabilities at minority-;N
serving institutions, higher education--whether they're historically black colleges and universities, tribal universities, or Hispanic-serving institutions--to upgrade their technology so those students have the faculty, the training, the education to get the good jobs, 60 percent of which require technological proficiency.;N
"We got it through the Senate; we've got to get it through the House and get the Administration onboard.";N
But could you share with me any experiences that you've had as a leader of the Kellogg Company, insofar as working with minority-serving institutions?;D
Is your wonderful bride, Edilia, and your children going to be moving with you, if you are so-confirmed?;N
I want to welcome you, Mr. Gutierrez, and am looking forward to working with you in the future.;N
Certainly, the Commerce Department has a number of issues that are vital, not only to my own constituency in Maine, but throughout this country.;N
And, certainly, that is--been one of my major areas of concern for some time, since I've been in both the House and Senate, particularly from the standpoint that our government has failed to aggressively enforce our trade laws.;N
And you're in a prime position, given your very impressive personal history and your entrepreneurial abilities, and being a skilled leader and corporate executive, in how to create jobs and to build a business, and I think that entrepreneurial spirit will be absolutely vital at a time when we're confronting monumental change in our own economy.;D
As others have mentioned here, you know, we have had, obviously, huge disparities with respect to trade, unfair trade subsidies.;N
"Whereas, you probably know, there are more than 2.7 million jobs that have been lost in the manufacturing segment of our economy; and, in Maine over the last 4 years, 17,600 jobs.";N
And I would encourage you to review the--Congress created a commission, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, and it recently issued a report.;N
And it was--that examination indicated, very specifically and explicitly, that the U.S. was failing to vigilantly protect intellectual property rights.;N
And it also said that we were not properly addressing China's illegal trade subsidies, and, of course, the unfair manipulation of its currency, the yuan.;N
But it's all, I think, intertwined to the problems that we're facing that has undermined our manufacturing sector unfairly.;N
So, I would hope you would use your leadership and your abilities and your knowledge to fight these issues and to challenge our trading partners, where they are trading illegally, unfairly, and also holding our WTO members accountable to the commitments that they're required to make.;D
And, certainly, that has been the case with China in the past, and that's why we've got this enormous record-high trade deficit.;N
It all goes back to the domestic manufacturing sector that has paid a very steep price for this unfairness.;N
You know, the President created, for the first time ever, a manufacturing czar, an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, and that was recently filled as a position, and I would hope that you would work with the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Frink, to work on these issues, to open up markets, to help, as others have indicated here, to reduce the structural costs to manufacturers so that they can remain competitive and to keep that competitive edge.;N
So, I would hope that you would use the auspices of this position to do all that you can to enforce these agreements.;N
And I also would certainly point out that one program within the Commerce Department is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program--;N
it's now the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership--and that program is vital to manufacturers.;N
And I was very concerned that that program was cut--in fact, from, like, 106 million in 2004, to 39 million.;N
It's sort of counterintuitive, at a time in which we're creating a new position for Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, we were cutting the program that provides the very tools and expertise to manufacturers in our country.;N
We now have restored it to its proper funding level, but I understand the Administration's budget might contain another severe cut, and I think that's the wrong direction, the wrong message at a time in which our manufacturers have been hurting as a result of all the issues that I have raised.;N
Another area--because I know my time will be expiring, so can I shift from land to sea--I have chaired the Ocean, Fisheries, and Coast Guard Subcommittee.;N
And I would commend you, as well, to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the 212 recommendations that they have made.;N
And to use your leadership to begin to work with the Committee and the Congress to systematically implement those recommendations, where we can, to find the funding on those critical issues, because it is evermore important.;D
In fact, I do believe that we should create a national global warning system, ocean observing and warning system.;N
And I have established one in the State of Maine, and I have recommended, and the Commission has recommended, creating a national system.;N
I know there's a Pacific warning system, and I've had concerns about NOAA, and I have expressed that recently, after the devastating tsunami, where they did not contact officials in other countries.;N
They did contact Australia, and Australia contacted Indonesia when there were signs of this impending tsunami in the Indian Ocean.;N
I realize it's a Pacific warning system, but I think we have to work through those issues to see how we can set up an observation system that will work.;N
And this global warning system can work in that regard, not only for monitoring the sea, but also to provide these indications.;N
And I'm delighted to be here this afternoon, with you presiding for the first time over this Committee.;N
I want to say how proud I am to have the new Members, and I've already been visiting, on both sides of the aisle, and I've been assured that the gentleman from Arkansas is going to be voting with me more over the next 2 years than he did the previous years.;N
And we congratulate you on your nomination, and we extend to your family, sitting behind you, our thanks for their willingness to sacrifice so that you can do this job.;N
And with your predecessor, every time I got a letter from him, or sent one, there was always a fish drawn at the bottom of the letter.;N
But the problem is, at Commerce, you've got so many things you're going to be dealing with, important issues, that sometimes fisheries sort of fall off the end of the table.;N
I was afraid we wouldn't hear any more about Gulf shrimp, but--with John Breaux gone--but I'm reassured that I've got an ally here, and am making the point to you that fisheries are in the Gulf, not just in the Northeast and the Northwest.;N
I also join my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and particularly the new Senator from South Carolina, on the trade issue.;N
Like most of them, I have voted consistently for all the trade agreements--GATT, NAFTA, China agreement, all of them--;N
but I do think that we've got to also use common sense, and we've got to make sure that they are--our trading partners are fair in their treatment and dealings with us.;N
One point, though, that I don't believe has been raised, and that's with regard to the new partnership called the U.S. A-Team.;N
This is directed at improving competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry, and it--but it only includes--it includes just--;N
basically, Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler, but not other foreign companies that have significant domestic activity.;N
And that could--you know, that includes, obviously, Nissan and Honda and Toyota and--well, Mercedes is DaimlerChrysler.;N
I'd like you to take a look at this and make sure that we are approaching this right, that we don't penalize companies that are creating jobs and doing significant business in this country.;N
To include one foreign company, but not others that are doing this domestic work, I believe is a mistake, and I hope that you will look at that.;N
I look forward to voting for your nomination and confirmation, and to working with you in the next 4 years.;N
We've talked, already, about a number of issues, when you and I had the opportunity to sit down.;N
"Because since we had our personal visit, and I told you about the fact that Brazil, if it were to have the tariff eliminated on Florida citrus, would not become free trade; it would become monopoly trade.";N
But since then, in late December, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Brazilians are still up to no good.;N
They are dumping, on the market, both frozen concentrate, at 37 percent less than production costs, and selling pasteurized not-from-concentrate juice at 78 percent lower than production costs.;N
The Commerce Department is going to weigh in on these kinds of things, and I just want to underscore to you what we had talked about before.;N
And, as a matter of fact, I was flying off the southern coast of Cuba, as we had surrounded Hurricane Charley, as it was moving to the northwest, dropping those instruments that gave realtime data that, then, we collected on the airplane and beamed it by satellite back to the National Hurricane Center, and has given us the opportunity for very accurate forecasting.;N
I think Senator Snowe mentioned that it was actually the NOAA Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii that picked up the earthquake off Indonesia, but they didn't have the buoys out there to know where the tsunami was going.;N
And then, in your Department, you have the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that oversees Federal Government spectrum usage of the electromagnetic spectrum.;N
We simply need to relieve some of the spectrum that now, with digital, can be combined and--do what with it?;N
We have battled here on this Committee, because there are powerful entities that we are battling.;N
And yet, for the good of the country, we're going to have to do that, and we're going to have to accommodate all these people in the telecommunications industry.;N
Eventually, we're going to have to address the intellectual property issue with regard to other countries, particularly China.;N
That means a great deal to our country and to its ability to compete in the world, and that's going to be in your sphere of influence, as well.;N
I enjoyed our brief conversation the other evening, and I look forward to working with you.;N
Nebraska's economy, as is the case with many economies in the Midwest, is driven by agricultural and non-agricultural trade, especially as it pertains to exports to other parts of the world.;N
"I doubt that you expected to talk as much about trade today as, perhaps, you have, given the fact that Ambassador Zoellick gets an earful, as well, about the challenges we have with trade, the growing deficit that we have in so many parts of the world, particularly with the People's Republic of China; the weak dollar and how that is supposed to work to our benefit, but it gets pegged by other currency and, therefore, there is no major advantage; the European barriers, which I suspect you may know first hand, coming from the food-";N
processing and packaging and distribution industry, as it relates to the genetically modified organisms and all the other ways that the Europeans seem to have not to import our agricultural products.;N
And you probably have received an earful about the importance of free trade combined with fair trade, so that we do have the ability to throw a flag when there's a--;N
where there's an infraction, to try to get something resolved as quickly as we possibly can.;N
Having set that up as a background, without setting you up, do you have any particular thoughts about what you might do to work with Ambassador Zoellick, within the Administration, and with this Committee and others, to try to resolve some of the major disputes, such as with the European trading partners, perhaps with Canada and some of the areas that we challenge there.;N
One big idea or something that might be able to give us some idea of what you have in mind.;N
As it relates to the currency, I suspect that Secretary Snow has some interest in that, and you'll have the opportunity to work with him.;N
But we were all told that a weak dollar would be good for exports from America, because the high value of the other currency should be able to buy more.;N
As it relates to balance of trade, as you look to the future, because of the importance of exports from America, particularly as it relates to manufactured goods, do you have any thoughts about steel prices?;N
But the challenge that we have right now with the steel prices in the U.S. versus steel prices elsewhere, and the outsourcing and the offshoring of jobs----;N
Mr. Chairman, before proceeding with my questions, I'd like to, most respectfully, suggest to the Secretary-designee that when Chairman Stevens invites you to Alaska, there's only one answer:----;N
Could I inquire of the Senator from Hawaii, maybe a trip with the Secretary to your state would be in order.;N
And we would ask that you respond, to the questions that have been submitted to you, by Friday, if it's possible, Mr. Secretary.;N
Mr. Gutierrez, I've had the high privilege and the great honor of serving in the Congress for--since 1949--1959, I'm sorry--and in the Senate for 42 years.;N
And in that period, I've had the opportunity to work with Cabinet Secretaries, appointees of several Presidents.;N
And all of them would have resumes speaking highly of their academic accomplishments, doctorate from Harvard, or a Ph.D. from some other place, Oxford and all of this.;N
And all the appointees that I've sat through on their hearings of this nature, you're the only appointee that I know of who has no college degree.;N
What makes your background such that you believe would well serve the country as Secretary of Commerce?;N
And I know that it's quite un-senatorial to announce your decision before decision-time, but I'm prepared to cast my vote in your favor at this moment.;N
I want to tell you that I served as an assistant to a Cabinet Officer, Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton, who had no college degree.;N
So I feel sorry for your assistants, because I think you know how to work, and you'll work the people around you as they should work.;N
At the direction and instructions of the Chair, I want to welcome all the nominees with us today and especially the families.;N
You have a lot to be proud of, and I know that this is a very important day for all of you.;N
And so I will place my statement on each nominee in the record, because I think we would like to expedite the hearings.;N
I have come with my esteemed colleague, Senator Mikulski, to introduce a highly respected leader in Maryland's scientific community, Dr. Michael Griffin, who is the President's nominee to serve as the next Administrator of NASA.;N
"He has his Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics from the Johns Hopkins University, and he has earned five master's degrees; Aerospace Science from Catholic University, Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, Applied Physics from Johns Hopkins, Civil Engineering from George Washington University, and Business Administration from Loyola College of Maryland.";D
He is currently the Space Department Head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County, Maryland.;N
Johns Hopkins APL is a nonprofit division of the Johns Hopkins University, and, under the strong leadership of Dr. Richard Rocca, serves as one of the premier research and development institutions in the nation.;N
For almost 50 years, APL's Space Division has played a central role in supporting our nation's civilian and military space programs.;N
The New York Times put it well in an editorial strongly supporting Dr. Griffin's nomination, entitled very simply but appropriately, ``A Talented Leader.'';N
He has held a number of leadership positions during his long career in both the public and private sectors.;D
They have demanded an extraordinarily high level of both scientific excellence and administrative capabilities.;N
Currently the head of APL's Space Division, Mike Griffin oversees a staff of over 600 employees, and a budget well in excess of $200 million.;N
He has, of course, had very important experience at NASA in the upper echelons as both the Chief Engineer and the Associate Administrator for Exploration.;D
In addition to his administrative and research interests, he has continued to do important academic work.;D
We think that the expertise and the passion that Mike Griffin brings to the job is exactly what is needed.;N
I am very pleased to come before the Committee today to very strongly endorse his nomination.;N
And I very much hope the Committee can act expeditiously and favorably on this nomination.;N
And not only does he, in fact, bring the credentials to the table that he is, in fact, a rocket scientist, he carries himself with great humility.;D
I am here really under two flags: One, the proud flag of Maryland, talking about one of Maryland's favorite sons, Dr. Mike Griffin, to be nominated for the NASA Administrator, and then the other as the Ranking Member on the Senate Appropriations Committee who has responsibility for the funding of NASA programs.;N
I want to thank President Bush for nominating such an outstanding candidate to head up NASA at this time of great strategic importance for NASA's future and also the fact that the NASA Administrator has to deal with the long-range plans and the short-range crises that we are now facing.;D
Under the Maryland flag, as Senator Sarbanes said, Mike Griffin is really a hometown guy, coming from Aberdeen, the home of Cal Ripken, Jr.;D
What is important about that is he brings those, what we call, those Ripken values, that Ripken way, to NASA.;N
To be the best of what you best can be and to work hard at it, to concentrate with a high level and degree of competence, but at the same time to put values into action, playing by the rules, serving your community, and being an outstanding citizen.;N
He has five master's degrees in a variety of engineering and physics, and also even an MBA from Loyola College.;D
Thank God that we are really going to have someone who understands what this is all about.;D
Because the very safety of our astronauts will depend on the quality of this NASA Administrator, as we get ready to return to flight.;N
Much has been made over the fact that he worked at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, heading their Space Department, knowing what earth science means, knowing what space science means, and knowing what it means to be a contractor and to meet the bottom line while serving the nation.;D
I am delighted and proud to introduce someone who is not a rocket scientist, but an expert on transportation and administration, to the Committee.;D
We have worked closely together on many transportation projects in New York State, and I think he will do a great job at FRA.;D
And I recommend him wholeheartedly, as does my colleague, Senator Clinton, who could not be here today.;N
Joe has been the head of the New York State Department of Transportation for the last 7 years.;D
He made a lifetime of working to make all modes of New York's transportation system safer and more efficient.;D
He has worked his way up from being manager of both the Transportation and Parking Authorities of Rome, New York, to Commissioner of Public Transportation in Broome County, in which Binghamton lies, to finally becoming the Commissioner of Transportation in 1997.;D
And New York has one of the largest and most complex transportation systems in the country.;N
Throughout these experiences, Commissioner Boardman showed that he possessed the unique knowledge of how essential, safe, fast, and easily accessible transportation is vital to local communities and to economic growth of entire states, regions, and across the country.;D
I am proud to say that, as Commissioner, Joe has expanded Amtrak service across New York, presiding over record growth in ridership.;D
He has enhanced his department's ability to inspect and crack down on rail safety violations and made safety a top priority.;D
Before I sat down with the Commissioner and spoke with him, he assured me he would fight hard for Amtrak.;D
We all know that is going to be a big, big fight in the Senate this year and in the budget.;N
And furthermore, with the recent revelations of safety lapses in our rail system, particularly our freight rail system, he has assured me he would focus on that.;D
I am proud to endorse his nomination and introduce him to this very, very special Committee.;N
Senator Inouye, distinguished Committee Members, it gives me great pleasure and it is indeed an honor to support this morning Bill Cobey, nominated to serve as a member of the Washington Airports Authority Board.;N
Bill has demonstrated a long and dedicated commitment to public service over the years for our Home State of North Carolina and our nation.;D
Without a doubt, one of the most rewarding and challenging projects I chose to undertake while serving as Secretary of Transportation was the task of moving National and Dulles International Airports out of the Federal Government.;N
I will never forget the night in 1984 when my husband and I were having a little pillow talk, Senator Inouye.;N
I later found that Bob was absolutely correct in predicting the journey to regional control would be a very tough one indeed.;N
But after 3 years of dedicated effort from a very talented team and the help of you, Senator Inouye, and other Committee Members, it passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Reagan.;D
In 1987, independent operation of Washington's two airports became a successful partnership.;N
The airports were able to raise the necessary funds through sales of tax-free bonds to provide for the capital improvements and expansions.;N
Today, Washington's two airports serve 39 million passengers annually with 1,069 daily flights to over 100 destinations throughout the United States and 36 countries worldwide.;N
It is the responsibility of the Washington Airports Authority Board to oversee the airports and their security, safety, development and maintenance.;N
I commend the board for their excellence in handling the more than 100,000 passengers who use the two airports on a daily basis.;N
And Senator Inouye, I thank you for your hard work in making that bill a bipartisan effort, which has indeed made air travel to and from our nation's capital far easier and less expensive.;D
I know that Bill Cobey will be a wonderful asset, will do a great job as an addition to the Airports Authority Board.;N
Bill has served his state and nation in many different capacities, and he has an outstanding list of accomplishments.;D
He received his undergraduate education from Emory University in Atlanta and then earned an MBA from the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and an M.Ed. in health and physical education from the University of Pittsburgh.;D
Prior to representing North Carolina in the U.S. Congress, Bill served as Governor Jim Martin's Deputy Secretary of Transportation and later as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources.;D
A devoted husband, father and grandfather, Bill is a man I am proud to call my friend, a man of tremendous character, a man committed to making our country better.;D
I thank you for this opportunity to express my admiration and respect for Bill Cobey, Mr. Chairman, and to present him to the Committee.;N
I am proud to be here today representing North Carolina, the home of this year's collegiate basketball champions and, as of last night, Miss USA.;N
And I am here today to fully endorse his nomination to the board of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority.;N
It should be noted that Bill was elected to the House of Representatives in 1984 and served with Senators McCain, Lott, Snowe, Dorgan, and Senator Boxer, all current Members of the Commerce Committee, as Members of the House in the 98th Congress.;D
While Bill's well-documented service to our state and country as a Congressman, cabinet secretary in Raleigh, and public university advocate qualify him for a position on the Authority's board, I believe it will be his background as an athletic director at one of the nation's most successful universities that will best serve the mission of the board.;D
Athletic directors are known for their tenacity in raising money and support for capital improvement projects.;N
And his success at the University of North Carolina and the success of the school's athletic program and what it enjoys today are the direct result of capital campaigns undertaken by the school during his tenure as athletic director.;N
His wealth of knowledge in these endeavors and deep reserve of people skills will position the Authority well as it prepares current and future capital improvements at Reagan and Dulles Airports.;D
And now it is my pleasure to call upon the first panel, Dr. Michael Griffin, nominated to be Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Mr. Joseph Boardman, nominated to be Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.;N
As Chairman of the NASA and Science Subcommittee, I just want to say how pleased I am with the nomination of Dr. Michael Griffin, because I think having his leadership, his expertise, his knowledge at this time when we are trying to get the return to flight and set NASA on its mission for the next 50 years, I think having a leader such as Michael Griffin will enable us to get a clear focus of where we want NASA to go.;D
We are going to have several hearings in our Committee to talk about the importance of the Shuttle, and the Space Station.;N
But I do want to ask the Chairman and the Ranking Member to consider trying to get Dr. Griffin's nomination out of the Senate this week.;N
And having the, not permanent leader of NASA, but certainly the designated leader of NASA on board by Monday would help accomplish the return to flight on that timetable.;D
So Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can expedite his votes from the Committee and further have this on the Senate floor before we leave this week.;N
And if you can honor Senator Hutchison's request to expedite this nomination to the floor so that he could be in place the beginning of next week, I think it would serve the Nation well.;N
And I ask, first of all, unanimous consent that my full statement would be put in the record.;N
Without objection, and Senator Schumer's statement introducing Mr. Boardman will appear, too.;N
Just in a short word, Mr. Chairman, we are fortunate to have the kind of candidates for these lofty positions that we do have.;N
And I think fair to say that Amtrak and passenger rail service is a primary concern of mine, not the only one.;N
But I am worried, Mr. Boardman, what might happen if Amtrak, for instance, stopped running the Empire service from New York City to Niagara Falls or the Adirondack trains from New York City to Montreal.;N
Now, would--the city of New York--you have experience there--be prepared to pick up the costs to continue those operations?;N
Yes, but Mr. Boardman, you are aware of the fact that the recommendation by the President would abolish much, if not all, of Amtrak's services.;N
And I asked you the question deliberately about the service on the two lines we were just discussing.;N
Is New York State--and you said that, you know, you said that no state is going to step up voluntarily to do it.;N
The question is: With your unique experience in New York State and in railroading for such a long time, transportation, will New York State be able to fully take over the responsibility of running the railroad from New York City on north in these two lines?;N
Well, is supporting with the money included or supporting it in a philosophical kind of thing?;N
Because what we are looking at is a question of whether or not we have the resources to continue to provide this intercity passenger rail service.;N
So New York State, it is in your belief that New York State would step up and provide all of the services that are presently there on their own, without assistance from Amtrak.;N
You might be able to run all kinds of things, but without the appropriate amount of fuel and resource, it cannot happen.;N
Now as Chairman of AASHTO's Standing Committee on Rail Transportation, you are responsible for the report that stressed the primary role of the Federal Government to ensure adequate funding for passenger rail.;N
Now, we have a zero proposal, a proposal of zero level for funding on passenger rail in this Fiscal Year 2006 budget.;N
But when you throw in a condition like that, when there has been so much cost reduction, personnel reduction and so forth.;N
How do you ensure that the freight railroads, for instance, will give reasonable scheduling priority so that the freight delays will not hamper passenger service, which often occurs?;N
So might we suggest that the same thing should be done with Amtrak, to give them the kind of support that they need?;N
If it was a significant assist for the freight service, then why should we not try to duplicate that for passenger rail service?;N
I am informed that we are now on the defense supplemental, and Senator Inouye and I may be called.;N
Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I am going to be brief, because our nominee for NASA is obviously the right person at the right time of leadership.;D
I am going to submit, with your permission, a number of detailed questions that I would like to have for the record, as we, well, as Dr. Griffin leads this agency out of the wilderness.;N
I want to, if I may, just take a couple of moments here to have you state for the record what we have already talked about in private--which I find your views compelling--on such as using your ability in your new position to enable NASA to improve its decision-making process on, example, accepting certain risks before we return to flight.;N
And I confirm your concern as a leader, that I have often felt that the last two tragedies that we have had in NASA, first Challenger and then Columbia, although destruction for different technical reasons, really, it was a common theme.;D
Share with the Committee your concern about the potential hiatus where we would be without an American vehicle for human access to space perhaps in a situation for years relying upon the Russians and where the geopolitics would take us in those years, that suddenly Russia might not be a reliable person, a reliable partner, for access to space, for human access to space.;N
Share your thoughts about that hiatus between the schedule of 2010, shutting down the Shuttle, and several years later possibly before we would have the crew exploration vehicle ready to go.;N
Mr. Chairman, I would only ask at some point in the nominee's testimony, if he might share his vision for the future of NASA, because I think we will hear a refreshing statement.;N
It is my understanding that the Senator's questions as submitted for the record would not be intended to hold up the confirmation process.;N
It has, as I have discussed with Dr. Griffin, been of great concern to me that we would have a 5-;N
I think it is, in addition to a potential problem in stopping the science that is done at the Shuttle, I mean at the Space Station, I think it is a security issue for our country when we are seeing, as you pointed out, other countries going into space.;N
And certainly when I am able to hold our Subcommittee hearings, I will have you back, and we will be able to discuss these things more fully.;N
But of the priorities that I have after return to flight, the 5-year hiatus is the biggest.;N
You said something in your opening statement that you support the Space Station, but we have to make sure that putting people in space is for a mission worthy of the risk.;N
But I want to make sure that we also have the commitment to our international partners to finish the Space Station and that we look for the ways to enhance the science so that it is worthy of the efforts that we are making, both in the medical research, which we are now doing, and potentially with geophysical research, from what we might get on the moon and then maybe into the long-term future, Mars.;N
And I just wanted to ask you if you are committed to finishing the Space Station and if you have other ideas about the kinds of science that we can do that would be worthy of the risk of manned space flight.;N
So you can foresee that there could be equipment testing, as perhaps we go back and forth to the moon, that could--I mean, to--I am sorry, to the moon that could also eventually help us in knowing what it would take to go to Mars? ;N
And I was very pleased to work on this with him because of a situation that happened in San Antonio, Texas, last year where--and it just--it happens in other parts of the country as well.;N
It just happened that we had a huge wreck and it was going through a major metropolitan area.;N
And we know that hazardous materials carriage going through metropolitan areas is an issue that affects many communities.;N
Our bill would require railroads to improve inspections of welded track, develop tank car safety standards, and ask, or actually direct, the FRA to do a relevant rulemaking.;N
And I just wanted to ask you if you are familiar with this issue and if you are committed to better inspection capabilities by the railroads and better oversight from the FRA and also the issue of tank car integrity.;N
Senators, I have urged the staff to notify absent Senators, but we will meet in the President's room right after the next vote or at 2:15 today, whichever occurs first, on the nomination.;N
My time is short here so, Mr. Griffin, I would like to focus some questions with you first.;N
Something that has been in the news recently is the Hubble Spacecraft, or the Hubble Telescope.;N
And I am hearing, I guess, conflicting reports, or maybe I do not understand exactly what is going on.;N
I think that some are saying we should just pretty much abandon it and let it die, and others are saying no, we can send up some sort of robotic spacecraft and get it, you know, reworked for a longer life.;N
In fact, as I understand it, NASA's auditors have not been able to conduct an audit for three of the last 4 years.;N
And the last question I wanted to ask is not so much about space flight or even agency but science and education.;N
Well, I tell you what, I will just write out a question for you for the record, and not to hold up the confirmation, but I would like your thoughts on that.;N
But let me tell you, every time you come before this Committee, I am going to voice concern about the Aeronautics Industry.;N
I think everyone in this Committee, whether they are from Alaska or from Virginia or from Texas or from anywhere else, are concerned about the aeronautics funding because air travel affects us all.;N
One of the great strengths in the 20th century, of America and its leadership, was in aeronautics.;N
For the first time ever, going from 90 percent of the commercial aviation market in the 1940s, we for the first time have come in second last year, down to 45 percent of global sales.;N
This current administration and this proposed budget proposes another cut in half, which is forcing some of our research centers to lay off capable, uniquely skilled individuals, who are not readily found in the market.;N
Moreover, there is a concern about young people in engineering, particularly aeronautical engineering.;N
This certainly does not send a positive message, if we care to be a leader in aeronautics, which I think is important for our security and for prosperity in this country.;N
When one looks at all the developments and the improvements in aviation over the years, many of those, whether it is civilian or for military aircraft, came from the R&D, the high-;N
risk research that was done at our research centers, NASA research centers, around the country.;N
Now I understand that you have yet to be confirmed as Administrator, but I would like for you to explain to me and to our Committee the rationale behind the dramatic cuts in the new vehicle systems program, which is conducting research on the feasibility of hypersonic flight.;N
Could you share with me and our Committee the rationale for these further drastic cuts in aeronautics and, moreover, why the cuts in the new vehicle systems?;N
Well, in the event that we are going to address the concerted plan, which they are effectuating in Europe to dominate by the year 2020, and they are investing a great deal, billions of dollars, in research and development, and producing quality aircraft, do you see cutting research and development for new vehicle systems in aeronautics as a way of addressing that competitive challenge that we are facing, which is important, again, for our military, for civilian aircraft and it actually is also good for our balance of trade.;N
So do you see cutting research and development by half again, so it is about one-quarter of what it was 10 years ago, do you see that as a logical, rational way of handling this or addressing it?;N
Understand, in our private conversation we discussed this as well, how important I feel this is for the future of our country.;N
I feel that we ought to be concerned that, for example, the most advanced fighter must be tested overseas in wind tunnels in Europe, because our own country has failed to invest in our own wind tunnels.;N
And so it is my view that--I know there are a lot of priorities and we do need to be in the lead in space, but we also need to be paying attention to the very practical, beneficial aspects of research and development here in this country, working with the private sector, working with defense, in aeronautics.;N
And I just cannot countenance seeing the atrophying of a very capable skilled work force plus the encouragement for the future with these, I think, penny-wise-;N
And I hope to work with my colleagues to improve the aeronautics funding, particularly for the new vehicle system, which is important for the future.;N
Senator, I will be happy to discuss with you sometime the availability of money for that research and the redundancy of the current research.;N
And to Mr. Boardman, as you may know or may not know, we in Hawaii have one narrow-gauge railroad.;N
Mr. Chairman, I have been called to respond to an amendment by Senator Cochran, but I did want to say that I have known Nancy Nord for longer than I even want to say, at least 30 years.;N
Ms. Nancy Nord has been nominated to be Commissioner of Consumer Products Safety Commission.;N
The Honorable William Cobey is nominated to be a member of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.;N
Let me ask you if you have family with you today that you wish to introduce for the record, either of you?;N
And my opening statement, which I placed in the record, I identified your backgrounds, each of you.;N
Currently the agency has a cap on the fines, $7,000 per product with a ceiling of 1.65 million.;N
We have been receiving letters and e-mail from other interested parties citing, for example, that on June 2003 Endovascular Technologies was fined over $92 million in civil and criminal penalties by FDA.;N
And large corporations can factor certain civil penalties into their cost of doing business.;N
It is my pleasure to present to the Committee Dr. William Jeffrey, of Herndon, Virginia, who's been nominated by the President to be the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.;N
Technology-based innovation, as you know, Mr. Chairman, remains one of the nation's most important competitive challenges.;N
Today, more than at any other time in our history, technological innovation and progress depend on the tools that NIST helps develop to measure, evaluate, and standardize the technologies that emerge.;N
As a result of NIST's work on these tools, we're putting our companies, here in the United States, at the forefront of innovation.;N
When I say the President has made a wise choice, if you look at Dr. Jeffrey's technical leadership skills, his experience both in government and the private sector, make him, truly, an outstanding choice to serve as Director of NIST.;D
Now, we know, as good politicians, when we want to build a crowd, we need to call Mr. Hernandez, because he has brought a crowd here today.;N
I'm very pleased to be able to introduce my fellow Texan, Israel Hernandez, who has been nominated for the positions of--;N
to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service.;N
His hard work and dedication earned him the position of Deputy Assistant to the President, after the President was elected.;D
Mr. Hernandez assisted in strategic planning and intergovernmental affairs at the White House during the President's first term.;N
Currently, he is the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Commerce and the Acting Under Secretary for International Trade.;D
He has worked so hard his whole life, and this is the area in which he will excel for sure.;D
He graduated from the University of Texas, and he was in the first class to graduate from the George Bush--George H.W. Bush School of Government and Public Affairs at Texas A&M University.;D
do think that he's going to do a great job, and I highly recommend him to our Commerce Committee and for confirmation in the Senate.;D
Well, Mr. Hernandez, you've been nominated to join one of the outstanding leaders, I think, of our country, in Mr. Gutierrez.;D
And in your written statement you mention a strategic vision for foreign and commercial service.;N
And, after the in-depth conversation I had with him, I'm convinced he will make a superb Assistant Secretary.;N
As you've indicated, Mr. Hawley's experience with the Transportation post, I think this experience would be most helpful in this new position.;D
Do you believe that TSA is the central place where direction and policymaking decisions be made involving all modes of transportation?;N
And I think everybody would agree--I hope they would--that the Senate Commerce Committee has really led the way in pushing for increased federal efforts to help secure our nation's passenger and freight railroads.;D
As a former railroad employee with Union Pacific, do you believe that the TSA is doing enough to help railroads meet security needs?;N
you know enough to comment on Amtrak and what needs to be done to make Amtrak more secure?;N
Supposedly, there have been some studies, and the sense is that inline baggage screening systems would save money by increasing efficiency and effectiveness.;N
Now, one last line of questioning, if you will, and that is, after 9/11, you--as I understand it, you helped coordinate the federalized airport screening mission at TSA?;N
What role did you play in the contracting for services to develop the screener work-force?;N
So, does that mean that, for example, you would--you were not involved in setting the staffing level for the number of screeners?;N
As you've noted, you'll be the first Administrator of RITA, so you would have a wide latitude in shaping the goals and policy of this new agency within DOT.;N
I was sitting here thinking of a friend of mine, now deceased, who was spending his time trying to figure out how to use helium-filled balloons to lift containers off the ground and propel them, with some sort of an engine, so that they would move throughout the country without being on the roads.;N
Sensing all the nominees are eager to get to work, I ask that my statement be made part of the record.;N
The Members of this Committee, of course, know well the very significant work of the National Transportation Safety Board.;N
They provide independent federal oversight for all civil aviation accidents in the U.S., as well as investigatory responsibility for significant tragedies on our waterways, railroads, and highways.;N
She then was on the White House Domestic Policy Council during the Carter Administration as Assistant Director for Employment Policy.;D
She then went to work on Capitol Hill, including 4 years as the minority staff director on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and then went over to the House side and served as Chief of Staff for 7 years for Congressman Sandy Levin who, Mr. Chairman, is here with us this morning.;D
She joined the Clinton Administration in 1993 as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Labor.;D
She left the Labor Department in 1995, became Assistant to the President and Secretary to the Cabinet.;D
As Cabinet Secretary, she was the key administrative official in the coordination of the response to a number of important natural and national disasters, including the ValuJet and the TWA flight 800 crashes.;D
So she has dealt extensively in that position with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and knows intimately their work.;D
In March 1997, she was nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Labor, unanimously confirmed by the Senate in that post.;D
So she was at the Labor Department as the Chief Operating Officer of the Department beginning in 1997.;D
She has also served as Vice Chair of the Presidential Council on the U.S. Coast Guard Roles and Missions, and when she left the Federal Government, she was at the National Trust for Historic Preservation for 5 years.;D
She is an enormously accomplished, skilled, knowledgeable, and effective government servant.;D
She has carried out very significant responsibilities in her various positions over the course of her career.;D
And I have every confidence she will do an absolutely outstanding job as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, and I commend her very strongly to the Committee.;D
I have two letters, one from Senator Barbara Mikulski, the other from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, supporting Kathryn O'Leary Higgins for this position.;N
I also want to say to Ms. Dale, living a lot of places around the country, thank you also for choosing Virginia as your place of residence as well.;D
He has impressive qualifications, and I know you have it as part of the record for this nomination.;D
Since his confirmation more than 2\1/2\ and a half years ago, Mark Rosenker has demonstrated himself to be a qualified and energized member of this important federal agency.;D
I suspect during your comments, the Chairman will ask you to introduce your bride and any other colleagues or friends who are here who have come to support your nomination.;N
During his tenure, Mr. Chairman, Mark has brought a wealth of management and advocacy experience to the board.;D
With more than 36 years of active and reserve duty in the Air Force, having risen to the rank of major general, Mark's decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit and two Meritorious Service Medals, which is outstanding for somebody to be serving on the National Transportation Safety Board.;N
I think because of his unique combination of private sector and military experience, President Bush appointed Mark to be Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Military Office.;D
After serving for 2 years in that White House position, President Bush nominated Mark to serve in his current position at the NTSB.;D
Since he was confirmed in March of 2003, President Bush has twice designated Mark to serve in the role of Vice Chairman, and since March of this year, Mark has been serving with distinction as Acting Chairman of the NTSB.;D
During this time on the board, Mark has been a strong and outspoken advocate for transportation safety.;D
For his leadership role and in a variety of ways, but particularly in recreational boating issues, the National Safe Boating Council presented their highest honor, the Confluence Award, to him.;D
This is traditionally given to Members of Congress, and Mark Rosenker is one of the very few executive branch people to receive this award.;D
The aviation industry also acknowledges his leadership role in the challenging issue of preventing runway incursions.;D
He has been outspoken in attempting to get the FAA to require that all children under the age of 2 be secured in safety belts while flying.;N
I think all the passengers would like that, and so long as they are loose enough that the kids can lay over, if they are asleep and quiet, that probably would be fine as well as a parent.;N
He was presented with their 2001 Distinguished Centennial Graduate Award, which is quite an honor.;D
Clearly, Mark Rosenker, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, has demonstrated that he is capable and enthusiastic about the Board and its mission, and I respectfully urge my colleagues to swiftly support his reconfirmation.;D
We have a letter of support here for Ms. Shana Dale from Representative Ralph Hall, and I had several personal phone calls from the administrator saying why had you not been the subject of hearings.;N
Senator I would say in my experience with the Board and looking at some of the current issues, I think there are a number of things that are of concern.;N
I think the IG report that has already been mentioned raises some very troubling issues, and I know that is of concern to the Committee.;N
I know it is a focus of the Vice Chairman and will be, obviously, an important concern to those of us who hope to serve on the Board.;N
There are some other areas that are of interest, for example, the nexus between safety and security.;N
It proved to be an accident, but obviously security has come to the forefront in the last few years, and I am interested in making sure that the focus on safety for all modes of transportation is not being jeopardized by the increased focus on national security.;N
I think there is a concern that we all share about the number of recent accidents in foreign countries on foreign carriers.;N
Our safety record in aviation here has been pretty good the last couple of years, but there are an increasing number of fatal accidents occurring abroad.;N
It made a number of very important recommendations, particularly in the aviation area, about the work of the Board, the needs of the staff.;N
I would hope, if confirmed, to go back to that report and begin to ask some questions about which of those recommendations should get more attention.;N
We need to make sure that there is the training and other kinds of things that the staff there need to get the job done.;N
However, as you are well aware, last week GAO issued a report citing that they submitted 45 recommendations to NASA in 2003, and of that number, 3 have been implemented and I believe 13 partially implemented.;N
What are your thoughts on the fact that airline accidents are now being diminished as compared to other accidents, rail and highways and such?;N
I realize that with 43,000 highway fatalities, you do not have the time to investigate even 1 percent of them.;N
But we note that too large a proportion of those involve teenagers and it also involves exceeding speeds.;N
Mr. Rosenker, every life is valuable whether it is 1 or 1,000, and when you compare the fatality rate on the highways with Iraq, Iraq seems to be a very safe place.;N
Ms. Higgins, in this war on terrorism, we require by law and we mandate that certain things occur, and yet the potential for death and destruction on our highways is much greater than what terrorism has wrecked upon us.;N
Do you think that we should go beyond recommendations and just say this is the way it is going to be done?;N
I know that oftentimes NASA's headlines or news coverage tend to be dominated by the human space flight program, and we understand that.;N
But NASA does many other things, and one of the things you have had at NASA, at the agency, is you have had an initiative on nanotechnology, which I think is really potentially very, very significant.;N
I know research institutions in my state are very focused on nanotechnology, as they are around the country, and it really has a very promising future I believe.;N
How do you find the appropriate balance between human space flight and the other very important scientific missions that NASA has? ;N
I know that in September NASA released its exploration architecture study which includes a plan to return to the moon with Apollo-style capsules, I believe around the year 2018.;N
As I understand the plan, NASA is going to try to find savings within existing programs in order to shift resources to this return to the moon.;N
But as I understand it, maybe one of the areas of savings might be with the Shuttle program, but news reports have indicated that over the next 5 years, the Shuttle will actually need more money, not less, to operate.;N
Now, Mr. Rosenker and Ms. Higgins, in Arkansas we had a train accident on October 15 in Texarkana, Arkansas, which straddles the line between Arkansas and Texas.;N
Apparently it collided with another Union Pacific train that was stationary on the tracks.;N
It killed one Arkansan, hospitalized 20 other people, destroyed two homes and a rail bridge, and 700 people had to be evacuated from their homes temporarily due to the release of some gas or at least a feared release of some gas.;N
I understand about the complexity, but on something like this where a train just hits another train in the station, do you think it will be 10 months or longer, or do you have some sense of that?;N
Well, like you said, I want you to be very thorough, but I just appreciate your keeping me informed as that continues.;N
In fact, if everything goes well, we will have a markup on your nomination tomorrow, which is quite extraordinary.;N
Otherwise, you can be assured that it will be done within a week so you will be hard at work within a week.;N
Both you have great experiences in antitrust work, but as you know your responsibilities will be much broader than that.;D
Well if I may followup, I'm certain that you are well aware that GAO issued the report in May of 2004 suggesting that the FTC mergers of these oil companies resulted in high prices.;N
Knowing that, would you favor the Congress as suggested, or alluded to by the Chair consider amending the laws so that you would have authority to enforce--take enforcement action.;N
Not just investigate in the case of price gouging, because you did have price gouging, $6 a gallon for no reason whatsoever.;N
Is there any other agency with the authority to enforce price gouging, anti-price gouging laws, short of collusion?;N
We're now in the process of considering amendments to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, and we find for example that words are now in our vocabulary that never appeared in those days such as spyware.;N
Gentlemen, we hear too much I think about the global economy on the news media and other places.;N
But as a matter of fact the Commission's practices have been to look at our own economy in determining what is fair competition, what is necessary in terms of acquisitions, mergers.;N
To what extent should the policies of the FTC change because of the advent of the participants in the global economy?;N
We have global giants now, the German post office, really indirectly owns one of the air carriers in the United States now.;N
We have so many different entities coming in from China that are really--they're purchasing part of our infrastructure, but they're competing literally through one of our own corporate shells with our existing economy.;N
Have you looked at this in terms of whether the Chairman should broaden our scope as far as determining what is competition and who we're competing with as far as the FTC is concerned?;N
Is it strictly interstate commerce that we should be dealing with, or are we going to be in your terms looking at global commerce?;N
I just want to emphasize the point that you brought up that it is a problem for us, not just on the Commerce Committee, but also on the Defense Committee and right now we're coping with a major decision, should we open up purchases to the world when we know that the manufacturers in certain countries are being subsidized by their governments and not paying taxes that our manufacturers would have to pay, but they happen to be our allies.;N
I think you're exceptionally qualified, each one of you and we congratulate you and as a matter of fact envy you, as lawyers with an opportunity to serve at the FTC during this critical period of our history.;D
Today's hearing will be short, so I will forego a lengthy statement so that the nominees can answer any questions that may need to be addressed to them by the Committee Members.;N
Although, Senator Rockefeller, if you would like to speak at great length, certainly you would be recognized to do so.;N
On April 4, 2005, the President nominated Dr. David Sampson to be Deputy Secretary of Commerce.;N
But thank you, Mrs. Sampson, for sacrificing to allow your husband to serve his country in this way.;N
Today's witnesses may have learned a little bit about the importance of fish to Members of this Committee.;N
I did have a large chart with a smiling fish so you would think National Marine Fisheries Service every morning, Dr. Sampson.;N
And also, Mr. Sullivan, you currently serve as Deputy General Counsel of the Defense Department.;D
This is a credit to you to be recognized, to be nominated for these very important positions.;N
Mr. Sullivan, both you and Dr. Sampson, you are going to have very critical positions at the Department of Commerce.;D
I did not have a chance to talk to Mr. Sullivan, but I had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Sampson.;N
And we discussed the importance of manufacturing, the importance of jobs, the importance of what do you do when people 48 years old, you know--and nobody has really good answers.;N
International trade, we discussed, and the importance of having fair trade, as well as free trade.;N
Sometimes it is easy to say both, but hard to differentiate when it comes to the practice of it.;N
I expressed to you the importance of just you, as an individual, to this country and to my state.;N
We are honored to have with us this morning to speak on behalf of Dr. Sampson, I believe, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is a very valued Member of this Committee.;N
Senator Hutchison, we would be glad to open with your statement and, after that, have you join us, if you can, at the podium.;N
He is an assistant secretary now and has done a terrific job as the principal advisor on policy development to the Secretary.;N
And in his role as directing operations of the Economic Development Administration, he initiated a reorganization of that part of the Commerce Department for the first time in the 37 years of the Department of Commerce history.;N
Also, in addition to his professional background, he has a wonderful track record of vision and character and commitment to whatever job he holds.;N
Before he assumed his present job at the Department of Commerce, he was involved in economic development activities at the state level in Texas.;D
He was appointed by then Governor Bush to serve as Vice Chairman of the Texas Strategic Economic Development Planning Commission and then later chaired the Texas Council on Workforce and Economic Competitiveness.;D
So I think he has had deep experience in exactly what we want the Commerce Department to do.;D
And that is find ways to create a better economic climate in our country and create more jobs and keep our industry in America and make sure that we have a healthy business climate in our country.;N
I am really pleased to learn of his experience in economic development and his knowledge of a variety of issues at the Commerce Department.;D
When you look at the Commerce Department, it has a huge jurisdictional responsibility, all the way from trade to fisheries and other economic development.;N
Let us go ahead with John Sullivan and his testimony on behalf of his nomination to be General Counsel of the Department of Commerce.;N
You certainly have plenty of legal experience and good experience working as the Deputy General Counsel at the Department of Defense.;D
I also noted that you served as a law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals----;D
Whether you agree with his decisions or not, he certainly has a well-earned reputation for having some of the brightest and subsequently most successful law clerks of just about any appellate court judge in this country.;D
And in a moment I would recognize him for a statement or any questions he would like to make.;N
This is parochial perhaps in nature, but it certainly involves a broad part of the country.;N
I grew up on the banks of the Pascagoula River rowing in a small skiff six miles off the coast to the nearest island, Round Island.;N
I grew up next door to shrimpers and oystermen and red snapper fishermen and hardworking, great men and women, who worked tough hours but are really great people, too.;N
And so for 36 years in my public career as a staff member, as a Congressman and a Senator, I have been working to try to be sensitive to particularly the Gulf of Mexico fisheries in general, at all levels, conservation, sports, and commercial.;N
And I must confess my bent toward commercial because I do think that they are farming the seas and are an important part of our economy.;N
They provide a lot of income to the economy and a good living for the people that participate.;N
They are quite often influenced or affected by the weather and, you know, overfishing, which they have to control.;N
But for years, I have been battling for fisheries in the Gulf, quite often a pretty lonely battle and only with marginal success.;N
Between 2003 and 2005, the portion of the NMFS going to the Gulf of Mexico varied between 7 to 9 percent, only 7 to 9 percent, while the portion of the Nation's fish caught in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 17 percent by weight, 21 percent by value.;N
Meanwhile, the percentage of NMFS budget being held at headquarters has risen from 20 to 24 percent.;N
We are supposed to be pushing more money out of this city of what is available into where the rubber meets the road or the hook hits the water.;N
Secretary Evans, when he left, he sent me a nice letter with a fish at the bottom, drawn on the bottom of this letter.;N
I asked him to provide me with apportionment by region of the Administration's 2006 request for NMFS, the justification for it, how they are going to adjust this inadequacy.;N
Now at the very minimum, you talk about respect, Mr. Sullivan, for the Congress and the Committee.;N
It seems to me that while you may not be able to comply with our request for the region, you could at least provide the information on what the situation is and what the situation is going to be.;N
Now Senator Hutchison from Texas and Senator Bill Nelson from Florida and Senator Rockefeller from the north side of the Gulf would all appreciate your cooperation.;N
During the Clinton Administration, it was the Department of Commerce that was meant to decide what was going to happen about steel policy.;N
Now when I bring up the word steel policy, Chairman Lott tends to die, because he says, ``Here we go again.'';N
And there was a very interesting dynamic which caused a fairly substantial rift, actually, between myself and President Clinton for a number of years.;N
And that is that the Department of Commerce sort of discusses what should be our policy with WTO, what should be our policy with the trade representatives, that, too, but what should be our policy about making sure that we keep manufacturing, that the steel industry remain healthy.;N
We understand that Brazil and China and others are--the Department of Commerce's policy was pretty good.;N
The problem was that when we would have meetings of the steel caucus, it was Secretary Ruben who became the Department of Commerce.;N
And in fact, he, I think, influenced the President to back away from his commitment to West Virginia to try and help our steel industry.;N
And the result was our steel industries have been through bankruptcies and all kinds of situations.;N
And I care about that because now, as Governor, I literally--with Weirton Steel, which I think is the eighth largest producer, they were about to close down because of labor-management strife.;N
And I went up with some people and spent a number of weeks and actually turned it around, saved it.;N
But what was interesting is the fact that there is the State Department, there is Treasury, there is monetary policy, there are all kinds of other things.;N
The Department of Commerce economic decisions, manufacturing decisions, never stand on their own, because in a sense they cannot, because they are just part of the picture.;N
So once you say something is part of the larger picture, then that tends to marginalize what you might be trying to think of in the Department of Treasury or the Treasury of the United States would say: Well, no we cannot do that because we have this and that political problem, or somebody else would say: Well, we have special problems with China or Brazil, other things that we have to tend to.;N
And I am interested in your sort of reaction on the part of each of you to that very real situation.;N
I do not mimic the situation, but it was one that turned out to be very destructive to us.;N
Which, before I call on Mr. Sullivan, leads me to the second part of that, which is that you are quite right that the President got very high marks in West Virginia for doing the Section 201.;N
But what happened thereafter, almost nobody in West Virginia really understood, or across the country understands where steel is produced.;N
And that is that Bob Zoellick, then USTR, took 95 percent of what the Section 201 covered and exempted it from Section 201.;N
And it is that pull between agencies and pull between larger and smaller priorities, which is interesting to me.;N
And I understand he is a tremendously credentialed person for this high-level executive responsibility of Number 2 in the Department.;D
And what the legislation does, it says that if there is a competitive alternative to a government website, that the government cannot compete with the competitive alternative.;N
At the direction of President Bush upon his inauguration, he directed that all the agencies of government would come out with a website so that information would be freely and quickly available to the people of the United States.;N
This particular website for the National Weather Service was especially helpful and critical when four hurricanes hit my state within a 6-week period starting last hurricane season, as a matter of fact.;N
Now I do not know what the weather is like in Pennsylvania, but I know getting information about hurricanes can be a matter of life and death to people in Florida, as was the case.;N
As a matter of fact, there were recorded nine billion, with a b, hits on the National Weather Service website during that 6-week period of those hurricanes.;N
The most up until that point had been the six million hits on the NASA website when the Rover landed on the surface of Mars.;N
Now what Senator Santorum's bill S. 786 would do would require the elimination of the website because there is a company in his state, AccuWeather, that offers the same information.;N
And I hope I do not have to come see you in the future to remind you of your statement today.;N
And Mr. Chairman, I would just say in passing that I want to commend to you the service that NOAA does and the hurricane trackers.;N
I have flown on those hurricane hunters, in fact was flying on the one when the first hurricane, Charlie, was south of Cuba, as they are dropping the sondes in predesignated points along the route, measuring all kinds of data.;N
It comes back to the airplane real time, is formulated and sent by satellite to the National Hurricane Center, which then computes the data which gives us so much of a better accuracy in predicting the path and the ferociousness of a hurricane.;N
So having been there and seen what the valuable service is, I would commend that to you as you get into the deliberations on those hurricane hunters.;N
Senator Nelson, you do know where the Air Force's hurricane hunters originate from, do you not?;N
And I would like to welcome all of you, the nominees, and thank you for your commitment to service for our country.;N
He had no connection whatsoever with Utah, which was a little unusual in the people that we interviewed, because we tried to get people who had some tie to Utah.;D
But he had a background that fit the responsibilities that I was assuming as a member of the Banking Committee.;D
And so, we worked him pretty hard, and late hours, but somehow he managed to slip in a courtship into his activity, and now he's here with a wife and two children.;N
While we were on the Banking Committee, after the Republicans took control and--I was made chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, and we began to hold a hearing--series of hearings on technology.;N
I said to him, ``I hear something about the millennium challenge, the change of computers when we go from 1999 to 2000.;N
Senator Dodd, as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, was there, and, at the end of the subcommittee hearing, he said to me, ``Mr. Chairman, we need another hearing.;N
And out of the series of hearings that we held in the Banking Committee, which Robert managed, came the creation of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, with myself as chairman and Senator Dodd as the vice chairman.;N
And we started looking around for a high-powered staff director to run that committee, and it pretty soon became pretty clear we already had one.;N
Robert Cresanti was there and available, and he became the staff director of that committee.;N
"If everything goes well, they'll say there was no problem and we wasted everybody's money; and if it doesn't go well, they'll say it was all our fault.''";N
But the series of hearings that were set up for the Year-2000 technology problem were, I think, the Senate at its very best.;N
And we had a series of hearings that I think contributed significantly to the fact that the country did come through the 2000 computer time change without any difficulties.;N
He then did, as many of our staffers do when they've established a reputation for themselves, he was in great demand downtown, and he left Congressional service to go with trade associations downtown.;D
But he had made the transition, if you will, from a young, inexperienced, but anxious, staff aide focusing on financial problems to a very experienced, carefully trained expert on technology.;D
And when he told me that he had been approached to become an Under Secretary for Commerce, focusing on technology, I said, ``I'm glad for the American people that you'd be willing to do this, but are you willing to take the pay cut?'';D
So, I can recommend him from more than a dozen years of very direct personal experience, and assure the Committee that he comes very well prepared, very well trained, and, just as important, if not more so, anxious to return to public service and make available to the American people the skills that he has accumulated over the past dozen years.;D
I am pleased to be before the Committee this afternoon to introduce a fellow Alaskan and a friend, Vice Admiral Thomas Barrett, the President's nominee to serve as the Administrator for Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration at the Department of Transportation.;N
I've had the privilege of knowing the admiral and his wife since my service in the Alaska State Legislature.;N
and I shouldn't say ``rare,'' because I think we have an opportunity up north, as you know, Mr. Chairman, to get some of our--of the military's finest serving us up north, but when the admiral was in Juneau serving the Coast Guard in that region, I think it is fair to say that we knew we were served by one of the finest--and not just from the perspective of the Coast Guard, but an individual who became involved in the community.;N
We had an opportunity for the social events and having a Sunday morning brunch talking about education concerns in the State of Alaska.;N
This gentleman is one who not only has his focus on the job before him, but in providing a true quality of life for people, wherever his assignment.;N
He deployed to Vietnam, earned a law degree from George Washington University, a graduate of the Army War College.;D
He was in the--he was chief counsel and project staff for the Outer Continental Shelf Safety Staff, Office of Marine Safety and Environmental Protection.;D
He had several tours in Alaska before moving up to the post of commanding officer of the Coast Guard Support Center, home to nine commands on Kodiak Island, the--which, as you know, is the largest operational Coast Guard base in the world.;D
When we look at the position that Admiral Barrett has been nominated for, when it comes to the area of safety, when it comes to the area of leadership, I don't think that the President could have selected a finer individual.;D
I'm pleased to recommend him to the Committee, and know that he will continue to serve this country well.;N
It's good to see so many people who are residents of Virginia here, Mr. Cresanti and Mr. Barrett, but I'm going to specifically introduce three nominees, who are residents of Virginia, to the Committee.;N
The three fellow Virginians are all being nominated for posts within the Department of Transportation: Nicole Nason, Tyler Duvall, and David Sanborn.;N
As a young girl, she watched as her father ran the traffic division in Suffolk County, New York.;D
She was taught, early and often, the value of safety through the strong example set by her father.;N
I know she'll carry these values with her as she prepares to assume a new position within the Department of Transportation in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.;D
During her time with the Department of Transportation, she has worked tirelessly to promote a close working relationship between the Administration and Congress.;D
I think that will be invaluable for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as they're slated to work with this committee, Mr. Chairman, on a number of important issues, like reform of vehicle fuel efficiency standards and combating impaired driving.;N
But I know that Tyler, in his own right, is a product of outstanding Virginia schools, Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia School of Law.;N
Tyler has extensive experience advising the Secretary of Transportation on a broad range of transportation policy and legal issues related to surface and maritime transportation.;D
I am confident, Mr. Chairman and Senator Inouye, that Tyler will be a top-quality Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy.;D
Finally, I would like to introduce another fine Virginian, David Sanborn of Smithfield, Virginia, who the President nominated to serve as Administrator of the Maritime Administration.;N
David has impressive credentials and a wealth of experience, both domestically and internationally, but, most importantly, has a sincere desire and vision to promote our Nation's ports and shipping industry.;D
If you look through his record--most recently, director of ship operations for Dubai Ports International, or DP World, he was responsible for port infrastructure, expansion, and efficiency while developing new lines of business.;D
He has worked for CMA-CGM America, which is a company based out of Norfolk, Virginia, where he controlled cargo logistics and demonstrated his ability to seamlessly coordinate shipping with rail and truck operations.;D
This is a multimillion-dollar budget that he has to oversee there, staff of hundreds, redesigning organizations.;N
I look forward to this committee working with him and all three of these nominees for swift confirmation so they can get to work with full portfolio for the American people.;N
Well, then we will proceed with Mr. Cresanti, the nominee to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.;N
I ask that question because just a week ago, the President, as you noted, made a statement citing the importance of competitiveness in technology, and we must have investment.;N
I think nanotechnology could potentially be a huge development in history and in America's economy, and we could put ourselves in a position of really becoming the dominant player in the world in nanotechnology.;N
It may be--it may develop into something that may be a little bit more like the--say, the genetically modified organisms, where, in many parts of the world, in many markets, that's very controversial, and there's very low consumer confidence in those things, et cetera.;N
So--and a lot of suspicion about those things--but in the nanotechnology world, one thing I've noticed is that, really, it is a world that is being developed right now by small businesses.;N
And I guess I'd just ask you, do you have any plans to bolster the public trust in nanotechnology and also help these small businesses develop these amazing technologies and try to implement those and get those into the marketplace?;N
As soon as possible, we'll have a markup, and we hope to soon be able to call you ``Under Secretary.'';N
If I might interject, Mr. Chairman, our Governor signed that legislation, I believe, in the last day or two, so--I mean, just very recently.;N
But I would like to submit, if I may, a few questions for your consideration, somewhat technical.;N
But I just want to tell Mr. Sanborn, when I arrived in the Washington, in the U.S. Senate, if my recollection is correct, American bottoms carried 85 percent of all the cargo containers in the seven seas.;N
That's an area I spent a good portion of my career, particularly since I've been in the Senate, working on aviation issues, surface transportation, safety.;N
"My own State had not passed a primary seatbelt law, because, as I said on the floor of the Senate, if you tell us what we must do or we'll be punished, we will not do it; but if you tell us that we'll get a reward if we act responsibly, we probably will do it.";N
But also, of course, worked on the--as I said, the highway bill and aviation, for Amtrak, freight.;N
We're a very mobile society, and we want modern means of technology, modern means of transportation.;N
You need to be advocates not just for the position that you're in and to us, you need to be advocates within the Administration, too.;N
"I think, overall, it's a pretty good budget, but I think transportation, you know, is barely holding its own; and, only that, because of highway bill, I guess, marginally up a little bit, and yet we're finding other places to spend money that don't mean nearly as much, in terms of the economy and jobs, creation of jobs.";N
The three of us, even the gentleman from--the Senator from Arkansas, are particularly interested in maritime.;N
And I would predict, right now, the day will come where we're going to regret our neglect over the last 50 years in our--of our maritime industry, across the board.;N
And, with your background, you've got the potential, I think, to be--become a spokesman and a thinker.;D
In Washington, all we've done lately is to complain about the past and try to blame somebody.;N
What are we going to do in the future to make sure that the crisis looming before us in maritime does not occur?;N
And if you have to wind up in the Oval Office convincing the President, we will escort you.;N
Added to Government Affairs, like Mr.--like our chairman, you know, I hope you will--you know, you work a two-way street, and don't just occasionally give us a call to--;N
And, of course, we know him, and we've worked with him, we've served with him, we like him.;N
But, you know, sometimes our message needs to get through to him, and, more importantly, from him to the White House.;N
I've learned that quite often these Government Affairs people and positions don't work for their Department.;N
So, if you're going to be in that position, if that is, in fact, a place you'll have an impact, I hope you'll be aggressive for the transportation point of view.;N
I do take a particular interest in who goes into these positions, and I'm counting on really good, strong leadership from all of you.;D
Should we strengthen our requirements for things like rollover, ejection mitigation, roof crush, impact projection?;N
And the other--a week ago, tonight, President Bush said--I believe the phrase he used is, ``America is addicted to oil,'' or petroleum.;N
I know that there have been some innovations with engine design to make them more energy efficient, et cetera, which is great.;N
And, Mr. Duvall, let me ask you, if I can turn my attention to you, I was reviewing the President's FY07 budget, the one that Senator Lott likes so much----;N
Their largest industry has pretty much said that one of the reasons they are there is because they can fly their salespeople out, and they can fly customers in.;N
And they've pretty much said, if they lose that essential air service status, they may move.;N
And so, essential air service is not just a convenience for casual flyers, it's very important to business, very important to our economy.;N
I'd like to get your thoughts on the fact that this budget cuts funding for essential air service about in half.;N
One last question on that is--or on a slightly different subject--is, there's a--there have been two significant rulemakings that deal with truck driver hours of service--I don't know if you've followed that at all--and driver training requirements that have been, actually, thrown out of Federal court.;N
And, as I understand it, I think it's a fair statement to say that one of the reasons they are--they have been thrown out of court, I should say--is because the agency did not follow Congressional intent.;N
Well, Mr. Duvall, it so happens that essential air service started in Alaska at the time we brought about deregulation of the CAB, Civil Aeronautics Board.;N
Last week, I heard there's one village that has been canceled out of essential air service, which means it's absolutely stranded up there on the tundra.;N
Now, I hope you mean what you said, that you're going to look at it and put some priority behind the rural aspects of essential air service.;D
I'm sure it has acceptance elsewhere in the country, but, very clearly, a State like mine, where air transportation is the only means of transportation, it ought not to be abandoned.;N
Let me state--it's obvious to all of you--you're going to serve with a gentleman that we all consider to be, you know, sort of a gift of God to the Government, that's Secretary Mineta.;D
We've worked with him in the Congress, we've worked with him in the Department and other jobs.;D
He's a native of Tucson, Arizona, who, as you know, has been nominated to be Commandant of the Coast Guard.;D
I note that this is somewhat ironic, since the largest body of water in the Admiral's hometown is the University of Arizona's swimming pool.;N
Mr. Chairman, Admiral Allen has dedicated himself to public service, having served in the U.S. Coast Guard since his graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.;D
Presently, as you know, he's serving as Chief of Staff to the Commandant, and all of us, all Americans, I think, are familiar with his recent work as the principal Federal official overseeing the government's recovery efforts in response to Hurricane Katrina.;D
His leadership style and commitment to the people affected by the disaster have been roundly applauded.;D
He led the Atlantic Forces in the Coast Guard's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th.;D
I believe these experiences will guide Admiral Allen as he leads the Coast Guard in securing our ports and protecting our waterways.;D
And, finally, Mr. Chairman, in addition to an undergraduate degree from the Coast Guard Academy, an institution some might say he foolishly chose over an appointment to the Naval Academy, Admiral Allen holds a Master of Public Administration degree from The George Washington University, and a Master of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.;D
I intend to aggregate the policy guidance that's been contained in the Homeland Security Act, the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and the recent National Strategy for Maritime Security into a Coast Guard Maritime Strategy that will serve as a blueprint for legislative, regulatory, and budgetary recommendations.;N
The nature of the maritime domain requires an integrated, layered approach to security, and the Coast Guard strategy will support that approach.;N
And our day-to-day mission execution will be guided by the principles of operation that have evolved over two centuries of Coast Guard operations.;N
The exercise of these principles by our ship captains, pilots, air crews, and boat crews was never more evident than in our response to Hurricane Katrina.;N
And I, also, relied on these principles in the execution of my duties as the principal Federal official.;N
We are nothing without our people, and our people cannot be effective without the right tools.;N
On the capabilities side, the Coast Guard has embarked on a comprehensive recapitalization of our cutters, aircraft, sensor architecture through the Integrated Deepwater System.;N
Delivery of these assets to relieve aging ships, aircraft, and systems is essential to our force's near-term readiness and long-term effectiveness.;N
Extensive effort has been expended to adjust this program to meet new post-9/11 requirements and address gaps arising from the increased operations tempo required to meet current threats.;N
I am personally committed to executing this program in the most effective manner possible.;N
My focus will be on program management, effective cost control, integrated logistics support, and platform effectiveness.;N
I am also convinced, based on my experiences in the Gulf Coast hurricanes, that we can better exploit the unique operational capabilities inherent in our deployable Coast Guard units, including our marine safety and security teams, port security teams, and strike teams.;N
By grouping these capabilities into tailored force packages under a unified chain of command, we can sharpen our own toolkit for maritime disasters and threat response.;N
If confirmed, my first step will be to align Coast Guard deployable forces internally, and then seek opportunities to integrate these forces with other DHS and Federal capabilities.;N
We must provide Coast Guard personnel the skills, knowledge, and competencies needed to effectively contribute to mission execution, and, at the same time, for their individual growth, career development, and lifelong learning.;N
Identification of core competencies needed to operate and maintain new boats, cutters, aircraft, and sensors must be accelerated to complete--and be completed to allow delivery of new platforms at full operational capability.;N
And, finally, initiatives to improve law enforcement competencies, language proficiency, and officer specialty management must continually become institutionalized in our resource system.;N
My final priority is to build a Coast Guard organizational structure that supports field operations and ensures mission execution.;N
Every element of our services not involved in mission execution must be aimed at field support, and we must be internally aligned with DHS support systems.;N
Based on the new sector mission delivery system and the new requirements for deployable forces, I will conduct a comprehensive review of existing command and control structures and logistics and maintenance systems to ensure that the Coast Guard is optimally organized to support field operations.;N
The Coast Guard's current finance, maintenance, and logistics systems are based on platforms, such as aircraft and cutters, not on common functions or processes.;N
This situation, as well as future requirements, require that the Coast Guard develop and deploy an integrated transformational business architecture that aligns with DHS and, above all, facilitates more effective mission execution.;N
I'd like to make a final comment about partnerships and leveraging Coast Guard competencies within the Department of Homeland Security and the government.;N
I believe that the Coast Guard is well positioned and uniquely equipped to contribute to the growing relationship between the Department of Homeland Security, the Departments of Defense and Justice, and the Director of National Intelligence.;N
In particular, the recent issuance of a revised Navy/Coast Guard National Fleet Policy by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant focuses on our shared world of work and the best combined use of our respective capabilities and competencies in support of the National Strategy for Maritime Security.;N
What do you think about the direction we're going, as far as the Deepwater projects that we believe we should be pursuing?;N
We seem to be upgrading the projects, the existing legacy assets, rather than going into Deepwater.;N
I am committed to doing that and making sure those legacy assets get the job done, but getting those new assets online as quickly as we can, sir.;N
What is going to be the policy about the access to the icebreakers for our state and the Pacific Northwest?;N
Well, sir, I think there's been a dramatic change in the landscape of icebreaking capability and requirements in the last couple of years.;N
As you know, there was an accommodation made last year to shift funding in the National Science Foundation, to actually bring the money back to the Coast Guard to support our operations.;N
I think, with the growing concern over the shrinking of the Arctic icecap, the continuing issues with resupply of McMurdo Sound and the South Pole, and the condition of the icebreakers, I think a national public policy discussion is in order to take a more holistic view of where we need to go, and where we need to go with all three of the icebreakers, not just the two Polar Class and the Healy, sir.;N
Well, I can't ask you for comment, but I intend to try and reverse that decision that was made last year.;N
The National Science Foundation is also under the jurisdiction of this Committee, but it doesn't have a constant need for icebreakers.;N
It does, in terms of its scientific expeditions at the North and South Poles, but there's still a need for our Nation to have access to icebreakers, particularly those of us who live in the area I live in, in Alaska.;N
Have you looked into that problem, of how we're going to maintain the security of the maritime boundaries in the future?;N
As you know, our commitment right now is to have one cutter on the major boundary line--maritime boundary line, and one in the Bering Sea.;N
Our challenge is, as we decommission the older ships and bring the new ones online, to not break that commitment and keep that presence up there.;N
That's one reason why we are intending to relocate one of our high-endurance cutters to Kodiak, to replace the--Coast Guard Cutter Storrs will be decommissioned, sir.;N
Vice Admiral Allen has a distinguished background, and--look forward to supporting the nomination, look forward to a robust Coast Guard presence in North Dakota in the future.;D
Well, between operating that swimming pool in Phoenix and this thing in North Dakota, if you get around to it, send another icebreaker up our way, will you?;N
I want to applaud Admiral Allen for all that he has done on behalf of the Coast Guard, and all that he will do in the future, in his new position as Commandant of the Coast Guard.;D
He has demonstrated his exemplary performance in righting the response to Hurricane Katrina, with his critical role that he played in New Orleans and throughout the Gulf region during that very difficult and devastating time.;D
And I look forward to working with you, Admiral Allen, on so many of the key issues that are confronting the Coast Guard that demonstrated its superb professionalism and dedication and heroism in its response to Hurricane Katrina when it saved more than 33,000 lives.;D
I hope that we will be able to work with you in providing the resources that the Coast Guard rightly deserves, with the Deepwater recapitalization--I hope that we can expedite that timetable--and also to provide you with the interoperability, the command and control, that one Deepwater asset that was in the Gulf at the time was able to provide.;N
The Coast Guard, otherwise, is without it, but made do with what you didn't have, which, again, shows the remarkable dimension of the skills and professionalism of the Coast Guard.;D
And, obviously, I think the issue of port security is one of the preeminent concerns, and probably will be the most critical challenge of your tenure.;N
And I look forward to working through some of these issues to ensure that you have the resources to do all that's going to be essential to provide for our homeland defense and security.;N
Fifteen Cuban rafters were clinging to a bridge in the Florida Keys, thinking that they had reached land.;N
"The Coast Guard rounded them up and sent them back to Cuba, under the legal reasoning that since this was the old bridge, the new bridge having been built right beside it, that the old bridge wasn't actually connected to the land; and, therefore, they had not reached the land side of America.";N
We do not have an opinion from the Department of Justice yet, but I understand it's under review.;N
What was the legal reasoning that you came to that you would consider, under the wet foot/dry foot policy, that they had not reached America?;N
Well, first of all, Senator, let me just state that I was not at Coast Guard Headquarters when that occurred.;N
I am a former Seventh District Commander in Miami, and I've been involved in those missions before.;N
But a legal determination was made by our legal staff, and communicated down to the Commander of the Seventh Coast Guard District, who I believe you've already met with, that assimilated that bridge to being the same as something that was not connected to land.;N
And that was a decision that was made on scene at the time that resulted in the migrants being repatriated, sir.;N
And the reason I say that is, there are a lot of structures down there that are not connected to land, and, notwithstanding that that bridge had formerly been connected to land, we have migrants that are deposited on all forms of structures out there, some of which are very, very unsafe.;N
And, as a general rule down there, anything that's not connected to land is not considered to be ``dry feet,'' but there's a safety aspect to this, too, in the precarious position that some of these migrants have been placed in by smugglers.;N
And so, it's entirely--if the law is as stated by this Federal judge, that they were illegally sent back to Cuba--in other words, that they were legally in the United States--they don't have much recourse now.;N
As I said, if there is a different policy guidance that comes out from the current adjudication that's underway, we will take our cue from that.;N
We try not to make policy at the deck plates, but we will respond to whatever outcome of the judicial process that occurs.;N
Well, let me ask you, are you familiar with the process, when you pick up a rafter at sea and you do an investigation on the Coast Guard boat to determine if there is the fear of political persecution if returned, and you make that determination--you, the Coast Guard, make that determination--before you would bring them to the immigration authorities in the United States?;N
They're interviewed by an asylum prescreening officer that's provided to us by USCIS, and the determination on their status is made as a result of those interviews and interagency consultation.;N
So, in the case of a fellow named de Valle, who was picked up in 2002 and was repatriated to Cuba and promptly thrown into jail, that was a determination made by the immigration department, not by the Coast Guard?;N
There is an interagency discussion between all the respective Departments that have play in that, from a policy standpoint.;N
Guidance then is provided back down to the operational commanders on scene, on whether or not the individual will be repatriated or possibly placed to Guantanamo Bay to potentially go to a third country.;N
I was aware that there was an inquiry made today, and I believe we're still looking for information with USCIS on that.;N
I don't have any current information, but we'd be glad to give you that information after the hearing, sir, once it's developed.;N
Well, since you're going to be the Commandant, these are going to be very poignant and pointed issues that are going to have to be addressed----;N
Senator Bill Nelson.--so that we don't get into this kind of situation, where someone is thrown back into the jaws of a dictator--that, in fact, has reason to believe that they are going to be politically persecuted.;N
And my commitment to you is, we'll do it with transparency in the light of the day with the people we serve, sir.;N
Listening to the questioning from Senator Nelson, the Coast Guard, these days, Mr. Chairman, has--it's probably more important than in its entire history of so many centuries in this country.;N
Additionally, you have to worry about stowaways and figuring out--you find out that some ship that's just leaving someplace hundreds of miles away has a stowaway, and you're positioning all that.;N
I've visited the Coast Guard Headquarters in Norfolk, and it's amazing what you all have to do.;N
And so diverse, so multifaceted--of course, worrying about hurricanes and storms and rescues, and then the refugee issue, as well.;N
And I think our policy, insofar as those who are escaping for freedom from Castro's regime, is a policy that doesn't make a great deal of sense.;N
It is not, though, in my view, the role of Admiral Allen to change that policy or ignore the policy or not follow the law.;N
It is incumbent on us, as Members of Congress, and, in fact, the President and the Administration.;N
And so, I don't know if we'd have enough votes to do it, but I think that that policy needs to be reviewed, as far as our standing strong for freedom, justice, and not ask an admiral to look the other way, ignore the laws.;N
You've brought the most credibility and discipline and structure and analysis to that chaos, from those of us watching all around the world.;N
But I think--I just think it's a bit unfair to ask him to do that, when we ought to try to do it.;N
I know our colleague, Senator Martinez, is well aware of this, and has a very personal interest.;D
But thank you for bringing the issue, but I don't--I think you've put him in an untenable position to say, ``Well, that's the law, but try to find a way of administering it differently.'';N
If the Senator would notice, the Admiral has answered the question with regard to the Coast Guard decision of the repatriating of the 15 rafters in early January.;N
He has stated that was a Coast Guard decision, after consultation with their legal counsel.;N
Now that that issue has been brought to full fruition in a Federal court, where the court has said that the law was not followed, it's certainly worth bringing up that issue, on those kind of interpretations within the Coast Guard itself.;N
Our next nominee is Robert McDowell, nominee to be a Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, to be introduced by Senator Allen.;N
And they're raising them on what's left of the farm that--in Northern Virginia where Rob grew up.;N
I'm delighted that President Bush has nominated Rob to serve as Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.;N
Rob brings with him approximately 16 years of private sector experience in the communications industry.;D
I think that experience alone makes him a tremendous asset to the Commission, from the perspective that he has had.;D
When I was serving as Governor of Virginia, I actually appointed Rob to not one, but two different boards and commissions, one dealing with combating drugs in Virginia, and the other as a consumer perspective on the Board of Contractors.;D
And he spent, really, the last three decades serving his Commonwealth, his community, in a variety of different civic and charitable ways.;D
He went to Duke University in undergraduate school, went to law school at the College of William and Mary, where Mr. Jefferson--Thomas Jefferson studied law.;D
He has served as outside counsel to numerous technology and telecom companies and trade associations.;D
He's admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the Supreme Court of Virginia, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the First Circuit, Fourth Circuit, and Fifth Circuit, and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia--a very competent lawyer.;D
And I think he's going to execute his duties as Commissioner with great ethics, with objectivity, and the utmost of professionalism.;D
And I think he'll be striving in these--and you'll read his statement, and you'll hear it--but I think he'll be striving to make sure that all people in this country have the opportunity to benefit from the digital revolution.;D
I think he'll be a devoted and a very pragmatic commissioner in the finest and fairest caliber with his knowledge and his experience.;D
And I'm speaking for myself, but I know I'm also speaking on behalf of my colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, Congressman Tom Davis, Congressman Wolf, and other members of the Virginia delegation, in enthusiastically supporting the confirmation of President Bush's nomination of Rob McDowell on the Federal Communications Commission.;N
And, if I could, may I ask the first question of the witness, Mr. Chairman, because I'm supposed to have left 10 minutes ago?;N
But if I could ask a question, the first question, if you would--leave of court, if it please the court----;N
I didn't--my statement--all the experience you've had in the last 16 years, you have been an advocate for telecom entrepreneurs, for technology entrepreneurs.;N
And you may have more experience than any other of the commissioners, as well, in these areas.;N
But I do think it's fair to ask you how you think you'll be able to adjudicate matters objectively and fairly, given your background.;D
I did want to--I didn't want to have to leave at 4 o'clock without saying that I support Robert McDowell's nomination.;N
I think the President has sent us a nomination that is a solid nomination of someone well qualified.;D
Mr. Chairman, I think this Commission now, with a full complement of commissioners, will be making decisions that will have a profound impact on what the American people see, hear, and read in the coming years, because they're going to be confronted with this issue of ownership limits.;D
And there's not much more important, in my judgment, in our government than getting this right.;N
The Commission has sunk its teeth into it before, been thwarted by the courts, and thwarted by the Congress.;N
I'm not going to ask you specific questions about it, because we had a long talk in my office about that.;N
But concentration in ownership of the media, including television, radio, and the proposals for cross-ownership with newspapers, it's a very serious issue, because it will have a significant impact on what people in this democracy can see, hear, and read, what information they get.;N
And the foundation for democratic self-government is basic information of the American people.;N
And I'm really especially pleased we're finally going to have an FCC with all five members seated, present, and willing to debate and vote on issues.;N
Senator Smith was not able to be here, but he sent a question and asked me to put it to you.;N
His question is this, ``For those of us in Oregon who have been trying to attract a baseball team for years, we're envious of the fans in cities that actually have a team.;N
I am, however, becoming more concerned about a tactic that cable companies are using to limit viewership of local sports programming.;N
Then Comcast did the same thing in Philadelphia with the Phillies, and in Washington, D.C. with the Nationals.'';N
``I understand that business negotiations can be tough, but blocking game broadcasts has raised real concerns.;N
We have a hearing this morning on nominations from the President for the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and the nominee for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.;N
We welcome all of you and thank you for coming, and thank the nominees for their willingness to serve.;D
Kevin Martin is currently serving as Chairman of the FCC, and has been with the agency since 2001.;D
Prior to joining the FCC, Mr. Martin served as a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, as well as an advisor to FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth.;D
It is a good morning, and it's my pleasure to introduce the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and my friend, Kevin Martin.;N
I want to take this opportunity--and I will be brief--to strongly recommend that you confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC.;N
As the FCC Commissioner, Kevin's consistently served as an ambassador on behalf of the Commission at a time of great change and uncertainty in the world of telecommunications.;D
He has a unique ability to bring together diverse groups, be they urban or rural or of opposing philosophies, and to forge consensus on complex issues.;D
I've always found his door, as well as his mind, to be open to all who have had issues and concerns before the Commission.;N
Throughout his tenure at the FCC, Kevin has had the best interest of the Commission at heart.;D
And although our policy views have differed at times, he's always been thoughtful and diplomatic at exploring these differences.;D
Kevin's vision of the industry he currently regulates, and his attention to details, make him eminently qualified and the best person to lead the Commission and help move this industry forward in the 21st century.;D
Hailing from my home State of North Carolina, I'm proud to call Kevin Martin a fellow North Carolinian, and also a friend.;D
I trust, Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, that all the members of this committee will confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC as expeditiously as we can.;N
I thank the Chair, and I thank the Committee for their attention to what I believe is absolutely one of the most crucial sectors of our economy, and that's telecommunications, and the rules and the legislation that it takes for that to flourish in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead.;N
I guess I just need to say this directly--I don't think that we've had a real concentration on communications policy in this Administration.;N
We've fallen much farther behind Europe and Asia in the next-generation broadband deployment.;N
I know that many in the industry say that they're doing all that they can, but I, frankly, would disagree.;N
I think access to broadband communications has to be a matter for rural areas, as well as for urban areas.;N
But a full 25 percent of my constituents in West Virginia have absolutely no access to any form of broadband.;N
I think that Japan is now producing over 90 percent of the world's fiberoptic broadband deployment.;N
I appreciate the opportunity for the hearing--this is an important position--and certainly appreciate the introduction of Senator Burr, and would agree with Senator Burr that Chairman Martin, among the nominees that we're going to be hearing from today, is amicable, is thoughtful, and has tried to lead the Commission to the best of his ability.;D
My concern, though, and the questions that I have today, have to do with policy and what kind of policies we're going to pursue, what kind of vision and leadership we're going to have at the FCC, given the current dynamic environment in telecommunications and Internet policy today.;N
But, without a doubt, he has pursued policies to restrict marketing of Internet services in an age where those Internet voice services are growing and providing new opportunities for customers today.;D
And all the while, I think it's fair to say, the Commission has failed to address some of the enormous inequities we see in the universal service system today.;N
And this committee has had hearing after hearing about those problems, about the contribution factor, about weaknesses in distribution, about limitations in access in rural areas.;N
And I think many of those problems fall on the shoulders of a Universal Service Fund that is failing to meet the valuable objective for which it was established.;N
We have access charges of 10, 12, and 14 cents a minute, in parts of the country, that make no economic sense whatsoever.;N
So, I do think these are significant problems in the policy direction that's been established for the FCC.;N
They're issues that I've been outspoken on, but I think others in the House and Senate have raised them, as well.;N
And these policies are particularly problematic in an environment where we have enormous growth in services, choices, options for customers, and new entrants.;N
As a result, it's particularly problematic when the FCC seeks to protect existing business models or enforce specific business models on the industry.;N
But I think it's good, from a consumer standpoint, that we have such a proliferation of services and choices on the Internet, choices and--channels and new products and new content being provided by satellite and by cable and by DSL.;N
And it's a mistake to look at what we've had in the way of market structure in the past, or rules or regulations in the past, and say we automatically need to enforce these business models on any future competitors.;N
There's a great deal of power vested in the FCC, and I think that that power needs to be used very judiciously.;N
And I would hope that, in the comments and the responses we hear from the Chairman, it's made clear that in a dynamic environment we ought to exercise the utmost restraint in imposing new regulations that will adversely affect the competitive structure.;N
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding hearings on these two very important nominations.;N
And I hear his daughter is communicating very freely or--is that your daughter or--OK, your son.;N
And now, more than ever, Americans rely upon various forms of communications to enrich their lives and to conduct their daily business.;N
Whether watching TV or making a call or accessing the Internet, consumers rely on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services.;N
Consumers are counting on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services.;N
Currently, there are a number of communications and media issues before the FCC that are of particular interest to the public.;N
These include the FCC's media ownership proceeding, reports that companies are turning customer phone records over to the Federal Government without a warrant, and net neutrality.;N
I'm deeply concerned that a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow.;N
I am deeply concerned that a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow.;N
These media giants already use multiple media outlets to promote their views and dominate public debate.;N
Americans have made it clear that a diversity of viewpoints and localism are extremely important to them, and I hope the Commission listens.;N
On August the 10th, I sent Chairman Martin a letter urging him to conduct a public hearing in California regarding its recently released media ownership Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.;N
I'm very pleased that the Commission just announced that its very first field hearing will be held in Los Angeles on October the 3rd.;N
And, having said that, I hope the Commission will now pay attention to the public at these field hearings.;N
It's also vital that the FCC aggressively protect the privacy rights and reasonable expectations of consumers.;N
Reports that telephone companies are handing customer information over to the government without a warrant are very troubling, and I hope that the Commission will examine any allegations of such activity.;N
As the head of the FCC, Chairman Martin is in a unique position to influence the Commission's activities.;N
I have a number of questions regarding these issues and other issues, and look forward to hearing his answers.;N
He's been nominated to head the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency less known to the general public.;N
But as a result of the Deficit Reduction Act, the NTIA has been charged with a number of new and important projects, including the establishment of a $1 billion program to promote interoperable communications, something I think we all agree has to happen, and the establishment of a program to distribute analog-to-;N
So, I'm very interested in hearing from Mr. Kneuer about NTIA's progress on implementing these important programs.;N
I am very interested in a lot of what you've been involved with, but I want to mention one thing, particularly, today, very quickly, if I can skip around in my statement.;N
I have been working on, along with a number of members of this committee for the last year, an emergency alert upgrade system called the WARN Act.;N
It has passed the Committee here, and, with the help of Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye, Ben Nelson, and others on this committee, it is headed for the floor today to be added to the port security bill.;N
And my concern, at this point, is, the FCC has proceeded with rulemaking on an emergency alert system, similar to the WARN Act, which would set up a mandatory structure which we believe would diminish the potential of a new emergency alert system using wireless technology all across the country.;N
In a number of hearings and meetings with the wireless networks across the country, the potential of competition for the best system is clearly there.;N
And my fear is, if the FCC moves ahead with its own mandates, that we'll end up with another government top-down, one-size-fits-all system that does not use the innovative possibilities that we have.;N
As many of you know who have worked on this bill, the ability, in the event of a terrorist attack or a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, to use wireless technologies to not only be warned of a possible disaster, but to use NOAA information of wind directions and other available information to tell people which way to evacuate, where food and shelter is, a lot of other information that we've seen in Katrina and other problems, that is not currently available.;N
I believe that if this Federal Government sets up the infrastructure to provide these signals and warnings, that our free-market economy can create the best delivery systems that the world has ever seen.;N
And my request today, as we have done to your folks already, is to delay this rulemaking until we see what Congress finishes here before the end of the year, so that we can capture the will of the Congress instead of a mandate of the FCC.;N
And, again, I look forward to your confirmation, but would request, I think, as others have today, that we let the free market work and use government mandates only as the last resort.;N
As Senator DeMint has just said, his amendment is pending on the floor at 10:30, and I will have to leave at that time.;N
And I want to take the prerogative of the Chair to turn this over to Senator Burns in just a minute.;N
If I may, I'd just like to ask a couple of questions before I go manage the bill on the floor.;N
Do you think you have any existing authority to take action if a problem develops before this bill becomes law?;N
In our bill, we develop a new concept for universal service and eliminate the concept that only long-;N
You have discussed a reverse auction concept whereby rural telephone companies, wireless companies, and other competitors would compete for the right to use the Universal Service Fund's support.;N
Well, by definition, an entity with a fixed system, embedded system, having a wireless competitor would always lose.;N
If you put it on a competitive basis, I don't see how existing technology can possibly survive against new technology, so you automatically have a revolving door, as far as Universal Service is concerned.;N
But if a small rural carrier in a small community that's met the needs of that community for years is facing a national company that comes in and wants just to replace it completely with a wireless system, and do that nationally, the larger company has got enormous advantage over the local provider.;N
I would hope you really take a look at the concept of continuity and, really, community presence, because the absentee owner, once they get the ability to serve, they have no further interest in that community, as the local provider who started the system, does.;N
And I really think that it's going to be a system whereby the existing local providers are just going to be wiped off the map.;N
And Google Video and YouTube video services, should the FCC have the power to regulate those?;N
You mentioned universal service and your desire to make some changes with regard to both distribution and revenue collection, but the FCC keeps raising the contribution factor.;N
We're over 10 percent now, 10 percent Universal Service fee on consumers' use of communications.;N
Senator Sununu.--and is provided to all parts of the country, suburban as well as rural and high-cost areas.;N
And I would simply make a point I've made before, is that you suggest you want to be restrictive so that the objectives of this fund are directed--or the money in the funds are directed--toward the key objectives of high-cost areas and rural areas.;N
There's a tremendous amount of money that remains in the hands of districts that don't necessarily fit that description.;N
And I know there are a lot of technical factors that go into determining how you assess contribution requirements for Universal Service, but the contribution factor for IP voice providers is approximately 65 percent, and the contribution factor for wireless providers is 37 percent.;N
I'll stipulate both of these are very arbitrary numbers, but it seems extremely disproportionate, and even punitive, to assign a contribution factor of 65 percent to one, and 37 percent to another, when I think it's fair to argue that the overall mix of the kinds of communications that are taking place are quite similar.;N
I respect the fact that you're trying to make a decision based on data, but it is spurious to make such an important and significant financial decision based on one datapoint.;N
And I think it runs against common sense to assume that the percentage of interstate communication taking place under IP services is twice that taking place under wireless services.;N
I will agree they might not be equal, but a factor of two to one, I think, really does defy common sense.;N
Chairman Martin and Mr. Kneuer, I don't have questions for you, and I apologize, but I'm going to vote for you.;N
It's my understanding you're going to be issuing an order, before too long, with regard to a West Virginia company----;N
We've been working--you've been working with OMB, we've been working together, to try and craft a letter on the Antideficiency Act--;N
and that's a very perilous Act--in which case the result of the Act is the opposite of what is intended in the case of the Universal Service Fund.;N
But I think it has to be said that the OMB appears to be reasonably openly hostile to the Universal Service Fund, and, as is, unfortunate, to the E-Rate program.;N
As you know--and Senator Stevens has left--and he's been very helpful to us on this question of the appropriation's 1-;N
"I have been trying for, I don't know, 10, 12 years, through a crude mechanism called a tax credit--I, along with a whole lot of other people; in fact, I think 75 Members of the Senate--to get broadband deployment done through a tax credit.";N
And I'm unhappy to report to you that it hasn't worked in any single one of those 10 or 12 years.;N
So, do you think that the Universal Service Fund has, in its range, the possibility of support for broadband infrastructure?;N
Do you have the authority to make it a supported service, or is that something that has to come from the Congress?;N
I think you have substantial qualifications, and I'm pleased that you offer yourself for service.;D
Today's monthly trade deficit announcement was $68 billion in a month, highest in history.;N
We are engaged in a trade strategy that is fundamentally faulty and is going to be very damaging to this country.;N
And I know that being involved in the Commerce Department, you will hear people in the Commerce Department marching around and talking about how wonderful this trade strategy is.;N
But I just wanted to make the point that we've had a pretty devastating announcement this morning about a $68-;N
But, Chairman Martin, you were part of a troika in the FCC that said it was OK to create new ownership rules so that in one major city one company--one company--could own eight radio stations, three television stations, the newspaper, and the local cable company, and that would be just fine, no problem at all.;N
I mean, you're now beginning a new ownership rulemaking process, but do you still feel comfortable suggesting that in one major American city it's fine for one company to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the cable company, the dominant newspaper?;N
Chairman Martin, do you think there's been substantial increased concentration in virtually every area of the media?;N
Right now, the media conglomerates--about six of them, essentially: Viacom, Disney, Time Warner, News Corp, CBS, and NBC/General Electric--control the big-four networks, 70 percent of the prime-time television market share, most cable channels, as well as vast holdings in radio, publishing, movie studios, music, Internet, other sectors.;N
"And whenever somebody talks to me about the--all of the Internet opportunities and so on--I've talked before about many voices, one ventriloquist; you can cite many voices, one ventriloquist.";N
Would you agree with me that we have seen very substantial concentration in almost every area of the media in recent years?;N
Do you believe that increased concentration, in most cases, will likely be moving against the issue of localism, and that localism--with respect to broadcasting and the use of the airwaves that belong to all of the American people--localism is essential and central to the notion of what broadcasting is about?;N
It's--in fact, Chairman Powell started it, and then just dropped it, it just sat there, and nothing happened.;N
It would make much more sense to complete the proceedings on owner--on localism, rather, before you decide on ownership, wouldn't it?;N
Since the Chairman started talking about net neutrality in his first question to you, I want to--when the FCC decided that broadband should be removed from Title II of the Telecommunications Act, and said it is no longer a telephone service, but an information service, that took from it, then, the attachment to nondiscrimination.;N
"Nondiscrimination rules applied, up until that point, to all that was described as a telephone service; nondiscrimination rules no longer applied once it was taken out of that definition.";N
And when the FCC made its decision, then the nondiscrimination rules that did attach at that point did not continue to attach.;N
Would you agree that the television advertisements that ran during our markup, this committee's markup, on the issue of net neutrality--the television commercials that ran, that indicated that the principles that you have established included nondiscrimination principles--that those television commercials were inaccurate?;N
Chairman Martin, you and the Commission will make some of the most important decisions that will be made, in terms of the development of information in this country.;N
And it seems to me, further concentration in the media, having fewer and fewer people determine what we see, hear, and read in this country, is antithetical to everything we should believe in that fosters and nurtures democracy.;N
And I hope as you and the other commissioners sift through these, you will keep that in mind.;N
And I hope as you have six hearings around the country, the first of which will be in Los Angeles, you will hold one in a rural state, a rural area, as well, to allow us to weigh in on these things.;N
And let me finish with at least one bone here, and that is, your predecessor held only one hearing and then moved ahead.;N
Some of us will want to hold you up even more, to the extent we can, to slow you down and hope you reach the right conclusion.;N
I mentioned the WARN Act in my statement, the emergency alert system that we've been working on here in Congress, and obviously the FCC has an interest in that and has begun the rulemaking process.;N
Our request is that you--as you stated in your statement, as you mentioned, the will of Congress should be expressed sometime in November.;N
And, we believe, before the end of this year, we will have expressed the will of Congress.;N
On the content side, do you believe a content provider, such as Google, should have the right to charge its customers more for prime placement on its pages than those who don't have prime placement?;N
Do you think a network provider, such as Verizon, should have the freedom to charge more for higher requirements, such as video, from its customers?;N
So, you think network providers, if they are offering higher-speed options and different types of products, that they can price those differently.;N
And I think, as you know, what you just said is opposed to the concept of network neutrality.;N
And I was happy to see that you had pulled from the agenda the vote on additional must-carry privileges.;N
As we move toward creating more cable competition, more video options in the marketplace, obviously we think it--at least a number of us do--think this is not the time to go in and mandate that our retailers of video services are required to carry different options by their customers, when we think that's going to happen naturally.;N
But is it fair to say--do you intend to bring multicast must-carry up for a vote again at the Commission?;N
And, by the way, I have questions for both of you, so I'm going to stay a second round if my time runs out.;N
When the FCC released its media ownership decision in 2003, Congress and the courts criticized the Commission for serious problems.;N
In then-Chairman Powell's words, quote, ``In the months that followed, we heard the voice of public concern about the media loud and clear.;N
You said, Mr. Martin, ``What local broadcasters provide in terms of local news and information to the community is really important.'';N
Now, in August 2003, the FCC established a Localism Task Force to study issues like the impact of media consolidation on local news programming.;N
It is now 3 years later, and we haven't seen a release of any report or any policy recommendations from the staff.;N
I mean, I'm very happy with what you're going to do, but I think there's work that's been done, and it's been stifled.;N
But I have a copy of a draft report, dated June 17, 2004, ``Do Local Owners Deliver More Localism?;N
Well, I'm going to ask you to please go back, after you look at it again--I'm going to ask the--all the other commissioners to tell me if they ever saw this report, because, according to it, ``Local ownership''--this is a quote--``adds almost 5 and one-half minutes of local news and over 3 minutes of local on-location news.;N
In the course of a year, this means locally owned stations provide over 33 more hours of regional news, news that's directly relevant and important to viewers.'';N
I mean, this is important information about issues that are key to the people--I would suspect, your own mom, who lives in rural America.;N
"You know, it seems to me--and maybe I'm just a cynic; I've been here a long time--that, you know, this comes out with a very clear response to the question of consolidation versus localism.";N
But I'm sure glad somebody out there sent this to me, because I think this is news, that this kind of work has never seen the light of day.;N
They went out, and they did a real good study of this, and they found out that there's more local news.;N
Our team seems to be falling apart, so, you know, our batting order's going to pick up here a little bit.;N
And Chairman Martin, thank you for your interest in always trying to reach out and work with me in various capacities.;N
Let me follow up on one of Senator Sununu's questions of a few moments ago on the Internet.;N
Let me get to a more specific question about the Internet, and that's decency on the Internet.;N
Do you think that we, as in the Congress or the FCC or the folks that are--the Internet industry, so to speak--do you think we should try to make the Internet a more decent place?;N
I know there's been a media campaign through the Ad Council, et cetera, about parental controls on televisions, and using cable and satellite, et cetera.;N
What's your assessment of that public relations campaign and the effectiveness of it, as it stands today?;N
The Committee's heard a lot of discussion about the Texas video franchising law, and I'd like to get--as a Federal regulator, I'd like to get your impressions of the Texas video franchising, about--has it increased consumer choice?;N
Chairman Stevens, a few moments ago, mentioned that net neutrality has been a very sticky wicket for this Committee and for the telecommunications bill.;N
And I think it's one of the major holdups on getting telecommunications done this year on the Senate floor.;N
Personally, I like the FCC's approach, where you define two or three--I guess, three different items.;N
Given your experience on the FCC in net neutrality, how has--from your perspective, how has the FCC approach worked, so far?;N
And I've--I got to watch those babies go back and forth, and I said, ``Welcome to the Senate Daycare Center.'';N
"I've got an important press conference--has to do with agriculture; and so, I take my agriculture pretty serious--and I'm going to submit my questions, but I want Mrs. Boxer to ask her--she's got a couple of more questions.";N
But I want to give you an idea of what I'll be asking, and I want you to respond both to the Committee and to me.;N
Well, we'll get back to you on that, because the decisions I know basically say that, you know, you could proceed.;N
But I feel like Mr. Kneuer has been left out of this, and he has a very important job, because he will be establishing a $1-billion public-safety interoperability grant program, and a lot of us, in a bipartisan way, are concerned that our first responders can't talk to each other.;D
So, how soon after October 1st will the NTIA be prepared to distribute grants to public-safety entities, Mr. Kneuer?;N
So, how soon--I hate to cut you off, but I'm running out of time--how soon can we see these grants being distributed to public-safety entities?;N
that we have to prepare for an attack, that our law enforcement has to talk to each other.;N
So, will you please write to me within the next week or so and give me the projected date that you will be ready to hand out these grants?;N
Mr. Kneuer, I'm going to--I have a couple of questions for Chairman Martin, and it has to do with the VoIP 911 order and subsequent filings and this type thing.;N
Senator Hutchison has submitted a statement for the record in support of your nomination, Mr. Chealander, and it will be included in the record.;N
That will be the policy of the Committee, unless we hear from the Committee Members through their staffs that there is any objection to any of those.;N
We will also do our best to get your two nominations discharged so that we can consider them before we adjourn.;N
It's with great pleasure, Mr. Chairman, I introduce to the Committee Mary Peters, who has been nominated, as you well know, as the 15th Secretary of the Department of Transportation.;N
And, of course, all of us are familiar with Mary through her nearly 4 years of service as the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration from 2001 to 2005.;D
She's a fourth-generation Arizonan, was the director of the Arizona Department of Transportation, known as ADOT, prior to taking the helm of the Highway Administration.;D
She gained nearly 16 years of firsthand transportation agency experience during her service at the Arizona Department of Transportation, and another 4 years at the Federal Highway Administration.;D
I appreciate very much the President of the United States selecting such an outstanding and capable individual to fill this important leadership position.;D
And I would like very much that this committee approve, or consider and then approve, her nomination as quickly as possible, as I think it would be good for the country to have her on the job before we go out for recess.;N
Mr. Chairman, first let me agree with my colleague Senator McCain that it would be very much in the best interests of this country if the nomination of Mary Peters could move forward very expeditiously, first through the Committee and then on to the floor of the Senate.;N
My colleague, of course, traced the career of Mary Peters, a distinguished career focused on transportation issues.;N
When she was here in Washington as the head of the Federal Highway Administration at DOT, among other things she led efforts to improve the safety and security of our country's highways and bridges, reduce congestion, and institutionalize better fiscal oversight and accountability.;D
And she distinguished herself in the same way when she headed the Department of Transportation in the State of Arizona.;D
But, for my place, I couldn't recommend more strongly someone who has all of the attributes, not just the skills and the experience, but the personal qualities to be a part of the President's Cabinet, to be advising him, to working with Members of Congress.;D
And so, when, once again, she agreed to answer the President's call to leave the warm and sunny weather of Arizona to come back to Washington, I applauded her choice, and I urge the Committee to act quickly so that she can begin her responsibilities here as soon as possible, serving the people of this country.;D
She's a person of great integrity and charisma, and I'm very proud to call her a friend and commend her to the Committee.;D
I would suggest that the nominee present her statement, then we'll go around and give Senators an opportunity to question the nominee.;N
Senator Lott.--being nominated by the President to this very important position as Secretary of Transportation.;N
Mr. Chairman, I've had occasion in the past to work with the nominee when she was at the Federal Highway Administration, and I found it to be a very satisfactory relationship, and we actually produced a result, and it led to a completion of a project that had been in the mill for 40 years.;D
I don't want to ask a lot of questions now, because a lot of the questions I would ask you would be in areas that you may not have been involved in in the past.;N
But let me just say that, as I told the nominee when I met with her, I think transportation is a critical part of our society and our economy.;N
I think it's the best department in the government, in terms of actually creating jobs and doing things for people.;N
But I just believe that we need to have an agenda, a plan, and we need to be forward-leaning when it comes to transportation and how we build our roads and bridges, and doing more in the aviation area.;N
We have an air traffic control system that is just not up to the standards that we're going to have to have.;N
We have had improvements in railroads, the short lines and the big freight lines, but we need even more.;N
Do we want it to be able to provide good service, on-time service, you know, with input from the states and the passengers, or not?;N
Now, I can just say that in Congress we're going to provide initiatives in all these areas.;N
As a member of the Finance Committee, we have a tax incentive proposal to greatly encourage the freight railroads to expand their capacity.;N
So, as our new Secretary of Transportation, I challenge you to get hold of this issue and get us moving forward.;N
And I think you're going to have to speak to the White House and OMB a little bit, because they're not going to want to spend some of the money.;N
But there is never a better dollar spent, other than for defense, than the money we spend on lanes, planes, trains, ports, and harbors.;N
Just a couple of specific questions with regard to your appointment to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission.;N
and it involves a conversion on my own part--is my concern about safety in all of these areas--in trains, in planes, and also in the highways.;N
And instead of trying to punish them or threaten them or beat them into submission, we gave them incentives, that if you pass the comprehensive seatbelt laws, you'll get a little extra money.;N
And my state, which is always recalcitrant on being told by the Federal Government what we have to do, within 6 months did it.;N
And we've seen, already, an improvement in our statistics with regard to seatbelt use by people involved in accidents.;N
We also have asked your department, the appropriate department, to look at some other safety proposals to see how it might work with regard to child safety and some of the rearview activities and how kids accidentally can knock cars out of park and have them roll forward and kill children.;N
So, I hope that you will also take a look at some of these safety initiatives that are being considered.;N
I don't advocate doing them just for appearance's sake, but if we can do some things that would help in that area, I think it would be a very good thing for you to focus on.;N
I think she has very substantial experience directly in these areas, so I think this is a good nomination.;D
And I would also join my colleague Senator McCain in suggesting that it would make sense for us to move quickly on this nomination.;N
I think having vacancies in these top positions in agencies is a hindrance, and I would hope we would move quickly on it.;N
We have, in western North Dakota and eastern Montana, particularly in the Williston area, an Essential Air Service contract connecting Williston and Dickinson, to Denver, and that contract--they had attempted to have a third flight a day when it was reauthorized a few years ago.;N
Since that time, there has been substantial activity in the oil patch, and our region has increased ridership over 23 percent in one city, and 12 percent in another.;N
And I want to work with you and visit with you about that, because we need to connect that increasing activity in the oil patch to the hub in Denver with better EAS service.;N
I also want to mention, on Amtrak, if I can, the Empire Builder, which runs from--it affects a number of us on this committee--it runs from Chicago to Seattle.;N
The previous Secretary, Norm Mineta, whom you succeeded, once said, ``Trains that nobody wants to ride''--he was talking about long-distance trains, and used the Empire Builder as an example--``Trains that nobody wants to ride.'';N
And obviously Secretary Mineta didn't know what he was talking about, hadn't done his research.;N
Zeroing out Amtrak funding or coming in with a proposal that would essentially eliminate all long-distance trains is not the way I think the majority on this committee believes we should approach this.;N
And then, Senator Inouye has been very active--and I have joined him--on this issue of a rulemaking with respect to foreign control of U.S. airlines.;N
I talked to you about a radar issue at--in our state, as well, at the Bismarck Commerce Center.;N
But, having said all of that, I--you know, Mr. Chairman, we have a lot of nominees that come to the Congress who are marginally qualified--I shouldn't say ``a lot,'' but a number of times someone's friend is nominated.;N
You have a depth of experience, I think, in transportation issues that's very, very important.;D
I do want to mention one additional thing, and that is the issue of surface transportation, the STB, with respect to railroads.;N
Again, my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, and myself, have worked long and hard on the issue of captive shippers.;N
And to say that the STB does nothing is to give them much greater credit than they deserve.;N
It's an unbelievably inept agency that--I mean, glaciers move more rapidly than the STB on very serious issues that they are confronted with.;N
So, those of us on this committee, on a bipartisan basis, who push and try to cajole and force the actions on some of the important things for captive shippers, who are really, literally held captive and are paying a massive amount of extra money--our Public Service Commission estimates that North Dakotans are overcharged by $100 million--$100 million a year.;N
And, again, on a bipartisan basis, Members of this committee would very much like some action.;N
That falls under your jurisdiction, at some point here, and we hope to be able to visit and work with you on all of these things.;N
I wanted to at least alert you to those issues of interest from the standpoint of one rural state, North Dakota.;N
And I look forward to working with you, and I will look forward to seeing that--if we can get this nomination to the Senate as expeditiously as possible.;N
I would say, Ms. Peters, that if we're going to have a vote on you after our next vote, that your situation doesn't sound exactly dire to me.;N
But the thing that struck me most about you is your openness, your--the sense of transparency about you, and that you, kind of, look for the right solutions, and you're willing to stand by them, and you're plainspoken in the way you do it.;D
That drives most of our colleagues on this committee crazy, but it ought to drive all of them, I think, in the direction of trying to solve this, and it's a very--it's a very simple thing.;N
Staggers, who is a West Virginian--that Staggers Deregulation Act of 1984, everybody got deregulated if there were two lines going into a business, but the 20 percent who weren't didn't get deregulated.;N
And that's--when he was referring to the STB--ICC, before that--there's never been any movement on that.;N
And the railroads always have inadequate revenues, and then, as you're discussing that, you open up their annual reports, and the revenues are overflowing in all directions.;N
If his are 100 million, that means, probably, ours are more, because there are so many chemicals and coal and timber that comes out of our state--car parts, all kinds of things.;N
And I think it's just a question of a Cabinet officer, sort of, grappling with that issue.;N
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison isn't here today, but, you know, Houston was just in a mess--or parts of Texas were in a mess when a certain situation happened down there.;N
I met with the head of one of the big railroads this morning, and he seemed very open, accommodating in his attitude.;N
It isn't good enough to, sort of, take an individual industry which is having a problem and then make an accommodation to them, because that slides past the real problem.;N
I would also mention the safety of motorists and pedestrians who--at rural rail crossings.;N
And it's a--it's not just you, it's the DHS, Coast Guard, TSA, the Corps of Engineers, all kinds of other folks, local also, and the behavior of people.;N
And I won't ask for an answer right now, but I would actually appreciate if you would, maybe, send me a letter giving me some of your thoughts on what we do about that, because the costs involved and the safety involved--like you mentioned, the child with the seatbelt--well, this is, sort of, Americans with a seatbelt for a period of a number of yards.;N
Another issue that I would just bring up is the--something that we face very much in West Virginia, where we have--only 4 percent of West Virginia is flat.;N
And so, that means that when you have as many chemicals as we do, up and down the Ohio, and then into the interior and the Kanawha River, so, it was really the foundation state for chemicals--and so, there's the question of, what do you do when there's an incident, whether it's a terrorist attack or whether it's just a car that overturns?;N
I am ranking on the Aviation Subcommittee here, and we've seen that the aviation industry has been turned upside-down, as you very well know.;N
And its budget--the FAA's budget for dealing with these things--the Congress has consistently rejected cuts to airport construction funding.;N
And I want you to be sensitive to--you know, we've had all kinds of things that have been taken from our budget, but some of these things affect Americans every single day.;N
And, with that, I'd just say that if you would think about those, respond to me on the rail-crossing thing, and to say that I'm going to very proudly vote for you.;N
We've got our regional jets now, not big--not as big as airports, but making more frequent flights.;N
And general aviation--how general aviation is treated, it will play, I think, an even larger role in the years to come.;N
And if decisions are made in the Department of Transportation, in the FAA, or wherever, we've got to make sure that the big and the small are considered, and to be at the table.;N
And as we talked about--in surface transportation, I think we're going to be facing great challenges in the terms of capacity constraints in our network.;N
The next 20 years, freight shipments are expected to dramatically increase, placing serious demands on roads, aviation, rail, and waterways.;N
My particular concern, as you know, relates to the role of what freight rates--or the freight railways play in our nation's infrastructure.;N
But most of those limitations are a symptom of a much larger problem, the lack of meaningful competition for rates and service in many parts of our country, especially Montana, and I think Senator Dorgan alluded to that for North Dakota a little while ago.;N
We've got to remember, the other day, the Surface Transportation Board issued some rules on trying to deal with small shippers, that they may have a place to obtain, but it's anything under $200,000.;N
But one has to remember that it is in the law now, in Section 10101, in Title 49 of the U.S. Code-- ``...it is the policy of the United States Government to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail.'';N
But there's also another line to that, ``to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition.'';N
And--because it's being reflected not only in our grain that we ship from the State of Montana to our ports, but the energy, the coal we ship from our--from ours that goes into--that goes into electricity.;N
And we have to deal--now, we have to deal with it in the context of what's good for the railroad, too, because we cannot operate without good rail service.;N
And so, we have to find some way--some way that the small and the large can survive, and along with our railroads, even our short lines and how we handle that.;N
And there are certain things that we can do, and we should do in the near future, in order to address those problems and still take care of the infrastructure that they need to improve their capacity to move freight by surface transportation.;N
Amtrak, I will tell you, I want you to move some folks down to the Department of Transportation.;N
And everybody says there's no--there's nobody who rides those trains across--the Empire Builder.;N
So, those are the areas that I think--and I look forward in working with you in all of these challenges.;N
She has actually been to South Carolina to work on some innovative transportation solutions.;D
I think we all know that the federal Department of Transportation can do only so much, and I think it was the thought of considering taking some of the road responsibilities back to local and state governments while we look at national infrastructure for rail and what we're going to do with aviation may make sense at this time--and she seems willing to look at some innovative ideas.;N
And I join my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, in looking forward to voting affirmatively for your confirmation.;N
As we spoke in my office about a range of issues from planes, trains, and automobiles, you've got a huge job.;N
There are now reports coming out that the Highway Trust Fund will be out of money by, or short of money by 2008.;N
We previously spoke of the I-5 Columbia River corridor that connects the States of Washington and Oregon, and the congestion is so bad there that by 2 in the afternoon it's a parking lot, and yet, it is a vital link for commerce and transportation in our country.;N
So, obviously, I'm anxious to work with you and to learn of any ideas you have to help us to alleviate the congestion on our highways and how we're going to finance it.;D
On the Finance Committee we recently implemented a tax credit for the railroads to invest in rails, and we find, in the operation of that tax credit, that much of it was nullified by the AMT.;N
The IRS is now coming out with a ruling further restricting it, and, therefore, frustrating the very unanimous--or near unanimous intent of Congress.;N
Anything you can do to help us come up with ideas for how we can obtain more investment in rails, both cross-country and short line, would be appreciated.;N
It is critical to relieve congestion on our highways and to increase efficiency in our transportation means.;N
It looks like you have made a lot of friends in your private discussions, and I, sort of, feel the same way, but I've got a couple of questions to ask.;N
The fact of the matter is that, while we can't do much about the destruction that we get from extreme weather and other conditions beyond our control, we can do things to provide transportation.;N
And I'd like to know that you're going to tackle all the problems that exist for every mode of transportation.;N
You certainly have experience on the highway side of things, but future transportation needs of our country will not be met by highways alone.;D
And, you know, I'm very concerned about Amtrak, and listen with interest as other Senators from other parts of the country beside the Northeast have shown today a serious interest in seeing that Amtrak continues to operate and appropriate investments are being made to bring it up to date.;N
But the budgets tell us the true story, that in a single year we spend more on highways than we've spent on Amtrak improvement over the last 35 years.;N
Right now we're trying to find room in our national airspace for all the flights that we have--by reducing separations and limiting flights at certain airports.;N
At Newark, for instance, Federal Aviation Administrator Blakey has said we need 35 controllers for safe operations, but we're 15 percent short.;N
It goes back a few years, but it is about the safety concerns with heavier, longer trucks.;N
You wrote ``rollovers and jack-knifings by trucks already''--this was, again 7 years ago--``already a problem on our interstates and our highways.;N
In addition to safety consequences, we're reminded about the effect of additional weights on our highway facilities, especially bridges.'';N
And so, we've discussed shortages in FAA controllers, the search for more capacity in the airspace, on the freight rail lines, and dealing with the congestion and pollution that we now get from jammed highways.;N
Senator Lott and I have a bill that's sponsored by many of our friends here to get Amtrak the Federal funding that would permit it to operate without having to go out there with a tin cup every time they need something.;N
So, I'm hoping, Ms. Peters, that you will join us in that quest to make sure that Amtrak gets the investment that it needs to bring our country's passenger railroad up to date.;N
I'd--if there are plans, I'd be curious about what statutory authority there is to do that.;N
I'd say this, that--and I look forward to working with you on this, but I would say this, that if DOT is planning on moving forward, the kinds of things I would want to know is, what legal authority is there?;N
And then I would want to know, is there some sort of agreement with Mexico to allow U.S. safety inspectors and auditors to look at the trucks?;N
Would they have to pay all the same fees, the various registration, fuel taxes, those kind of things?;N
Would they have to do the international registration plan, the IRP, and the internal fuel tax agreement?;N
Would they have to comply with all the same rules and regs that the U.S. carriers would have to?;N
So, as you look at that, I would very much appreciate having a dialogue with your Department and those agencies as that is being developed.;N
And the other thing I wanted to touch on, something you and I talked about several days ago, is the real infrastructure needs that we have in this country.;N
In some of my reading, I read where you said that we can't depend on the Federal Government to bring the money in, that it was around--that was around when the interstate system was first built.;N
When you say, ``We can't depend on the Federal Government to have that same kind of money when the interstate system was first built,'' what does that mean?;N
That sounds like toll roads, to me, but I'm curious to hear your response on how you think the Federal Government will--or we, as a Nation--will pay for these transportation needs that we have.;N
And you certainly come with, you know, the highest level of commendation with respect to your past accomplishments and experience, so I'm very pleased that you'll become the next Secretary of Transportation because of your breadth of expertise in the areas that are going to be so critical to the future.;D
I know some of my other colleagues on the Committee have already referenced it, and I'm very pleased as well that we had the opportunity to meet recently on some of the issues that I consider to be critical, certainly to my State of Maine, as also to, I think, the national transportation policy.;N
But obviously as we look to the future, one of the concerns that I had, and I've expressed, is making sure that, you know, rural states like Maine are not forgotten in the overall transportation policy.;N
First of all, as I mentioned to you about Amtrak--and we were fortunate to be one of the last states to have the benefit of an extension of Amtrak from Boston to Portland, and it's extremely successful, has a 92-percent, you know, customer satisfaction rate, because of the outstanding services provided to the people of Maine and the vicinity.;N
It's worked exceedingly well, so much so that we're looking to extend it even further up into the State.;N
And one of the reasons for its success, as I mentioned to you, was the Federal waiver that was granted to the State to use the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds for that purpose, and that will expire in 2009.;N
Can you state for this committee what your views are with respect to the use--the flexibility using Federal transportation funds for this purpose?;N
Because that certainly has contributed to the success for the Downeaster, the extension of Amtrak to Maine, and certainly will in the future, and if--particularly if we want to extend that service even further up because it's so heavily utilized by the people in New England, in my state.;N
You know, I happen to believe in--and I gather you share that belief, as well--that it is essential that the Federal Government play a role in creating a strong national rail system.;N
It is absolutely essential that we have one, and one that--obviously, that's going to provide--that's going to have the benefit of Federal support.;N
You know, hopefully we can move, you know, further and further away from, you know, huge Federal subsidies.;N
But, nevertheless, I think it's so vital and central to our overall transportation policy.;N
Second, on aviation, rural aviation--and, again, I know my colleagues have raised this issue, but I do think it is paramount--and that is, of course, regional airports, such as those that exist in Maine, or Essential Air Service communities that depend upon the Essential Air Service, you know, funding.;N
And one, of course, is the fact that--first, referring to the operational evaluation plan--it seems that much of the focus in the past of--by these plans--and certainly the most recent, focused on the large hub airports--understandably so, because of the congestion that exists at these hub airports.;N
But, on the other hand, what concerns me is what is occurring in, you know, my state with the small regional airports, is that we're, you know, losing--a loss of seats and overall--both in terms of flights and seats in passenger service--there's no question that our airports have been very hard hit over the years, and yet it's pivotal and central to economic development.;N
So, I would like to get your views--one, in terms of examining, you know, how you incorporate, you know, regional airports and those that serve the rural states of this country, in the overall plans for the future.;N
And I hope you will give that consideration, since they play a premier role in the development of our economies, as does the Essential Air Service program that--you know, Maine is one of the--other than four other states, we're the largest beneficiaries of that program.;N
I'm also concerned about the Administration's proposed, you know, community cost-sharing between the Federal Government--in some cases as much as 80/20.;N
It's something that we have rejected in the past, and certainly, hopefully, will do so in the future, because I think that places an inordinate burden on those communities that depend on the EAS program.;N
But in--it's obvious it's going to have a paramount impact on them if they have to--if they have to provide for the cost-sharing and they see a reduction in the overall program, which--the Administration has submitted, you know, a program and a budget for that, for less than, I think, half of what exists today.;N
And the matter of foreign ownership of our airlines, ownership and control, that's a matter of great concern to me, and to many of us.;N
And I'd be wary and resistant to the notion that we might turn over--let control be taken by foreign owners.;N
But do you intend to--if you're confirmed, to pursue changes in the rules on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines?;N
You're aware of the fact that there is a strong interest, in our region, to open up another rail tunnel under the Hudson River---- ;N
Senator Lautenberg.--so that we can increase the capacity to allow enough trains to go through there.;N
And I'd like to know that you will at least consider seriously the requests for help from you to make sure that we get going with that project.;N
That's a project of national interest, even though the tunnel is between New York and New Jersey, because right now it is the biggest bottleneck on the entire Northeast Corridor from here to Boston.;N
And so, can I have an indication of the fact that you're--that you understand the need for this tunnel and will be helpful to us as we pursue a way to get it done?;N
Now, I don't want to ask any questions that might be interpreted as being on the personal side, but you're a motorcycle rider, are you not?;N
The helmet that I was wearing was 2 days old, and I've been skiing 60 years, and it virtually saved my life.;N
We do have a fairly bipartisan approach to many issues, particularly in transportation here in this committee.;N
I look forward to working with you, along with our Co-Chairman and members on both sides of the aisle.;N
Today my oldest son Christopher came to Washington with family including one of his colleagues from a high school he just graduated from last week.;N
During the course of lunch and the time on the Hill, they met a lot of our Senators who've seen my boys grow up over the years through our Christmas cards and everyone remarked how big he's gotten to be, and he's tall, he's like 17 years old and he's taller than his dad and I think a whole lot smarter, too.;N
They marvel at how quickly these children grow up--is this the little boy that I remember that was born when you were in the House of Representatives?;N
Today, I'm privileged to introduce the son of one of our colleagues, Joe Biden, who's here today along with his wife, Jill to support Hunter Biden.;N
Hunter Biden is a native Delawarian and I would go on to say that he's also been nominated to serve on the Amtrak Board of Directors.;N
When Hunter was unable to get into the University of Delaware, he instead went on to Georgetown and then to Yale Law School and managed to get through those OK.;N
He's ended up being Senior Vice President at MBNA one of the largest financial institutions in the country.;N
He served as Executive Director of Economy Policy Coordination at the U.S. Department of Commerce.;D
About 5 years ago he went off and formed a law firm here in Washington, D.C., and now they represent over 100 clients including a bunch of non-profit organizations and educational institutions.;D
More specifically, though, and for our purposes and for the purpose of this nomination, Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains.;D
Like his father, like our Congressman, Mike Castle and myself, Hunter Biden has lived in Delaware while using Amtrak to commute to his job as we commute to our job in Washington almost every day of the week.;D
You know, you learn a lot about what could work and what would work better at Amtrak by riding trains and talking to the passengers, the commuters, the passengers, the folks who work on the trains and make them work every day.;N
You also have a chance to see the huge economic benefit the region receives from having a strong passenger rail corridor, something that should be available in a lot of other parts of our country.;N
The second reason I am pleased to see this nomination move forward is I believe it shows a beginning to move back toward a bipartisan direction at least with respect to this particular board.;N
The Amtrak Board has traditionally had both Democratic and Republican members, but for the past several years, it has been partisan and it has been incomplete.;N
Last November, my colleagues recall that 93 members of the Senate, supported Amtrak reauthorization, legislation introduced by Senator Lautenberg, co-sponsored by myself, and I know many Members of this Committee.;N
Passenger rail, like highways and airports, is not a partisan issue and shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's a mode of travel that we believe is gaining popularity in a time when commuters are being pinched by high gas prices and frustrated with highway and airport congestion.;N
Finally, as we confirm a full, bipartisan Board at Amtrak, that Board will be more able to take on the difficult issues that face Amtrak, from tackling long-deferred maintenance, modernizing the system nationwide and addressing demand for new and expanded service across the country on already stretched freight tracks.;N
A full bipartisan Board that has been duly confirmed by this Senate will have the credibility needed to take on these challenges and move Amtrak and our country into the 21st century.;N
And while we are tackling these challenges, it will be comforting for the millions of Amtrak riders and commuters to know that one of their own, Hunter Biden, will be on the Board of Directors.;N
And, if I could just say it's a point of personal privilege, I have been privileged to have lived in Delaware since 1973, since I got out of the Navy, and Joe Biden was one of the first people I met when I arrived there.;N
He and Jill have raised two boys and a girl that any of us would be proud to call our own and I am.;N
It's deeply a privilege to sit here today before them and before you to be able to offer him as our candidate from Delaware to serve on this board.;N
Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for this opportunity to congratulate all of the nominees that have been selected to serve in positions that are very critical to our transportation system.;N
Of course, when someone says that to you, and you've been around here long enough to know better, they'll usually say something pleasant before the rest comes.;N
I just wanted to raise a question--and I don't want to pick on anybody in particular, Mr. Chairman--but let me start with Mr. Hill's thoughts on several issues.;N
I'd like to hear about them, regarding, as a result of the job that he has held, the size and weight of trucks, particularly since Secretary Mineta commented last week that he'd consider expanding the use of triple trailer vehicles.;N
And I would hope that the Nation's top truck safety advocate wouldn't be advocating a change that might include some new safety risks on the road.;N
In terms of my interest, as you know very well, Mr. Chairman, I think everybody pretty much does when it comes to Amtrak, I'm glad to see that we're going to be filling two of these posts and look forward to having a chance to chat with them.;N
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your ever dutiful response to issues that we're concerned about and this hearing is one of them.;N
Thank you very much, so what we intend to do is to go through each member and as you're introduced and we hear from you, we hope that you will start off by introducing your parents and family with you, some famous some infamous and some you don't want to introduce anyway, but do it, well, do it.;N
That means that we're starting with Hunter Biden and Donna McLean, who have been nominated to the Amtrak Reform Board and will serve for 5 years if confirmed.;N
It is a controversial subject of discussion for this Committee, and I'm sure that you'll have some questions as we go forward.;N
Senator Carper has introduced you, Mr. Biden and Senator Lugar has sent a statement in support of Ms. McLean.;N
I've known you longer than you've been alive, Hunter, so if you want to introduce your family, and I think you can ignore your dad, I think we know him.;N
Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman, I think aviation to Alaska compares very much to rail for New Jersey.;N
We probably have more flights per square acre, if one can measure that, than any state in the country.;N
We have four significant airports starting with Newark, the biggest, Atlantic City International, Morristown Airport, and Teterboro Airport that are largely used for general aviation and industry.;N
I'm very much concerned about Amtrak and I would say that the focus on reform that the Chairman raised here, may be interpreted differently by different folks.;N
That could be a final ``improvement'' that would result in the railroad not existing anymore.;N
Hunter--I would call you Mr. Biden, but I'd be afraid your father would stand up--so I'm going to call you Hunter, and besides we've known each other such a long time--I'm pleased to see you here and with the understanding that you have so well, of what Amtrak means to states like Delaware and then we go on to New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, you name it, in the most densely populated area of the country.;N
So, when I look at reform and I look at the ``improvements'' that could be made, I see that we have yet to make the investment in Amtrak.;N
Investments have not really been sufficient to get a first class railroad in our country, and we fail to do that at our peril.;N
No one ever believed that would be possible, but it was that day and Amtrak was the only way to carry people from Washington.;N
The train brought up several Congressmen and Senators from Washington to New York to see what had happened that tragic day when New Jersey lost some 700 people and New York almost 2,000.;N
It was a change in America, one that we never dreamed would happen, but has left a nightmarish impact on us ever since then.;N
And so, I question whether or not the Amtrak Reform Board is there to see that Amtrak ``improves'' its service to the country or whether or not it is there to further whittle away at Amtrak's ability to operate.;N
You know we have capital expenses, we have debt service, we have operating expenses, all of those things, and so, whatever one we choke off, could again be the death knell for Amtrak.;N
We know that there is an attitude, a preponderant attitude I'd say within the Administration, that Amtrak is not a necessary part of our transportation system.;N
So once again, I hope that you had a chance, as I encouraged the other day, to look at the numbers and see what they represent.;N
Mr. Chairman, if Amtrak didn't operate, just in the corridor, the northeast corridor, we'd need more than 10,000 flights a year to substitute for the passenger trafficking that Amtrak presently covers and everyone knows that there's not a better expert in the Senate on aviation than Senator Stevens.;N
I have a nexus in aviation personnel as well and we're going to be looking at the introduction of some 5,000 very light jets in the next 10 years.;N
The sky is infinite and as a consequence, we have to deal with it the best way we can, including a strong Amtrak.;N
Turning to Mr. Steinberg, the FAA announced on Monday that it's going to unilaterally impose a new contract on some 15,000 air traffic controllers.;N
This contract covers a wide range of unresolved bargaining issues and in court you argued that the FAA could impose new conditions regarding pay and benefits, but not terms about working conditions.;N
Now was it your advice to FAA that Federal law allows FAA to impose this change in working conditions as well?;N
So you think that the court gave you that latitude to make the decision that went beyond pay and benefits in its interpretation of laws going back to 1996, did you say?;N
But, Mr. Steinberg, in all fairness, here, you are an attorney, a skilled attorney, but I don't think it reflects well upon you to make an argument in court--;D
It was an appeals court that decided this and they ruled in your favor after listening to your arguments.;N
So if there's an interpretation that you think can go beyond the pay and benefits issue, then I think it constitutes an interpretation that's unnecessarily broad.;N
Your action in this air traffic controller case created a lot of unnecessary work for the Congress.;N
Just so we can plan ahead, are there any other laws that you anticipate re-interpreting if you're confirmed for this position?;N
But you didn't accept the plain language of the law requiring submission to include the union's objections and reasons for the objections.;N
I like your commitment that you review this situation with us directly if confirmed, I'd appreciate that.;N
OK, Mr. Hill, Secretary Mineta said that he'd be amenable to the increased use of triple trailer trucks.;N
Now, that's something that's of grave concern to me because of the known safety risks with these trucks.;N
I don't know whether you'd like to have your family riding in front of, along side of, or behind one of those triple trailer trucks on our roads, but I would say this, I've fought very hard to limit triple-truck use to 16 states, where it now is possible, there are all kinds of films and evidence that suggest that triple-trailer trucks present a heightened safety risk and can cause significant damage on roads not specifically prepared to handle them.;N
You had a direct role in developing the hours of service regulations that were overturned by the United States Court of Appeals in 2004.;N
Even though the court required the FMC to re-examine and overhaul the regulation, I'm concerned that the rule that was adopted in 2005 was almost functionally identical as the original rule and jeopardized the safety of truck drivers and all motorists on the highways.;N
Yes, we've had some terrible, terrible truck accidents as a result of sleepy drivers and I was thinking, Mr. Chairman, that they have a deadman's throttle in trains, but at least you know if the train continues, that it's going to be exactly where it's supposed to be.;N
Can we somehow or other, get some instrumentation in the cab that would alert the driver or alert some recipient of the fact that this driver is beyond being able to function properly?;N
I said that this would be the last question, but I meant that it was next to the last, Mr. Chairman.;N
I'm concerned that under this Administration, the agency FMC has not been effective enough when it comes to improving truck safety and if confirmed, what steps might you take to reduce the over 5,000 large truck-related deaths each year?;N
Senators Allen and Warner and Congressman Davis are here to introduce Sean Connaughton and Charles Nottingham.;N
I have been notified that many nominees have their family and friends here today, and I hope the nominees will take the time to introduce them.;N
When I was on this committee we used to use a natural voice, but now we have all kinds of things.;N
Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment for a brief moment to welcome Senator Warner of course, all of the colleagues who will come.;N
I intend to support all of these nominees and thank them to be willing to serve their country.;N
I did not want to miss the moment, however, for the nominee to be Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board.;N
We have as you know, Mr. Chairman, we have for a long, long while have been suffering through these issues of rail rates in this country.;N
We desperately need an aggressive Surface Transportation Board that will stand up for shippers and do the right thing.;N
I hope that he and I will engage often and see if we can get the Surface Transportation Board stand up for the consumers and the rail shippers of this country.;D
But again, I will support all of these nominees, and I think the Administration has given us some good folks to consider for these important decisions.;N
I know you are to support a nominee, but we will proceed with him if that is all right with you?;N
I am currently chairing the Armed Services Committee, and we have a hearing with General Conway before us to be the next Commandant of the Marine Corps.;N
I think one of the fastest growing counties in America, not just the United States, but America.;N
I have worked with him through the years, and he will do an excellent job as a public servant, both of these men.;D
So with that, Mr. Chairman, and I ask indulgence to my good friends who I've come to speak for, actually it is better that I say less, and you say more.;N
I am especially pleased to introduce to the Committee, Mr. Robert Sumwalt of Columbia, South Carolina, as a nominee to serve on the National Transportation Safety Board.;N
I also, I think Mr. Chairman, you have already recognized Robert's wife, Anne, his daughter, Mackenzie, who are here to support his nomination today.;N
When you meet Robert the first thing that comes through is his passion for transportation safety.;D
I am here to speak on behalf of and introduce Admiral Jay Cohen, the President's nominee to be Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology.;N
Admiral Cohen graduated from the Naval Academy and received a Master's degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.;D
He is a 35-year veteran of the Navy, most recently serving as the Chief of Naval Research.;D
In that role, he has championed many significant programs for the Marines and the Navy, including some that I have been personally involved in and watched him professionally undertake.;D
I got to know the Admiral through two important projects that we have worked on together over the years.;N
One is called the Magdalena Ridge Observatory, kind of a ``break the mold'' observatory approach on the top of a mountain with a different structure for observatories.;N
The Expeditionary Unit Water Purification Program has had much success in the past few years.;N
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici in introducing Admiral Jay Cohen.;N
He has an extraordinarily distinguished career in the United States Navy, and let me emphasize as Senator Domenici did, his service of 5\1/2\ years as the Chief of Naval Research.;D
There he was responsible and effective in managing complicated technology projects, delivering new technology and new innovation to the fleet and with those skills, he will be superbly prepared to assume his new responsibilities in the Department of Homeland Security.;D
He also understands very well the need to develop and maintain an industrial base that will support the technology efforts of the Department, and that industrial base is not just the facilities, but also the designers and the engineers that are so critical to maintaining our progress and continuing our leadership in so many different roles.;D
As Senator Domenici pointed out, Admiral Cohen is a graduate of the Naval Academy, and I was reluctant to come here today until he informed me that the Navy football team lost all 4 years while he was at Navy.;D
Congressman Davis has worked at the local government level and has worked with both of these gentlemen.;D
Particularly, understanding Sean Connaughton's work, and I thank Congressman Davis for coming over here for them.;D
The third one by the way, Robert Sumwalt, I've actually had the pleasure of meeting him with Senator DeMint, and I'm sure he'll extol his virtues, but I endorse his nomination as well.;D
As far as Sean Connaughton to be Administrator of the MARAD and Chip Nottingham to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board, both of these are long time Virginians with an exceptional records of service to the people of the Commonwealth.;D
Sean Connaughton has done an absolutely superb job as Chairman of the Prince William Country Board of Supervisors.;D
He has balanced the needs that the fighting and disputes that the country has over growth and where the growth should be.;D
I was there about a month ago dedicating a 9/11 memorial for those who perished on 9/11 from Prince William County, and what Sean has really shown is he is a man sticking to principles, well-;D
grounded, but also working with all parties to achieve positive goals for the people of a very diverse, large and growing county.;D
In addition to that, being a graduate of not just of George Mason's law school, but a graduate of the U.S. Naval War College.;D
He's results-oriented, can-do, get things done, and Sean Connaughton, I have no question in my mind would be exceptional in this position.;D
On Chip Nottingham, Chip served in Virginia, the Commonwealth Transportation Board, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Transportation, a tough, but a very important job.;D
He is also one who looks for innovative, creative ways of expanding the transportation pie.;D
One of the key Administration successes I had when I was Governor was what is called a Private Transportation Act, and Chip Nottingham tested and expanded and utilized the approach, and I think that's the sort of creative leadership we need at the national level, and Chip Nottingham is a person again with a proven record of performance, a person who has the right principles.;N
He solves problems and that's the sort of person we need on the Surface Transportation Board, and I recommend both of these gentlemen with all my highest recommendations and look forward to their confirmation.;D
I'd just like to say I am pleased that the adopted son of Hawaii, Admiral Cohen, is one of the nominees, and I am certain that he will continue service to our Nation with great distinction.;N
"I do, Chairman Stevens, and I am so pleased to introduce my wife Nancy, her mother, Lee Noll, a World War II Navy Nurse; and Eleanor Rickover who we consider part of our family.";N
She is Admiral Rickover's widow, a career Navy Nurse, also Admiral Rickover who both of you, and many on the Committee knew so well, taught us all to change the world and taught us the value of standards.;N
in-law, Sarah and Don Clements, and the future generation Hailey Clements and if we can get her to Hawaii, I think Senator she will compete very well for Miss Hawaii.;N
It certainly brings back memories for Senator Inouye and I and we're particularly pleased to see you here ladies, thank you for joining us.;N
You may not have been nominated to be Cabinet Secretaries yet, but you are all nominated for very important assignments.;N
I am familiar with the background of several of you, and I think you are really a well-qualified group.;D
We did have occasion to seek his assistance with some of our issues there along the Gulf Coast.;D
I am very concerned about Maritime Administration and the strength of our maritime industry.;N
I want to make sure the Administration understands and appreciates the need for the Jones Act, and so I'm counting on you Mr. Connaughton, to work with us to make sure we do the right thing for the maritime industry.;N
And also, Mr. Nottingham, let me just say that I have a lot of interest in surface transportation and railroads.;N
We have an opportunity here to improve service, expand capacity, better serve the economy, and prepare for the future.;N
I certainly will support your nominations and I hope we can move them before the August recess.;N
One was an airplane that I barely missed getting on and it crashed, and with many of my friends on board and I was briefed on what happened to that airplane.;N
The second was when I survived the crash and five people including my wife were killed and they came and told me what had happened.;N
And the third was when the Alaska Airlines coming out of Mexico went into an inverted spin and crashed carrying a whole series of people that I had grown up with.;N
Your Board has more contact I think with the people than you realize, and we all when we are exposed to circumstances like that want to know what happened.;N
"I'm sure you know that the recent reduction in our accident rate in Alaska has been dramatic; brought about by the Medallion program and the programs that we put into effect to have continuing education for pilots and to continue the utilization of new technology.";N
Admiral Cohen, I am certainly aware that the Congress has been a bit disappointed with the performance of the Science and Technology directorate.;N
Well, Co-Chairman Inouye, I know your personal interest in science and technology as an incubator of innovation and how important that is, not only for Hawaii, but also for the free world.;N
I have had a chance to review the Fiscal Year 2007 Senate appropriations language which is very stern and very direct.;N
I could probably take the rest of your afternoon here describing what needs to be done, but I am not yet associated with the Department of Homeland Security.;N
All I can say to you sir, is that over the five plus years that I was at the Office of Naval Research, I encountered many of the same kinds of problems even though Office of Naval Research was very mature and a very effective organization, it was not customer or output-oriented.;N
It was more provider and input-oriented and in today's world, time to market, time to delivery, customer focus for the front line whether they're local, state, tribal, or first responders under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security, they must have near-term enhancements as well as long-term leap ahead improvements and capability.;N
And so, if confirmed, I will bring the same management approach and leadership approach and hands-on personal involvement that you saw at the Office of Naval Research to get our budget process right, get our requirements process right, get our balance between long-term research and near-term enhancements and deliverables right with full disclosure to the Congress.;N
And it's a big job, and Senator I know frequently you hear that when individuals leave government, they say its to spend more time with their family, but my lovely wife, Nancy, reminded me that coming back in the government, it was to spend less time with my family, and so it's a great challenge and I look forward to it sir, if confirmed.;N
In your testimony you mentioned that you hope to bring the U.S. flag fleet back to the predominant role it once had.;N
As a member of an island state, I am naturally concerned about the mission of NOAA, and I concur fully with Chairman Stevens' view on NOAA.;N
I wish to commend all of you for coming forward to serve our Nation, and I can assure you that this committee will help you in your work.;N
I have one question, and that is of Mr. Nottingham and I have some other questions, but I will forward them along later.;N
Previous nominees, Mr. Nottingham, have sat right in that same chair that you're sitting in right now and promised this committee they'd get the small rate case procedure in place on the Surface Transportation Board and it has yet to come.;N
They made those commitments about transparency and improved procedures, enhanced competition and a whole host of promises.;N
Well I thank you and I thank you for meeting with some of the people of my constituents and I would appreciate that.;N
That's the only question I have as time is of the essence, and I have another--but I too want to echo the words of my good friend from Hawaii.;N
It is great that we still have people that put the Nation's interest and the citizens of the United States before themselves and serve this great country with great talent and intelligence and with great integrity, and so we appreciate every one of you stepping forward and doing that.;D
Let me tell all of you nominees that there have been questions filed from both sides of the aisle which we would ask you to respond to.;N
If we can get the responses quickly, we will try to have the meeting off the floor of our committee sometime early next week, so we can get these nominations up and confirmed.;N
We have to report them first so they go on the calendar and then they are subject to review by all of the Members of the Senate, but we will do our best to get them cleared before the end of next week when we expect to recess for our August period.;N
We remember so well meeting with your husband so often, the Admiral, and how gracious he was and how much he contributed to the future of our Navy, so we thank you for taking the time to come with Admiral Cohen.;N
And she comes highly recommended, with your endorsement, so we will be pleased to act on this nomination as quickly as possible.;D
Senator David Pryor and Chris Boskin have been nominated to serve on the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.;N
Although CPB does not produce programs, it awards grants to create public broadcasting programs.;N
As members of the Board of Directors, these nominees would set policies and establish programming priorities.;D
And Ms. Boskin is one of the two nominees today that I think the Committee will be looking at.;N
I would ask consent that my full statement be made a part of the record, and I will be brief.;N
I'm delighted to recommend Charles Snelling for the position on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.;N
I've known Charlie Snelling for 25 years, and he has been an enormous success in business.;D
President Ford, in 1976, appointed him to the President's Commission on Personnel Interchange.;N
He could handle matters of much greater magnitude, but I'm glad he's willing to accept this appointment.;D
He's done outstanding community work, and I know that had Senator Santorum been here to recommended him, he would join me in my praise.;D
And we will proceed with the hearing, then, with Dr. Sharon Hays, who was introduced by Congressman Ehlers.;N
Senator Rockefeller wanted very much to be here at this hearing, but, as you know, he's Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and he had to excuse himself.;N
However, he has asked me to submit his letter to the Committee with his, as I quote, ``unequivocal support'' of Senator Pryor's nomination.;N
I'd like to commend and congratulate and thank Senator Pryor for his many, many years of public service--Congressman, Senator, Ambassador, and now Director.;D
And, with that, I'd like to yield the rest of my time to him, because he told me he's got a whole lot of questions.;N
Mr. Chairman, I think every son looks forward to the moment when they can finally get their father under oath.;N
And the irony of this does not escape my brother and I, because we remember our father, several times when during our teenage years, would tell us to turn the radio down.;N
And--now, Mr. Chairman, of course, I think that David Pryor will do a fantastic job on the corporation board.;D
And, as I mentioned yesterday, I'll recuse myself from the vote, but I'm very, very appreciative for you moving this nomination and having the hearing today.;N
I am going to excerpt from the memos we had prepared before the hearing, a paragraph for each nominee today, and put that ahead of the statements that you are making.;N
I think you're all very excellently qualified for the position in which you've agreed to serve.;D
As two Senators who really have had a great interest in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I can assure you we'll maintain that interest.;N
And we have had similar feelings about the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs and the directorship of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
So, we'll be pleased to try and move these nominations as quickly as possible, and we thank you all for coming.;N
And we'll turn to the next panel, if that's all right, unless any of you wanted to cross-examine us.;N
"We have before us Colonel Calvin Scovel, of Virginia, to be Inspector General of the Department of Transportation; the Honorable Charles Snelling, of Pennsylvania, to be a Member of the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority; and Mr. Collister ``Terry'' Johnson, to be Administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.";N
I'd like to congratulate all of you on your nominations and commend you and thank you for your public service.;D
And unless there's an objection, and I don't expect one, we will prepare all seven of these nominations and do our best to clear them for reporting to the floor after the first vote that occurs following this hearing, unless there is a question that's raised by any absent member, in which case that question would have to be responded to by the nominee before we could go through that procedure, because it does take unanimous consent.;N
But we hope we'll be able to clear these for reporting to the floor sometime next Tuesday, at the latest, and they will be, hopefully, considered by the Senate before we recess for the election period.;N
The General Counsel of the Department will play a key role of guiding the agency through the many challenges ahead.;N
Our Nation's transportation system is slowly collapsing under the tremendous stress of increased congestion caused by growing passenger and freight demand, and years of underinvestment.;N
Tackling these problems will force us to face complex fiscal, environmental safety and security issues requiring extraordinary leadership.;N
America's economic vitality, global competitiveness, and most importantly, our quality of life, depend on our creating a safe and efficient transportation system.;N
Today we'll hear about Mr. Gribbin's qualifications to serve in this important position, and his general outlook with regard to transportation policy, as well as his views on the privatization of public transportation infrastructure.;D
And I don't want Mr. Gribbin or his family to think that because the hall is not filled, that it's not a matter of great interest.;N
And, I look at this from several standpoints, and commend you for wanting to take on this task.;N
As you can imagine--and as you'll find out if everything goes as you'd like it to--that it is a tough job, but, a critically important one.;N
And when you think of our transportation network, I don't think there has been enough made of the calculation concerning our national security.;N
Our transportation network, Mr. Chairman, is a critical element in our country's security: we may call on it for evacuation of people in an emergency, or to move goods and materials that are critical to preventing any attacks.;N
Heaven forbid if one does occur, our transportation system is vital, in terms of being able to respond positively.;N
Now, the Senate must perform its due diligence in assessing and confirming nominees that are put forth by the Bush Administration.;N
And, once again, as I see your family, obviously there's a lot of good characteristics in that group.;N
I have never seen such a well-behaved group of youngsters in my life, and I'm an expert, because I've got 10 grandchildren and 4 kids of my own.;N
So I know it's not easy, especially in something as exciting as this must be to your littlest one.;N
Our country deserves nominees that are qualified, who will carry out their duties provided by law, and not simply blindly follow orders from the White House.;N
to also include your conscience to make sure that the target is a well-functioning transportation system.;N
Recently, President Bush had appointed a nominee to the Board of Amtrak who had never ridden the train before.;N
I asked him a question at his Committee hearing about that, and he said he had just not done it.;N
And that, to me, raised a serious question of judgment--or curiosity--about why the Bush Administration would propose such a person for the job on the Board of Directors.;N
Now, we've not had a chance to meet, Mr. Gribbin, but I look forward to doing so, so we can discuss things together.;N
But, I want to say to you at the outset--I'm concerned about some of the things that you've advocated in the past, especially with respect to privatizing assets owned by the government.;N
Now, we've fought this battle before on Amtrak, and I remind you that Amtrak was a composition of private passenger railroad lines that had to be brought together under government auspices.;N
Our screeners at the airports were employed by private companies--the airlines--and things did not get done well.;N
Now, I come out of the corporate world, Mr. Gribbin, and I ran a large and successful company that I helped start.;N
And, so I know--having had experience in both areas, government and business--that government employees are equally as committed--;D
Because it's not just for profit, it's for some element of soul, some element of responsibility, love of country.;N
So, I would say that my view is that appointees, significant office holders, have to express themselves in a way that gets past pre-conceived ideas and looks at the situation as it currently is.;N
So, I look forward to having some of my questions answered, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you for moving this nomination forward.;N
Obviously, Mr. Gribbin is a man of some considerable talent, but I want to discuss his views on privatization in particular.;N
I would ask, if it's all right with you, Mr. Chairman, whether or not we can hear this statement as Mr. Gribbin has prepared.;N
When it's not trying to shut down Amtrak altogether, the Bush Administration has been advocating privatizing our Nation's passenger railroad system.;N
Now, how are you going to deal with the movement within the Administration to privatize or outsource Amtrak's functions?;N
But, she'll come to you for guidance, you will also, not only be a policymaker, you'll also be a, an auditor as--I'm not using the term in the formal sense--but you'll also be looking at ways that you might think could improve the operations of Amtrak.;N
And, the Administration has not been shy at all about suggesting, through funding, that Amtrak could be shut down.;N
Now, in each case over the last couple years, it's been the Congress--the Senate, and the House--restoring the funding for Amtrak's operations.;N
In the preparation for the budget this year, the amounts allocated through the Budget Committee and in the budget resolution are substantially higher, maybe by twice, than that which comes down from the Bush Administration.;N
So, one of the things that concerns me is the idealogy that if we can shed ourselves of the ownership of Amtrak, we can also shed ourselves of the responsibility of funding it.;D
You've had this experience working in the private sector with a company that is one of the largest operators of toll roads.;D
Unless the borrowing is supported by the full faith and credit of the entity, being the state or county or the Federal Government.;N
And, are those conditions particularly noted in the agreement with the private contractors that the state--most of these are state-owned roads, I assume--do they ask, or must they in order to borrow in the marketplace at the best rates, do they ask for the support of the state government, in terms of the issuance of these bonds?;N
Why do we see the borrowing process easier in the private sector than in the public sector?;N
What happens to the--your experience has been fairly limited to highway issues, but the future transportation needs of our country can not be met by cars and airplanes alone.;D
Now, if confirmed, how would you ensure that we have a balanced transportation system, with rail travel options for both travelers and freight shippers?;N
Well, the experience that you described about going up to New York is interesting, because I do it on a regular basis.;N
I go up to either Newark airport or LaGuardia airport because I live in New Jersey, mid-way between the two airports.;N
And, what I find is that I'll get on a flight, as I did last Friday night--a week ago, Mr. Chairman--for a 5 o'clock flight.;N
And, the 5 o'clock flight left the ground at 7:15 p.m., and got to New York--after circling awhile--at 8:15 p.m., and then we found that there were no gates ready for us, so that took another 10 minutes.;N
And there's going to be a whole series of new airplanes, they're being introduced, the very light jets.;N
"And so, we now see these late flights--one out of four flights across America; even more out of Newark are delayed--but across America, the delays are still enormous.";N
And, so, and if we talk about an alternative that suggests that maybe Amtrak could help relieve the congestion, if we then want to put it in the private marketplace where it, again, had its origination, I think that leaves us in a difficult position.;N
Now, your employer, Macquarie, purchased the Virginia Dulles Greenway from a Haliburton subsidiary that had defaulted on its debt payments.;N
Now it's clear that the Haliburton subsidiary cashed out, now Macquarie is looking to raise tolls on Northern Virginia drivers.;N
Do you see a role for rail in dealing with emergencies like 9/11 or natural disasters like hurricanes?;N
You know, Mr. Chairman, there were a couple of major nuclear generating/energy generating plants that were abandoned after the facility was built, and built meaning having invested billions of dollars.;N
They were abandoned because there was no satisfactory evacuation process or design to get people away if there was a problem in the nuclear plant.;N
So, do you see a role for dealing with emergencies like 9/11, natural disasters like hurricanes, or those accidents?;N
Or breakdowns in the system, as a result of insufficient access to modes of transportation, like rail?;N
OK, so do you see any inconsistency between your call, call for privatization and the reliability of having facilities available for emergencies?;N
Is that portion of the system a candidate for privatizing, with all of the infrastructure improvement that has to be made there?;N
And, Mr. Chairman, the one thing that I think we have to make certain of, is that, talks about privatization should take place before there's any precipitous action--or any action--;N
because it's going to run afoul, many thoughts about privatizing something as essential as rail systems, that have their peculiarity of making money, or at least having decent revenues when the work hours are there, but otherwise having to make up for a lot of dead time and idle equipment.;N
I have the honor today, Mr. Chairman, to introduce to the Committee Mr. Charles Snelling for reappointment to the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.;N
I've known Mr. Snelling for more than two decades, and can personally attest to his integrity, his ability, and his public service.;D
Of direct relevance to serving on the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is his extensive experience in the field of aviation.;D
He has served on the board of directors for the Authority since 2003, when he was originally nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate.;D
He was appointed, in 2000, by Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge, to be a member and chair of the Pennsylvania Advisory Committee.;D
He had served as the--on the board of directors of the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority, which operates the Lehigh Valley International Airport.;D
He is President and Director of the Snelling Company and Western Lehigh Valley Corporation, a trustee of the Northeast Pennsylvania Management Trust, and a director of the Wiley Technologies, former president of the City Council of Allentown, served as trustee on the Lehigh Valley Hospital Health Network, 5 years in that capacity.;D
And it is always hard to see what happens there, but there was a hold, and we don't know exactly why.;N
And it's my hope that we'll be able to move his nomination through the Committee, and move it through the floor, so that he can take his position on this Authority, where I think he can perform very, very valuable public service.;D
I would have been here earlier, but we are struggling to get a quorum in the Judiciary Committee, where, as the Chairman knows, I am ranking member.;N
If you'll just wait a few seconds, the record will show that no one has voiced an objection to the nomination of Mr. Snelling.;N
And so, without objection, the nomination is approved, and it will be reported to the Senate forthwith.;N
And I'm here for the great pleasure and honor to introduce to the Committee a fellow Floridian, a fellow who has devoted a great deal of time to serving the people of my state.;D
Denver Stutler is currently the President of Stutler Strategies, Incorporated, and a Founding Member of Perkins Bay, a real estate consulting firm in Tampa.;N
The Florida Secretary of Transportation, as my colleague from Florida well knows, is a very important and responsible job, and Mr. Stutler did it with--of course, I should say, Secretary Stutler--did it with great distinction.;N
And, being from the State of Florida, I was the HUD Secretary, and we worked on a number of issues relating to our state as our responsibilities intersected.;N
Before that time, he was Chief of Staff to former Governor Jeb Bush, and, I know, in both of these public roles he made many positive contributions to improving Florida's transportation infrastructure and economic development.;D
Prior to serving Governor Bush, Mr. Stutler served as the Senior Fellow for U.S. Senator Connie Mack, where he advised the Senator on environmental and water-related appropriations and policy.;D
Denver earned his bachelor's degree in engineering, and master's degree in civil engineering, from the University of Central Florida, and has since demonstrated an outstanding commitment to public service.;D
It's because of this record of dedication that I believe Denver Stutler is fully qualified to serve on the Amtrak Reform Board, and it is my hope that he will continue to ensure the availability of safe and reliable transportation service for all Americans.;D
Mr. Chairman, as you know, Senator Martinez and I have an excellent professional relationship, as well as a personal relationship that goes back 30 years.;D
Chairman, I think, without exception, on all of the appointments that we have a chance to recommend, Senator Martinez and I have been joined at the hip in being unanimous about the particular nominees, particularly if they affect Florida.;N
And, in this particular case, of Mr. Stutler to be on the Amtrak Board, we, likewise, are unanimous in our opinion that he should be appointed to the Amtrak Board, for all of the reasons that Senator Martinez has just stated.;N
Each of the nominees before us are slated to fill important posts critical to the future of America's transportation system.;N
From ensuring the safety of the country's pipelines to overseeing the management of the Nation's passenger railroad, the work you will perform at each of your respective agencies should be confirmed--should you be confirmed, will help ensure that America's transportation system remains a global leader which supports our vibrant economy and great tradition of efficient travel and mobility.;N
The Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration must continue to chart a course for the Department of Transportation's newest safety agency that will improve the safety and security of our pipeline and hazardous materials transportation systems.;N
Several recent pipeline accidents have highlighted the importance of this task, and we are looking for strong leadership at this agency, as well as a commitment to implement, fully, the important safety provisions enacted into law by this Committee in the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006.;N
Amtrak Board Members must continue the progress made over the last several years toward an efficient and effective national passenger railroad, while working with the Congress to reauthorize Amtrak, gain stable and adequate funding, and promote new investments that can unlock the promise of rail service in new corridors.;N
Members of the Surface Transportation Board must balance the growing need for new and expanded capital investment in the freight rail industry against the equal--the legitimate goal of ensuring reasonable and fair prices and services for railroad customers.;N
Add to each of these individual challenges the government-wide budget constraints brought on by historic deficits and continued demands to improve safety and mobility, your work is truly cut out for you.;N
I look forward to hearing your perspectives today as we examine your credentials and views.;N
We have heard nothing negative about his nomination, and, unless there is an objection, it is my plan to consider his nomination at an executive session, along with the other nominees on the panel.;N
As many of you know, Alaska is the home of the one of the largest pipeline systems in the world, one which has transported over 15 billion barrels of oil since its inception in 1977.;N
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration plays a critical role in maintaining this pipeline and ensuring the safe transportation of oil and other hazardous goods all over the country.;N
This morning I am pleased to see Carl Johnson here as the nominee for Administrator of this important agency.;N
Before retiring in April, Mr. Johnson spent 19 years serving as President of the Compressed Gas Association, where he developed an extensive understanding of the transportation of hazardous materials.;D
During his tenure, Mr. Johnson was dedicated to decreasing the risks associated with industrial and medical gases through the development of consensus standards, and he was instrumental in a push to harmonize these and other safety standards on a global scale.;D
Before joining the Compressed Gas Association, Mr. Johnson worked at Corning Glass Works for 24 years, where he was the Director of Federal Government Relations.;D
It was there that he met my good friend and colleague, former Representative Amory Houghton, who brought Mr. Johnson to the Hill in 1987, following his election to the House of Representatives.;D
While working in the House, Mr. Johnson was responsible for leading the Congressman's work on the Government Operations Committee and had a hand in several key issues in the District.;D
This Committee enjoyed an excellent working relationship with Admiral Barrett, the original Administrator of PHMSA, and I look forward to continuing such a relationship with his successor.;D
His wife, Gail, with whom a number of us met yesterday, was stricken, I think, en route to the hearing today, and has been hospitalized, I think, at GW, with a stroke of some kind, or a seizure, which is a matter of great concern.;N
I've just called him on the phone to try to reach him, and was unable to reach him, but our thoughts and prayers are with her, and certainly with him.;N
I've known him for the better part of a dozen years, and sort of--together, because our names are similar.;D
It's hard to imagine that there are two Tom Carpers, but actually there's a third, who was poet laureate of Maine at one time.;D
But I knew Mayor Carper when he became a Member of the Amtrak Board of Mayors Advisory Council, I think, in about 1991, about 15 years ago, and actually served as his Chairman from 2000 to 2001, while he was still Mayor of Macomb.;D
I believe we're fortunate to have our other two nominees before us today for the Amtrak Board.;N
We've passed, with the guidance of our leadership here on this Committee, major energy legislation that the President appears ready to sign, and that'll be a good thing for our country as we seek to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and to reduce the emission of harmful substances into the air.;N
I remember being regaled by stories by my aunts and uncles of train rides from coast to coast to be married during the middle of World War II, and just--at a time when we had troop trains going all over the country, and had no interstate railroad, and commercial aviation was still in its infancy.;N
I actually think maybe some of the best days, some of the most important days for passenger rail in this country lie ahead, as we do seek to reduce our reliance on foreign oil.;N
A lot of other countries share that goal with us, and a lot of them fund their intercity passenger rail systems, support them more robustly than we do at both the operating and the capital level.;N
"But they do so for selfish reasons, and we should, as well; and among those selfish reasons are to, as I said earlier, reduce reliance on foreign oil; second, to reduce the kind of congestions we face on our highways today.";N
Coming down on--I actually take the train, many days, to Washington, but I can actually look out my window of the train, as we zipped along at 125 miles an hour, and see cars and trucks barely moving on the highways alongside of us.;N
So, we need to reduce our reliance--we need to reduce our congestions on our roads, and our airports.;N
My wife just flew out to the Appalachian State/Delaware football game out at--in Chattanooga last weekend, and she had some great stories to tell me about trying to get there by air.;N
And so, all--I think all of us have had a bite out of that apple, and we know what challenges it poses for us.;N
We breathe air that is not healthy, not good for us, not good for our children, not good for our grandparents, our parents, and we need to do something about it.;N
And it's not a silver bullet, but it's a speedier train than it used to be, and it's part of the solution to those two challenges that we face.;N
I'm anxious to hear their goals and the plan--and their plans for this--these very important positions.;N
I'm going to be focusing on their views of the abandonment process, of balancing interests between shippers and railroads.;N
These are legitimate sources of capital, but I am concerned about short-term investor goals trumping long-term interests of our commerce in this country.;N
And I'm very anxious to know what they believe the STB's role is in ensuring that investments are made to maintain this basic infrastructure, because I'm afraid that that is being shortchanged, and I'm very anxious to see a much more vigorous role so that people in rural areas who have raw materials and products to get to market can get them there, and that they're not held hostage, as is happening in too many places in this country.;N
I now would like to call upon the Administrator-designate of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Mr. Carl T. Johnson.;N
"designate Amtrak Board of Directors, Mr. Denver Stutler; and Member, Surface Transportation Board, the Honorable Francis Mulvey.";N
Mr. Chairman, I welcome Mr. Johnson, because I think we probably have an example of aging pipelines in our state.;N
We are very conscious of the safety factors, and we will look to him for guidance, and I hope that he will be able to suggest to Congress if there are any changes in existing law that should be considered in order to assure the safety and survival of these pipeline systems.;N
I just want to run through a couple of comments that I had prepared and--just to highlight the need that we have for infrastructure investment.;N
No matter where we look, we see crowding, we see delays, we see congestion, we see pollution.;N
Very frankly, I'm depending on the Amtrak Board nominees to not just talk about the betterment of their financial condition, but the betterment of their operation.;N
What do we want from Amtrak, in terms of its--it being the third leg--or passenger rail service--the third leg in our transportation system?;N
When you look at highways, and if you look at the skyways, they are unable, with their present conditioning, to be able to accommodate America's needs.;N
And I'd point out--and I learned, just recently--or I looked, just recently--at the population growth in this country.;N
Airport runways, for instance, do not have the best technology on the runways to keep our passengers and flight crews safe.;N
And so, as we struggle to meet travelers' demands--and I use Amtrak frequently, because I found out that a 45-minute flight from here to New York or Newark Airport--I live midway between the two, in New Jersey--and I find that the 45-minute flight from here to New York region airports can take 2 or 3 hours--45-;N
And, oddly enough, my two colleagues who sit at the front of the desk, the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, are the furthest from Amtrak that you could be and still be in the United States.;N
"Well there is no link from Fairbanks to Canada; otherwise, we could put rail cars through the Alaska railroad, the Canadian system, and down into Amtrak.";N
In any event, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask that my statement be--full statement be included----;N
"Carper, I understand, couldn't be here, regrettably; I learned that--the reason for his not being here--but each of you, as those who are Amtrak nominees, have each of you ridden recently on Amtrak?";N
I came down on the railroad yesterday from Newark to Washington, and I was on the bumpy trains.;N
But it just--even as it makes progress, it's obvious that it hasn't kept up with the current need.;N
And the one thing I would caution those of you who are nominees, is, when you look at the reform, I have--you have to think deeply about what you mean by ``reform.'';N
A reform doesn't simply mean getting--looking just at the work rules or things of that nature, to--but what role the railroad should play in America's near future--not far-;N
And I think that you have an obligation to try and make sure that, whatever funding we can get for Amtrak, we must get.;N
And, Mr. Chairman, all of us here are now aware of the fact that we are having a particular funding mechanism go into play, omnibus funding for our needs, and we've already been notified that this year's Amtrak expectation, not the new Amtrak reauthorization bill, but just the appropriations required, has been cut by $100 million.;N
And these things play a terrible role in making sure that Amtrak, that has never been sufficiently funded--if we'd look at what's happened in Europe, Germany spent $7 billion a year, I think, for 10 years to get their system up to snuff.;N
And, since this has been a public corporation since the early 1970s, I don't think we've spent $30 million--$30 billion.;N
And I would caution you about making certain that you stand up for more funding and don't simply defend an administration position on what they want to do.;N
I didn't see you making any--either of you making comments in the--in your statements about what the problems might be.;N
If we could get Amtrak to accelerate its ride between here and New York, I think that we could relieve the skyways of some of the pressure that we have, the shuttles that go back and forth.;N
Now, what experience did you learn in that Administration that--because that project was killed.;N
Do you think that experience will help you, as a Member of the Board of Amtrak, when you see projects that demand a bold approach in the--something that may be painful in developing, but on the--in the final analysis, will make our rail system a lot more efficient and better for us?;N
But I'd like the record to be kept open so we can submit written questions to our friends at the witness table.;N
If I could, I'd like to yield to Senator Smith, then I'll, maybe, succeed him, if I could.;N
Do you need some legislative authority, that we ought to be getting to you, to have the enforcement---- ;N
Well, I hope that if you find, as you proceed after your confirmation--reconfirmation--that you need more authority than you have, that you will come to this Committee, and we will write you authority to make sure you have the tools necessary to serve the public.;N
Do you believe that the abandonment process effectively balances the interests of shippers and railroads?;N
I just want to register my concern--my question, really--that perhaps the abandonment process does not adequately balance the interests of involved shippers and railroads.;N
Well, to that very issue, Commissioner, earlier this fall the short-line railroad that provided service along a 136-mile stretch in southwest Oregon announced it would suspend service, due to safety concerns involving the line's tunnels.;N
The Federal Railroad Administration engineers have toured the line and confirmed that it is a safety hazard.;N
``predominant problems observed were decay of untreated cinder timbers, lagging and footing blocks.'';N
The FRA's inspectors noted that ``some of the timbers sound hollow and decayed when struck with a hammer.'';N
Now, clearly this situation did not happen overnight, this has been going on, apparently, for a long, long time.;N
And what I really want to know is what Surface Transportation Board's role is in ensuring that investments are made to provide proper maintenance so that we don't get into these situations and literally strand--leave stranded hundreds of family-supporting, good wage jobs that work in mills, that work in fish processing, that work in places that really have no other transportation alternative, because the winding roads to get to I-5 are simply already congested.;N
Who's responsible, and who do we look to for an answer to--when we go back home and we are confronted with hundreds of people who are saying, ``Well, wait a minute, they didn't make the investment, and my job is coming to a close because we can't ship what we produce here''?;N
And please don't regard this as a criticism of you, Commissioner, that is not intended so--but somebody's failed on the job, candidly.;N
But, you know, whether it's FRA or STB, we need somebody that has some authority and some accountability, and this is an issue that really does impact, adversely, rural places.;N
Oregon and Washington are one of just a handful of states who meet their Amtrak copayment obligation.;N
I was very pleased to help participate in passing the Amtrak reform bill that moves into a more fair allocation of cost-sharing with states fulfilling their responsibilities, too.;N
But when it comes to cost allocation and capital match, I want to really highlight to you, the key is--;N
And so, I wonder if any of you have a comment about the role you see for States in expanding passenger rail and ensuring that the whole system remains viable.;N
Again, thanks to our witnesses for your presence and for your willingness to serve our country.;D
First, Secretary Stutler, when you left my office yesterday, you were having real problems with your back, and I could tell you were in a lot of pain.;N
I don't know if you're in pain right now, but if it gets to be too painful, I'd stand up, if I were you, and we'll try not to make the pain any more painful than it needs to be.;N
The question I--one of the questions I asked our Amtrak nominees yesterday--and I just wanted to come back to it again today, to ask each of you just to share with us your vision for passenger rail service in the 21st century.;N
Let me ask--and this would be a question for you, Secretary Stutler, and then for Ms. Naples, as well.;N
When--putting on your old hat as the Secretary of Transportation for your state, how can we create a better partnership between the Federal Government--federally funded Amtrak, working in concert with the states and working in concert with the private freight railroads who own the track over which Amtrak needs to travel outside of the corridor?;N
We were talking, yesterday, about--and you mentioned again today in your testimony--that the ridership--you, sort of, wondered aloud yesterday, and again today, why the ridership on Amtrak is as low as it is.;N
Actually, in the Northeast Corridor you can't buy a train ticket for the next week or two, and it was that way around Thanksgiving.;N
When--the regionals do well, but not that well--but when you get outside the corridor and Amtrak doesn't own the track, as you know, they've got to get out of the way of the freights.;N
And the priority of the freight railroads, for the most part, is to move freight, not people.;N
But, just--my question is, how do we make it--if you--I think of it like--almost like three legs of a stool--Federal Government, through Amtrak, the State governments, and the for-;N
profit freight railroads--how do we get them, better, to work together to provide the underpinning for passenger rail service that works outside of the corridor?;N
And we've seen some examples out of Chicago, in the Midwest and certainly on the West Coast, that might provide some examples.;N
Mrs. Naples and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee, I'm pleased to congratulate you on your nominations and to thank you for your public service.;N
We will be submitting questions for your consideration, and I hope you can respond to them.;N
This afternoon, in mid-afternoon, we will have an executive session, at which time Mr. Johnson, Ms. Naples, Mr. Stutler, Dr. Mulvey, and Mr. Carper will be confirmed.;N
I think these are two very important positions at the Department of Transportation, and I look forward to the hearing today.;N
They might have a boat from time to time, but year-round transportation is air transportation.;N
It is important that the FAA maintain knowledge of Alaska, and Mr. Sturgell, I am a little concerned about the retention of our people in the FAA in Alaska.;N
And because of our unique terrain and this enormous aviation community, it is essential that we have people up there who understand the state and understand the weather in the state.;N
So I look forward to having the chance to discuss this with you, and I want to work with the Chairman and both of you, when you are confirmed, and try to see if we can do our best to improve the aviation system of our country.;N
As a frequent flyer between California and Washington, as in well more than a million miles since I came to Congress, I know firsthand the challenges the flying public faces when they travel.;N
The Department of Transportation confirmed on Tuesday what airline passengers have known all year, that 2007 was the second-worst year on record for airline delays.;N
I am very concerned about the fact that the air traffic controllers in my state are telling me that FAA simply doesn't grasp the full implications of the increasing number of air traffic controller retirements across the Nation.;N
Controllers tell me that a wave of retirements, dispute over pay, controller fatigue, excessive overtime hours, training of new hires, and unsuitable working conditions in the towers are creating a safety hazard on the ground and in the air for the passengers.;N
This is very serious, I think, to all of us, and we look forward to hearing your response with your plans to deal with this.;N
The economic impact of delays in the aviation industry have a negative impact on our economy.;N
Data released this week, as Senator Boxer just noted, 2007 was one of the worst years for commercial flights in this country.;N
More bags were lost, and there were more customer complaints than in 2006 and the most since the year 2000.;N
That data alone is all we need to move expeditiously on the FAA reauthorization bill stuck in the Senate.;N
I do not agree with the premise that we have to create a new bureaucratic system of fee collection to pay for the improvements to the air traffic control system.;N
I see no reason why we cannot use the current payment system of fuel and excise taxes to fund the FAA.;N
The money needed to pay for the NextGen system can be collected through the current financing structure much more simply, much less expensively.;N
I am looking forward to hearing Mr. Sturgell's explanation for why we cannot use the current system to pay for NextGen Air Transportation System.;N
I am not convinced the FAA has the capability to implement a system that requires the technological change currently proposed.;N
The FAA does not have the best track record when it comes to implementing new technological systems.;N
I am also concerned about the FAA's reliance on technology for the NextGen system that is not available and may not be available when needed.;N
I have yet to hear when key system technological capabilities will be delivered, how much capacity will be added to the system, and how much of the old system will be retained as a backup.;N
I am interested in learning what we can do to improve our Nation's airways between now and then.;N
I am concerned that when we discuss NextGen, no one talks about the need for more capacity on the ground.;N
But without places to land and gates to receive those planes, we will still have those same problems on the ground as in the sky.;N
It was aviation that enabled a coast-to-coast development that made us the great Nation that we are today.;N
And if these nominees are confirmed, their whole responsibility is to shape our Nation's transportation future on the rails, the highways, and in the sky, and thusly, we have created a critical obligation to be as thorough as we can in the selection of these government leaders.;N
I first want to apologize to Congressman LoBiondo for not having been here to welcome him.;N
And I know that he came to introduce Simon Gros, who is nominated to be Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs for DOT.;N
I have worked with Mr. Gros since he has been with the Department of Transportation and noted his professionalism and diligence, and I believe the Committee should confirm his nomination.;D
And if I might take this opportunity to congratulate you on taking your 15,000th vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate?;N
There were distinguished Members of the Senate who told that for the truth yesterday, and the remarks were very generous and well deserved.;N
I want to congratulate the two nominees and to say that I read their testimony with interest.;N
I wish both of you well, and I will simply, by way of opening statement, express my hope that they will maintain an interest in the small communities of the United States that serve rural America.;N
The FAA Contract Tower Program continues to be one of the most successful and cost-effective FAA-industry partnerships, as validated numerous times by the Department of Transportation Inspector General.;N
There are seven FAA contract towers in my state of Mississippi alone, and the bottom line is that without this program, many of these smaller airports would not be benefiting from the important safety benefits that control towers provide the flying public.;N
So I would hope that, if confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Chairman, these two witnesses will continue to maintain as a top priority the 249 smaller airports in America that benefit from this program.;N
She is the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee for Aviation, and she wants to have me voice her support for these two nominations and hope that we will have a chance for early confirmation.;N
I want to welcome our nominees this morning and appreciate your willingness to serve the country.;N
And Mr. Sturgell, I know I have had the opportunity to visit with you a little bit about some of the airline issues that are important in my State.;N
But I would just, when we get into questions, be interested in hearing a little bit about your views on airline consolidation.;N
That is something that is of great interest to those of us who represent rural areas and what that might mean in terms of service and cost and what not for travelers in rural areas of the country.;N
Of course, last year everybody knows was second-worst ever on record, and that is something that also I think all of us on the panel are very interested in and hope that you will tackle and attack.;N
And I know in your capacity as the Acting Administrator, you have been focusing on that, and I would encourage you to continue to do that and look forward to hearing your thoughts about how we might be able to improve even further on that.;N
I think the two of us, the Chairman and I, probably fly a greater distance on aircraft than any Senators in history.;N
I just want to remind the Committee of one instance where I went to National, and we had to wait 2 hours because the cabin crew was stuck in New York because of a storm.;N
We took off 2 hours late, went to the Midwest hub, and we were first told there was a mechanical problem, but then they told us the truth and said we were waiting for pilots.;N
But I want you to know, I don't think it is the FAA's problem necessarily, but the FAA has neglected to deal with the operators of these aircraft to work out a system where we are not delayed because the crews aren't there.;N
And I think one of your first jobs should be to look into how to manage the airlines so there are people there to man them and fly them, and they are fueled and with food onboard before they take off.;N
I really think that all of these delays are related to the problem of allowing crews to live in one part of the country and fly into another.;N
If you don't examine it, I am going to ask the Chairman to examine it here with public hearings.;N
When the CAB was eliminated from the system and we created the FAA and we had the concept of really not the government no longer designing airline routes and who flew where and how often, one of the things that we started was to automate a lot of the flight service stations around the country.;N
But there was an agreement made in my state, Alaska, that because of its size and the dependence upon aviation, as I indicated, the flight service stations would be maintained.;N
Some time later, we were told that the contract to manage those flight service stations had been worked out with Lockheed, and Lockheed took over the management of them.;N
I met just last week with a group of those flight station operators who are slowly but surely leaving because of the changes in policy--I understand Lockheed walked away from that, and now it is back with FAA.;N
One young woman told me she was 4 days from her retirement, and she was given a discharge.;N
Two others told me that they had just signed up for their extension of service, and they were told they were going to be reassigned to another State.;N
Now, I don't think you have many flight service stations left in the rest of the United States, do you?;N
But the numbers of the flight service operators are about 50 percent of what they were 3 years ago.;N
How would you like to land in Sicily with someone sitting in Paris telling you what the quality of the runway was?;N
It is Italy, Germany, France, and Spain put together, and you are trying to run it from Anchorage.;N
We eliminated deaths in our aviation community with the cooperation of your predecessor, and I think we have the best flight safety concepts in the world now.;N
But the problems that are coming up now are because of the lack of information about the condition of the airports where these pilots are flying into and the lack of information on the ground as to changes in conditions that have occurred while the plane has been in the air.;N
Because half of the flight service stations were closed, I am told, within the last 3 years.;N
You know there are three mountain ranges in Alaska, and if you flew out of Adak, you were in safe country compared to the north country.;N
I really want to work with you, but I met with a group of people, both in the industry, both operators and personnel in those flight service stations, and they are an angry crew.;N
I want to talk with you, Mr. Sturgell, about the passenger bill of rights that Senator Snowe and I wrote and the fact that you are coming out with proposed rulemaking.;N
Why do you have a rule that does not--a proposed rule that doesn't include minimum standards for airline contingency plans for food, water, and a timetable for passengers to deplane when they are stranded on the tarmac?;N
Well, let me just say because I don't--do you believe that the final rule will have minimum standards?;N
So that we know that our people aren't going to be starving, and if they are sitting on the tarmac for hours, that the toilets are going to be working?;N
The point of Senator Snowe's bill and my bill is so that we, as America, say you can treat people, you must treat people with dignity and respect and be concerned about their safety.;N
Will you have, I just want a yes or no, minimum standards in that rule for the airlines to follow?;N
Well, then Olympia Snowe and I are going to have to have a meeting with Secretary Peters about it.;N
GAO reported in December that at least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities were working 6-day weeks.;N
So you think 10 hours a day, 6 days a week is going to lead us to have safety in the skies.;N
I just--I feel it is important for my Chairman to hear certain things, and I just think what we have just heard, unless I was wrong, is that Mr. Sturgell believes that a 6-day week, 10 hours a day, is a fair work schedule for our controllers.;N
But my understanding is the GAO reported at least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities were working that 6-day week as a regular schedule.;N
I might, if I was poor or had a problem or had a divorce and had to pay my wife or whatever my circumstances are, I might volunteer to work 12 hours a day.;N
I am asking you whether you think it works for safety in the skies to have 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities, including towers at major airports, working 6 days a week?;N
So am I to assume then that you are concerned that GAO reported that at least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities are working 6 days a week, including towers at major airports?;N
The December 2007 GAO report mentioned the FAA may not be accurately reporting the number and details of runway incursions.;N
Why did the FAA not immediately investigate a possible runway incursion at San Diego airport 2 weeks ago?;N
But the GAO, I mean, this isn't me or Senator Stevens or Senator Inouye or Rockefeller or Hutchison, this is the GAO, December 2007, said you may not be accurately reporting the number and details of runway incursions.;N
I hope that I can infer from that that it is an unacceptable situation, and you are going to sit everybody down and get to the bottom of it.;N
Because, here, I would like to put in the record an article from the The San Diego Union-Tribune, January 26, the FAA blamed a runway incursion on a control tower mistake.;N
But I will get this over to you, sir, and I would like it if you could please get back to me on that.;N
And during that time, we had some controversy over the granting--I'm sorry, the denial of the waiver to California.;N
Now, it has been reported that you were involved in the lobbying campaign conducted by DOT officials last year in which you were contacting Governors and Members of Congress, seeking to generate opposition to the California waiver request.;N
You have been quoted as saying that, within DOT, the people involved in the effort were Secretary Peters, yourself, and five other DOT staffers, but you have been unclear about the involvement of others in the Executive Branch.;N
CEQ? EPA? Did you ever talk to people in those agencies during the time you were lobbying Members of Congress and Governors and others?;N
Did you ever have e-mail conversations with anyone in the President's office or the Vice President's office or at the CEQ?;N
The reason I raise it is that it is not appropriate, nor within the traditions of our government, for an agency to lobby another agency and to gin up Members of Congress.;N
So I am going to send you a letter, just for you to put this in writing, and I do thank you very much for letting us know in the past what occurred at that time.;N
I regret that I didn't note before your incredible record, which I note with envy, of 15,000 votes, and I congratulate you for that.;N
Do you remember the experience of 2003 in terms of hiring, or how many people did you hire in the year 2003?;N
We are often told, and I had many discussions with Ms. Blakey about this, I would check with the towers and see what they have had.;N
So you have to make up for that in addition to being able to get the training that is necessary.;N
You make a blanket statement, if I understand you correctly, that you are right on schedule, that all of the towers are populated by the trained controllers that they should have, including the newer of those in training.;N
Have we--did we anticipate the number of retirements accurately, do you think, over the last couple of years?;N
And Mr. Sturgell, even former Administrator Blakey admitted that her refusal to work with air traffic controllers and negotiate a new agreement on pay and working conditions led to a mass exodus of controllers.;N
Are you listening to the employees at the bargaining table or to obtain a voluntary agreement with them?;N
Well, that says, no matter how carefully the words are planted, if you are working to improve it, it must have been deficient in the past.;N
In 2006, Lexington, Kentucky, the crash that took 49 lives, the pilots did not have the most recent published information about runway layouts, which it said contributed to the crash.;N
And why did the FAA change flight departure headings out of Newark airport before even publishing the new information?;N
Do they make changes without forewarning or providing the knowledge to pilots and those interested parties, controllers, et cetera, before they make changes?;N
But now we are talking about passenger aircraft, and we are talking about the responsibility to make sure that they are----;N
And we are still waiting to see what kind of material is being given out so that, as far in advance as possible, the pilots are alerted to the changes that are being made.;N
And Mr. Sturgell, Mr. Gros, thank you again for your service, and I want to begin by saying that on behalf of our constituents, in most cases, want to make sure that Members of Congress can identify with their circumstances and feel their pain, so to speak.;N
And when it comes to airline service, that is one area where most of us, particularly those of us who travel back and forth on a regular basis, can relate and have, on many occasions, sat in terminals and with our constituents, many of whom expect us to be able to do something about their plight.;N
But I do want to say, and I think that it has already been emphasized here with respect to the statistics last year and how those square with history, that most of us, I think a lot of these things tend to be weather-related.;N
And certainly nobody wants anybody to take any risks that would jeopardize or put anybody in a situation that is unsafe, and that is not controllable.;N
So, but the fact that these statistics continue to slip and deteriorate over time suggest that many of the factors adding to delays are factors that are controllable.;N
And a 75 percent performance on-time arrival for any other industry, that is a D, if you were scoring it if you were a professor in college.;N
And any other business that was only able to provide on-time service 75 percent of the time probably would be out of business.;N
And I guess the thing that concerns me about the airline industry generally is there seems to be sort of an acceptance of mediocrity.;N
And I think that these factors, and I will associate myself with the comments from the Senator from Alaska, when it comes to pilots not being available or those types of issues, those are issues that, in my view, are in most cases within the control of the airline.;N
And I hope that the airlines, of course, who I am sure are listening, would take note of the importance of improving on those statistics and hopefully restoring what I would call, I guess, a culture of excellence when it comes to the delivery of this very important service.;N
Anymore travel has become--when people ask me, always when you talk in front of a group, people ask you what is the best part and the worst part about your job.;N
And that has, unfortunately, I think become the reality for way too many people in this country.;N
But given that fact, and I hope that this can be improved upon, but I also think it is important if that is going to be the state of play in the airline industry that consumers need to know who is good and who is not, who is getting there on-;N
And I introduced a bill a while back that would require a certain amount of reporting for those flights that are delayed, those flights that are chronically canceled on a flight-by-;N
And I think it is important for consumers to know, so at least they can make informed choices.;N
When they go in, they are booking a flight, that is the type of data that needs to be available.;N
Now what the airlines will tell you, and they are correct, is that that data is available.;N
But I think it needs to be available in a more usable form to people who are purchasing tickets.;N
And so, I would--I am going to continue to work with the FAA reauthorization to see that we get some of those provisions put in that require the airlines to at least inform consumers so they can make choices about which flights on a consistent basis are being delayed or canceled and those that aren't.;N
Because I think it would go a long ways toward helping make the airlines a little bit more responsive as well.;N
But I do want to follow up with a question that I mentioned earlier, and that has to do with this whole issue of airline consolidation.;N
Because I think that, and you can argue, I am sure, both ways on this and I have heard arguments that in my area of the country that we would benefit from having a consolidated airline that has perhaps economies of scale and is a stronger airline financially in terms of both routes and prices and everything else.;N
The widely held view among consumers is that fewer airlines means less competition and, therefore, fewer options and perhaps higher prices.;N
And so, there is a discussion about some mergers that would affect my State in particular and a lot of other states in my region of the country.;N
And I guess I would be interested in your thoughts about whether you see that as a good thing or a bad thing when it comes to service, when it comes to price, and just overall quality for people who travel in rural areas.;N
So if I could get you to comment--I would direct this, I guess, to you, Mr. Administrator--first, on the need for more information for passengers and, second, the whole issue of consolidation, how that might impact service into rural areas?;N
Mr. Gros, I don't know if you want to comment on either or I am sure you hear from folks up here quite often on issues related to service and information.;N
So if you have any comment on either or both of those issues, I would be interested in hearing that as well.;N
And Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate your answers and I would just urge you to continue to focus, and I know you are, in trying to address these problems with congestion on the East Coast and into New York that create ripple effects throughout the entire system.;N
But this is an issue that is creating a tremendous amount of frustration among the traveling public, as I think you know.;N
And as I said before, there is no question that a lot, not a lot, but some of this is caused by circumstances and factors that are outside the control of the airlines, that being the weather.;N
But to the degree that there are issues that are within the control, these things just need to be addressed.;N
And the numbers and the statistics, particularly in this last year, are just unacceptable.;N
I want to talk about the 4,000 employees that have received e-mails that they are going to be laid off on March 1.;N
Now you are required to give them written notice, and I am not going to argue about an e-mail versus written notice.;N
But it is serious because these people come from your research, your engineering, your development division, your facilities, your equipment division.;N
Your air traffic controllers are, I believe, under contract until sometime in the middle of 2009.;N
We have to, Mr. Chairman--and we have to do it in the Finance Committee--we have to make an extension because this is a very severe crisis.;N
You cannot address 4,000 people by e-mail and have them facing layoffs March 1 because, in effect, it is laying them off right then.;N
Their psychology changes, their attitude at work changes, and they are frightened, as they should be.;N
We have to work out with Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee a way of extending--we have massive budget problems, and I won't get into the reasons why.;N
The Chairman of the Finance Committee only wants to make the extension for these 4,000 employees to be paid for a couple of months, and that doesn't work.;N
So he and I and Kay Bailey Hutchison need to talk to make sure that at least it is extended to the end of the fiscal year.;N
That, in itself, doesn't provide a whole lot of comfort, but it is probably all that we can do in this particular year.;N
But my question, my first question to you--I only have two--is do you detect an effect, and I want you to answer this to your own advantage, do you detect an effect on 4,000 FAA employees not having received a pink slip, but having received an e-mail saying they will be out of a job as of March 1st?;N
On April 23, The Washington Post had an article called ``FAA Has Some Unhappy Controllers.'';N
Now you have a lot of people sort of become unhappy because they are under pressure and because they are underfunded.;N
What The Post found was that 17 percent of FAA employees in general, only 17 percent, said that they trust FAA management.;N
And that 61 percent disagreed with the statement that the FAA ``is committed to employee concerns.'';N
That is far and away above, I would think, the average and, to me, is a very dangerous situation.;N
I won't get into general aviation and what you are going to do about it, but I sure will when we have our hearing next week.;N
I won't release it or use it, and I won't use it in this Committee, but I would like to know.;N
Visits by you are nice, the pay is already there, and the discontent is huge despite all of this.;N
It may have to do with the uncertainty of the history of the FAA in recent years because we keep cutting their budget and asking you to do more, as passengers and airplanes increase.;N
But I would like to have from you to me a confidential letter in which you open yourself up to what you think will be required to change those numbers around.;N
Mr. Sturgell, Mr. Gros, as you know, Minnesota is the home of a proud airline history, with Northwest Airlines, Sun Country, the childhood home of Charles Lindbergh.;N
I just wanted to follow up a little bit what Senator Thune had been talking about, about the FAA's role in any merger approvals.;N
Are there any examples you have of past mergers where the FAA stood in and said there is such a reduction of employees that this leads to safety concerns or that changes have been made that lead to safety concerns?;N
I also want to follow up on some of the questions about delays and that 2007 was the worst year for delays.;N
As you know, I am supportive of funding the modernization program in any way we can and to figure out how to ramp this up.;N
But given what we have going on right now, some experts have said that congestion and delay is, in large part, due to the scheduling of flights during peak morning hours and evening rush hours.;N
Do you think that if the carriers voluntarily cut back on their flights during that time, we are going to see a decrease in congestion and delay?;N
What do you think would be a good remedy for this in our current situation before we do the modernization?;N
One of the things I have heard is that if you put these caps on, it is going to cause major carriers to cut back on some of the less profitable routes.;N
Because I have heard there are some concerns that you have some rate, a high rate, of people leaving once they start, or the job isn't what they thought and it is not working out.;N
Are they placed right in hub airports, or are they allowed to go to smaller airports first, or how does that work?;N
As I have paid attention in the news, I don't think that most Americans have put all of these stories together.;N
July 11, 2007, a jet came within 100 feet of a taxiing jet while landing in Fort Lauderdale.;N
January 2, 2008, a jet had to abort a landing in order to avoid hitting another jet in Houston.;N
January 11th, a jet came within 1,500 feet of a taxiing jet while landing at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson.;N
January 16, 2008, two jets came within 600 feet of each other vertically in the airspace above Newark.;N
I have a horrible fear that something dramatic and tragic is going to happen, and I have a sense of urgency about this.;N
And I would like to give you a minute to try to put into words what sense of urgency you have.;N
And while we have had a--I get your point that the serious incursions decreased last year, we have had a 12 percent increase, and we are now near the record high of 2001, isn't that correct, in overall incursion incidents?;N
I take it from your answer that you do think fatigue could be a contributing factor or is a contributing factor.;N
Well, if controller fatigue is on the NTSB's Most Wanted List and GAO has cited fatigue as a major issue, I know--and this has been covered by some of the other questioning, but I want to make sure that I get your commitment.;N
There has been a recommendation that you work collaboratively directly with the air traffic controllers association.;N
And I want to hear your commitment that you are willing to work directly with the air traffic controllers association to deal with this issue of fatigue.;N
Because the impression that I got from reading all of the backup material for the hearing today was that you had not been willing to work one-on-one with the controllers on this particular issue, as NTSB had recommended.;N
And what you are saying is that is no longer the case, that you are now willing to work with them one-on-one on this issue?;N
You certainly come to this position with an impressive resume with your many years at the FAA, as well as having had experience in all sectors of aviation, both commercial and military.;N
Mr. Sturgell, and I want to reiterate some of the issues that my colleagues have raised, most specifically my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, with whom I have joined to introduce the passenger bill of rights as part of the FAA reauthorization that, regrettably, is stalled on the floor of the Senate at a time in which this legislation should be moving forward.;N
Pivotal moments, of course, facing the aviation industry and certainly the FAA with a complexity of problems, it is unfortunate that this legislation has stalled.;N
It is the bottom line, it is the minimum standards that we ought to assert that the industry ought to meet.;N
I mean, they have had the opportunity for almost a decade now with the Voluntary Agreement back in 1999, where they would set minimum standards for passenger services.;N
I mean, whether it is food and water and minimum time where they have to stay encamped on the plane on the tarmac, that hasn't happened.;N
And given the fact that it hasn't gotten better, I mean, after we saw what happened even in December.;N
And I always maintain the amount of money people pay for passenger tickets today, they don't get much in return in terms of customer guarantees that they are going to get what they paid for.;N
They face endless delays, certainly not much food on the aircraft, and not necessarily going to get to where they want to go.;N
So what is the problem with the FAA insisting, requiring the industry to meet these minimum standards?;N
I understand the states of Washington, New Jersey, and Arizona are in the process of also adopting some type of passenger bill of rights.;N
So, first of all, I would be interested to know, in your position, whether or not the FAA would honor those laws that are passed by individual states.;N
And third, whether or not you are prepared to accept a certain standard and requiring that of the industry?;N
We have given the industry, I think, a lengthy period of time, almost a decade, to follow through on these commitments, and I think these are basic issues that the industry ought to be able to comply with.;N
I mean, we all experience many frustrations at the airports, but you really have the opportunity to witness firsthand the desperate situations that so many airline customers are faced with.;N
And even the Inspector General said that the Voluntary Agreement of 1999 has been ineffective.;N
Even in the hearing that was held here in the Committee, he testified that things have only gotten worse.;N
So I don't see what the hesitancy is on the part of the FAA to assert certain standards ought to be the minimum we would require the industry, given the amount of money, given the investments that the U.S. taxpayer makes with respect to the aviation industry.;N
I mean, there is no question that the Federal Government makes an enormous commitment to the aviation industry.;N
So I think we do have an obligation to ensure that they are operating consistent with the rights of passengers.;N
So I hope that we don't make this a complex issue because it should be basic issues, whether it is on food or water or the limited amount of time that they should be required to stay on an airplane if it is delayed and they are sitting out on the tarmac.;N
But we also know there is overcongestion and the way in which these airlines have scheduled their takeoffs.;N
That it is clear that the way the airlines are scheduling today and the way they are operating it only is a prescription for disaster.;N
So I hope that we can--I hope that you in your leadership position can assert that leadership in making sure that it is accomplished.;N
Well, I appreciate that because I think the FAA is at a point in time where you are facing a confluence of events.;N
And bureaucratic nature is not going to be helpful to the process at a time you know the complex problems.;N
But we have got some systemic and fundamental issues that have to be addressed, and certainly the FAA reauthorization initiative is very important.;N
And even in my State of Maine and both the city of Portland and Bangor, I mean, Bangor has seven certified controllers and four are able to retire today.;N
They are not able to retire because that would leave three of them, and there are four pending trainees.;N
And yet there are not a sufficient number of trainees available to prepare so that they could retire.;N
So that is another major issue that I hope that you are going to be addressing during the course of your tenure in an aggressive way.;N
Finally, I know that--I gather that you have been part of this process evaluating what will be done in the New York metropolitan area with the three major airports and providing a cap.;N
And obviously, from the perspective of my state and depending on airlines being able to go in and out of those airports, are you considering the impact on smaller areas and non-hub communities, for example, in terms of that cap and the allocation of slots?;N
So can those--can my commuters in Maine be assured that they won't be negatively affected or adversely or disproportionately affected, I should say, with respect to those caps?;N
I mean, smaller communities oftentimes are on the short end, and yet they are contributing taxpayers and deserve the right to have access to major airports and consistent airline schedules.;N
But I do think the FAA does have a responsibility because every state should have the opportunity to have some access to major airports because there are only so many major airports, and you have to fly there.;N
It is not just simply a private responsibility since the taxpayers are financing much of the aviation industry and infrastructure that depends on it.;N
So I would hope that we would make sure that smaller communities and rural communities and states are considered in the context because it is only fair.;N
Because there have been so many times where there have been proposals that would have adversely affected smaller communities and states as a result of the effect of those proposals.;N
I thank you for your patience, and I thank Mr. Sturgell and Mr. Gros as well for continuing to stay with us.;N
We discuss population for posts filled, and there is always a disagreement, or as long as I can remember there is a disagreement, between the number of full-performance controllers and trainees and so forth.;N
And when we examine the record and we look back at a time when I had the opportunity to talk to Madam--to the Administrator Blakey and I asked a question about working conditions with air traffic controller workforce, there hadn't been any negotiated agreement with the representatives of NATCA, and Ms. Blakey said, ``I think the effect of the work rules and pay that we put into place in September did cause an uptick in retirements last fall.'';N
I think it was a negative reaction on the part particularly of some of the controllers to that.'';N
One of the questions that has arisen, Mr. Sturgell, is the management and the morale of FAA, and you were part of that management, very frankly.;N
But in Sunday's Washington Post, there was a story that said about 14,857 controllers on the staff as of late December, 11,000 were certified controllers, or 74 percent of the workforce.;N
in 2000, we had 12,576 controllers, as contrasted to 11,026, when there is a lot more activity now than there was then.;N
They were the fully certifieds out of 15,153 controllers in 2000, about 83 percent of the workforce.;N
"Now it is being said that we have 11,026, compared to 12,576; 74 percent of the workforce are fully trained--";N
And yet we can't seem to get an agreement from you, Mr. Sturgell, that says that we have got to do a heck of a lot more than we have.;N
Because there has not only been substantial retirement, but departures for other reasons, including the changes in the work rules.;N
And I would like you to respond specifically to these comments made in the GAO report and in The Washington Post.;N
I have a question about what we have done to provide the safety mechanism that we should have.;N
And it says here in the GAO report, ``FAA is not following its order issued in 2002 that directs the Office of Runway Safety to coordinate and monitor activities throughout the agency to ensure that runway safety goals are met.;N
The absence of coordination and national leadership impedes further progress on runway safety because no single office is taking charge of assessing the causes of runway safety problems and taking the steps needed to address these problems.'';N
Well, the report, the order, was issued in 2002, half a dozen years ago, and it sounds like we are still trying to play catch-up.;N
That is the total cost of the New Jersey and New York Airspace Redesign project, do you know what that cost is going to be?;N
I will tell you what I would appreciate, I would ask you to submit it in writing to me, please, so that we have it for the record.;N
Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for your patience, the opportunity to review all of these questions, and we thank the witnesses for their participation.;N
You have heard the frustrations of the Committee on delays and such, but we all recognize that you are not Superman.;N
And so, though we may be requiring you to do the impossible, we just hope you can do the best.;N
And at this point, I think we should be thanking you and the agency for making the air transportation in the United States the safest in the world.;N
I will be submitting a few questions, technical ones that I wanted just for clarification.;N
I'm grateful to the Chairman for asking me to chair this hearing so that we might have the opportunity to present these nominations to the floor as soon as possible.;N
We know the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department is extensive, ranging from development of telecommunications and information policy issues to the state of fisheries and the oceans, and the Department is launching many challenging initiatives in all of the areas of its expertise, including NOAA.;N
Her presence is required at the mark-up of another Committee where I should be, also, but she's asked the Chairman to introduce her statement in the record and it will be introduced in the record.;N
So I would like to begin with you, Ms. Claffee, to be nominated to be the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce.;N
So it's just not possible, but I'm heartwarmed by your comment about your father and look forward to working with you.;N
Our next witness is Dr. William Brennan, Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere at the Department of Commerce.;N
As one who sort of is involved with the oceans, also, I welcome your experience and your know-how to this position in NOAA.;D
We look forward to working with you and I will recommend to the Chairman that we try to have a meeting of the Committee and report these nominations out so they might be confirmed just as quickly as possible.;N
I am delighted to be before the Committee to introduce a friend and a fellow Alaskan, Vice Admiral Thomas J. Barrett, who is President Bush's nominee to serve as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation.;D
I have known Admiral Barrett and his wife, Sheila, since my service in the Alaska State legislature, back in Juneau, when Admiral Barrett was serving as the Commander of the 17th Coast Guard District.;D
At that time, I had an opportunity to come to know Admiral Barrett, his wife, his family, just as genuine Alaskans.;N
Now, I must tell you, they hail from other parts of the country, but we have adopted them as Alaskans.;N
We know that their heart--when they left the state, a part of their heart was left with us, and we are glad to call them Alaskans.;N
Admiral Barrett has a very distinguished background: graduated from the Coast Guard Officer Candidate School, was commissioned in 1969, served in Vietnam, earned a law degree from George Washington, graduated in residence from the Army War College.;N
He, as I indicated, had served as the Commander of the 17th Coast Guard District in Alaska, but, again, responsibilities and duties all over, including the Office of Chief Counsel, the project staff for Outer Continental Shelf Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection.;D
I was able to introduce Admiral Barrett at a hearing, just last year, when he was named as the first Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administrator for the Department of Transportation.;D
I had the opportunity to deal with him on some very difficult issues, but found a man who not only knew his background, but was an incredible administrator, incredible leader, and greatly appreciated that service.;D
He has continued to hold that post as the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator while simultaneously taking on the duties as the Acting Deputy Secretary of Transportation.;D
When he contacted me to let me know that he had been nominated by the President for this, I told him that I had some mixed feelings.;N
I didn't want to lose him and all the focus that he had given in his capacity, but he assured me that he would remain committed to all that we had been working on, while, at the same time, stepping up to assume the responsibilities as Deputy Secretary of Transportation.;D
I have every reason to believe that the 40 years of service that he has provided to this country will continue to be built upon in an exemplary manner.;D
I am delighted, this morning, to introduce Admiral Barrett and to recommend him for confirmation as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation.;D
Senator Olympia Snowe has asked me to announce her very strong support for the nomination of Mr. Brubaker, in light of his service to the citizens of the State of Maine.;D
Unfortunately, because of scheduling conflicts, she cannot be with us, but she urged me to convey her regret in not being able to attend this meeting.;N
In addition, Senators Warner and Webb, of Virginia, have submitted statements in support of Mr. Spoehel.;D
I don't think I need to mention to our witness that my state depends upon air transportation more than any other state in the union.;N
Well, I even challenge that, Mr. Chairman, because we have 241 villages, 70 percent of our areas can be reached only by air year round.;N
We have more general aviation per capita than, I think, anywhere in the world, and yet we have to rely upon this type of transportation, the unscheduled planes that fly food to our villages, and medical service.;N
They do every single thing that taxis and buses and trains do in what we call the ``South 48.'';N
So I think rural air service is absolutely essential to our State, and I hope you have been to Alaska.;N
So we are proud to be part of that activity of proving new technology, and we want to hasten the advent of new technology.;N
But we want to preserve the ability to continue to have these small aircraft fly and fly safely for our people.;N
So I look forward to working with you, and I really thank the Chairman for having this hearing.;N
I think that it is essential that that one spot that you will occupy be filled as quickly as possible.;N
Mr. Hewko, I have been reading your background, and I think that we should congratulate you for being willing to leave the very interesting position you have had to take on this very serious and difficult job.;D
And I am interested in particular that you were a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, your time that you spent overseas.;D
I am sure you have seen the difference between traveling in Europe and traveling in the United States.;D
I like to remind people that my State alone is larger than Italy, Germany, France, and Spain.;N
So that is at least five times the area that Europe deals with on their daily transportation that we deal with, very complex mechanism, but one that has to be improved.;N
New technology will give us the opportunity to decrease the spacing between these large planes that now land at better than 100 miles an hour.;N
And I do think that a person with your background will have the ability to take a look at this situation and see what can be done now.;D
We get increasing complaints, I am sure you know, from the public, the traveling public as far as these delays and the failure to be able to handle some of the things that happen these days.;N
Have you had a chance to be briefed as far as your activities as far as the transportation side of your job as compared to the international affairs side of your job?;N
Well, how much do you feel that your task will involve international affairs as compared to domestic affairs?;N
Have you had any occasion to study the European systems of regulation of traffic as compared to ours?;N
I do hope you will take a chance to learn something about that before you make judgments concerning the activities of rural general aviation and what it means to this country.;N
That is why we would like to have you visit Alaska and see some of the places that small planes serve.;N
In days gone by, it was the dog sled in summer and walking, literally walking--it was in the wintertime when my first partner walked from Nome to Fairbanks, when he wanted to move to Fairbanks.;N
But we now rely on general aviation in such ways as I am becoming too redundant here and now, but I do hope that you will take time to understand general aviation before you make decisions that might affect us in the international area.;N
The record will show that Mr. Hewko has filed all the necessary documents, responded to all, and I think people should read your record.;N
Without objection, this matter will be referred to the full Committee on Thursday, and at that time, I am certain it will be approved and reported to the Senate.;N
I have worked with many of you over the years in this very committee room, spent a number of years I think on the perch right next to Senator Nelson.;N
So we appreciate the good work that you all do to promote particularly sensible science and scientific integrity.;D
And Dr. Jane Lubchenco's career has essentially been built around those kinds of principles.;D
But when you look at her extraordinary track record, I think it is fair to say she is the bionic woman of good science.;D
For example, she has already served as scientific advisor to two different administrations.;D
She served President Clinton, for example, for two terms on the National Science Board, and she was part of the National Academy of Sciences in a climate change report to President George Herbert Walker Bush.;D
So I think all of us who have toiled on this climate change issue understand it is not exactly for the faint-hearted.;N
You are going to have to be bipartisan, and Dr. Lubchenco has already shown with her previous service and the respect she won in two different administrations that she is a very up to that.;D
At Oregon State, Dr. Lubchenco has had the opportunity to confront many of the issues that NOAA is going to face on a daily basis.;D
She has worked to bring her conclusions home, again advising policymakers of both political parties.;D
``She has shown that while science should be excellent, pure, and dispassionate, scientists should not sacrifice a right and must not ignore the responsibility to communicate their knowledge about how the earth is changing or to say what they believe will be the likely consequences of different policy options.'';D
So we have in Dr. Lubchenco somebody who has been driven by the effort to dispassionately find the facts.;D
She has been named one of the most highly cited ecologists in the world, and as I mentioned, for her great record, she has repeatedly been recognized.;D
She is such a valuable asset and has won so much respect from scientists across the philosophical spectrum and policymakers that we would not give her up unless there were a chance to come to the aid of our country at a critical time.;D
Everyone in this room understands that if we are going to make enduring changes in climate change, they are going to have to be bipartisan.;N
That is what Dr. Lubchenco's career has been all about, and it is why I come before you today to give her a recommendation this morning and look forward to her serving in this critical position.;N
Senator Wyden, I greatly appreciate your very kind remarks, and I value the time that you took to come here today.;N
I am here with the love and support of a wonderful family, and I wish to thank my 91-year-old mother, a pediatrician, my late father, a surgeon and Army captain for enabling their six daughters to pursue their dreams while instilling in each of us a strong sense of values, family, love, and heritage.;N
I am very pleased that my husband Bruce and my son Duncan are able to be here today, and I am grateful to them for their continuing love and encouragement.;N
And my thanks to my wonderful staff and colleagues in Oregon and around the country for their overwhelming support.;N
I first became enamored with the oceans during a college class in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.;N
Little did I realize then that life in the oceans is also essential to human well-being and prosperity along the coasts, as well as inland.;N
I lead a large team of scientists studying the marine ecosystems off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.;N
We focus on understanding how the ecosystem is changing and how society might recover and sustain the jobs, recreational opportunities, healthy seafood, and wild beauty that all depend upon healthy ocean ecosystems.;N
I have spent my entire career focused on connections, the connections between land, sea, and air and the connections between people and ecosystems.;N
I would bring to NOAA a firm belief that science should inform, not dictate decisionmaking, a deep respect for multiple points of view, a wealth of experience leading complex projects and organizations.;N
And I believe that these experiences have prepared me well to serve the Nation by leading NOAA.;N
It is an indispensable partner with the private sector in creating jobs along the coasts and inland.;N
It is a trusted steward of a bounty of marine and coastal resources, and it is the premier Government agency for applied science.;N
Working with you and using the best available science as our guide, here is what I think we could do.;N
We can add hundreds of millions of new dollars to the economy by bringing back fisheries, both commercial and recreational.;N
We can improve fishing and farming, lower insurance rates, and make air travel safer by improving weather forecasting.;N
We can spur the creation of new industries, for example, by improving climate forecasting to enable better decisions about infrastructure, public safety, and consumer needs.;N
And we can protect and recover the bays, beaches, rivers, and oceans that amaze, inspire, and connect us all.;N
My vision for NOAA is strongly colored by the experiences I had traveling around the country with the Pew Oceans Commission doing public hearings in many coastal communities.;N
The consistent theme that we heard from CEOs to fishermen's wives, from farmers to coastal residents was the same: an intimate connection between people and oceans.;N
Now our country must rise to a new challenge, dealing with the impacts of a changing climate.;N
I have heard firsthand from business leaders and elected officials about the urgent need for better information about likely local impacts of climate change.;N
From concern about droughts and sea level rise to changes in the chemistry of the ocean, there is a real hunger for more and better information.;N
If confirmed, I will work to create a National Climate Service similar to the National Weather Service within NOAA.;N
NOAA is the best agency in the Government to synthesize the scientific data on climate change and create products and services that can be used by the public to guide important decisions such as where to build a road or a wind turbine.;N
This idea has been studied by the agency, by the National Academy of Sciences, and by this committee.;N
Some of the challenges I know well: ending overfishing, anticipating the consequences of climate change, preparing for natural disasters in a time when resources are tight, restoring ecosystems on which we depend for food, water, livelihoods and other challenges I am just learning.;N
If confirmed, I would work hard with Members of this Committee and the Senate and the House in realizing the great potential inherent in NOAA.;N
Together, we can provide America the best climate change science, restore her oceans' vitality, and recharge our economy, putting us on a path to sustainability.;N
My first question is administrative basically, but I think it was said by Senator Wyden--and I think all of us who have served on this committee agree that we have been bipartisan and we have been very strong for science and technology and research.;N
My question to both of you is, will our Committee, every member of our Committee, minority as well as majority, be able to call your offices for help within your agencies with data that we might need?;N
In other words, will you answer questions and give the same type of help to every member of our Committee?;N
Let me just say a couple of things that are very important to me in the experience that I have had on this committee.;N
Number one is the great need that was shown in the report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' for more research into the basic sciences to stay on top of the fields of the hard sciences and, second, the encouragement of teaching and recruiting young people to be interested in taking the courses in middle and high school so that they will take the courses in college, which I think you addressed somewhat.;N
But in the National Science Foundation, for instance, the social sciences have become I think a fairly large part, sometimes taking away from the hard sciences.;N
And I hope that we can know where our needs are and our priorities right now, and that is to stay on top of the innovation and technological advances that have kept our economy strong through the years.;N
Second, my colleague, Senator Nelson, and I have been very interested in NASA and space, and the fact that we are going to have a gap of 5 or 6 years when Americans will not be able to fly into space is not acceptable to us.;N
And I would like to ask Dr. Holdren if you are committed in your position in the White House to perhaps having the National Space Council revived where there is a policy focus on the concerns that we have about our space flight gap, as well as the ability to use the Space Station for basic research, which was a function of Senator Nelson's and my authorization of NASA that we did designate a part of the Space Station as a national laboratory so that there could be more research influx from outside agencies, which has begun to occur.;N
Let me just say--and I do have a question for Dr. Lubchenco--that I would add NASA in there as well for the capabilities to use the Space Station and other areas of basic scientific research that can be done best in space, as you are prioritizing.;N
The other issue that I have--for the past two Congresses, I have introduced legislation to increase weather modification and mitigation research.;N
My original bill was to put it in NOAA because I thought that would be the better place for it.;N
I did not get anywhere, and it was suggested that perhaps we should put it in the White House to be in the science office, the OSTP.;N
My question to you is--I really think it should be in NOAA with support from OSTP, but here is my question.;N
There are today 14 agencies of the Federal Government overlooking, overseeing, and promoting research into climate change, which clearly means there is no focus and no strategy that has really brought us into what I think is a cohesive policy.;N
But mitigation and modification has really not come to the forefront, and with the violence in weather that we see, which has certainly hit my State, has hit Senator Martinez and Senator Nelson's State very hard--we just saw it in Oklahoma last week--I believe it is time for us to step back and say is there something that we are doing that is making a difference in this violence of weather or is there something we could do that would affect it, either pro or con.;N
For instance, is there something that could be done to lessen the impact of a hurricane when it is still out in the far miles of the ocean away from land, or is there something that could be done in tornadoes, or is there something that is happening when we actually do weather modification in cloud seeding in one area that makes an avalanche occur in another area?;N
But it seems to me that if we are going to look at climate change, weather mitigation and/or modification should also be something that we try to do research on to determine if there is something that can be done or if something is done in one place, would it affect another place.;N
And I would ask both of you to address if you think this is worthy, where you think it would most likely reside, and would either of you be willing to help work on something that would move this priority up in the climate change arena as well.;N
I have to say of all the nominees by the President for his Cabinet or for White House appointments that I have interviewed, Dr. Lubchenco is the most engaging and qualified.;D
And I had a delightful meeting with her, and I have absolutely no questions of her because with all the ones I asked her yesterday she was spot-on.;N
But Dr. Holdren, who I am sorry I did not get the chance to meet with, in your opening statement made a statement that hits at the heart of the discussion we had yesterday, Dr. Lubchenco.;N
But it is really important because we are so concerned that opinions overtake facts, and the next thing you know you are making decisions based on an insight but not really sound scientific evidence.;N
Well, I appreciate that answer, which is very much similar to the answer that Dr. Lubchenco gave me yesterday.;N
And I look forward to working with you and with NOAA when we deal with these issues that affect my State or really our region, because most all these are interstate issues not intrastate issues, to make sure we are always getting the best scientific evidence we can to dictate the right policy that affects the people we represent.;N
Picking up on the Ranking Member's questions--and by the way, Mr. Chairman, I am really excited to be the chairman of the Science and Space Subcommittee.;N
I am really very excited about the quality of nominees that we have in front of us, and I am very heartened by their answers.;D
Now, just following up on Senator Hutchison's comments about changing weather, we might not be able to change weather, but we can sure try to track weather and more accurately measure it.;N
I have the privilege of chairing that Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee as well, and I want to work with you on that to see if we can smooth this out.;N
Now, Dr. Holdren, I was really very heartened to hear your response to Senator Hutchison about the National Space Council.;N
Just for the record, I want it established that then-candidate Obama clearly came out and stated that he wanted to reactivate the National Space Council within the White House.;N
Do you want to say any more for the record here about that in addition to what you have said to Senator Hutchison?;N
Well, that is great because one of the failings in the past--and not just with this immediate past Administration, but previous ones--is that NASA becomes the handmaiden of the Office of Management and Budget.;N
And that is not the way to set policy by having some green eyeshade person over there determining what the policy is, whether we are talking about NASA or NOAA or whatever it is.;N
But that is the way it has been in the past and, therefore, another reason at the high councils of high Government policymaking to have such a council right within the White House.;N
And how are you going to coordinate with others that get into energy and climate change policies, such as Carol Browner, Dr. Chu, Nancy Sutley, as well as the NOAA Administrator?;N
By the way, Dr. Lubchenco, also in accurately measuring the weather: that also directly affects NOAA in having the assets that it needs in space to measure the weather and preventing a potential problem of the increased accuracy.;N
This is a problem that we now have on the paths of hurricanes on that single-point failure: if the G-4 airplane is down for maintenance or because of an accident, there is an issue of having some backup there.;N
You said at the end of your statement, Dr. Lubchenco, that you want to create a National Climate Service within NOAA.;N
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and let me tell you it is a real pleasure to join the Committee and I look forward to working with you and the other members of the Committee on issues that are vitally important to our Nation and the world.;N
I wanted to offer to Dr. Lubchenco and Senator Isakson the opportunity to do their scuba diving trip in the Florida Keys where I think you will find an incredible natural resource in our marine sanctuary, as well as at the Dry Tortugas where the NOAA people do a fantastic job of keeping an eye on that valuable resource as well.;N
For the last two Congresses, I have been working with others in trying to advance legislation that would promote a national hurricane research initiative to improve the understanding of hurricanes, as well as the forecasting and preparedness.;N
This came from a recommendation, a report by the National Science Board, which I would commend to your reading.;N
It would marshal the resources of various Government agencies and research universities and private sector partners to improve knowledge of hurricane intensity, storm surges, and observation.;N
The whole concept is that if we know better not only that it is coming next Tuesday but how strong it is going to be or what the surge with it is going to be, because oftentimes we find that much of the damage, as we know in my colleague, Senator Vitter's State in New Orleans, is the sea surge that sometimes does the greater damage, not the wind damage.;N
Would you commit to improving, Dr. Lubchenco, our ability to do the research and perhaps to encourage this type of legislation that would give you the ability to do better forecasting on hurricanes?;N
We need to work on mitigation efforts as it relates to hurricanes because I think the damage could be greatly reduced if we do the right preparation.;N
And while passing accolades, I think the National Hurricane Center in Miami, by the way--those folks do a tremendous job.;N
There are certain times of the year when those of us who live in vulnerable areas like Florida stay pretty much glued to what they have to say.;N
We have had some issues in Florida relating to fishing quotas, and it is an area where sometimes a lot of controversy arises because sometimes the research does not match up with what the experience seems to be on the field, if you will.;N
It is an area where I hope perhaps you will attempt to put some common sense into the science to ensure that we are doing what is really best.;N
We want to protect the different species, but at the same time, a lot of people depend on fishing for a livelihood whether it is related to commercial fishing or simply tourism and enjoyment.;N
And we have run into some conflict there over the recent days, and I wanted to highlight that to you and commend it for some analysis and study on your part.;N
I do not know that I want to take sides on that because I am not a scientist, and I know I want the resources there for my grandchildren, but I also want to make sure that when I hear complaints that sometimes seem to be based on common sense that we are not putting the practical aspects of this ahead of what might be on a scientific notional basis wrong.;N
With respect to the National Climate Service, having been in the Executive Branch, there is a certain reality, and I do not know how one frees themselves from the clutches of OMB.;N
I never could manage that at HUD during the time that I was there, but I wish you well in that to both of you.;N
But the reality is that when you look at initiating something like a national climate service, what is going to suffer or what is going to be--in other words, how do we make that work?;N
I can understand that, but I do not want it to be at the expense of the other work that is so very important that we are doing with weather today.;N
And Dr. Holdren, in the moment I have remaining, I just wanted to tell you that I worked with a number of other colleagues here on the America COMPETES Act, and I think it is a terribly important initiative.;N
I believe that our competitiveness vis-a-vis the world is one of our real upcoming challenges which goes beyond climate and other issues, but it really has to do with human capital.;N
I have been involved also on the issues relating to immigration, and I think as we look forward to some sort of sensible immigration policy for the future of this country, that we also should look to human capital and how we can utilize the immigration laws--sensible immigration reform that our country so desperately needs--to ensure that we are not just utilizing it as a means of promoting family reunification, but we also view it as a way of improving our competitiveness in the world and as a natural resource in terms of human capital.;N
Thank you very much, both of you, and thank you for serving and thank you to your families.;N
And then I have some general questions based on your testimony, which I want to follow up.;N
Let me do additional follow up to that with respect to specifically Alaska, where the Alaska community has made a position to ban it.;N
With waters off the shores of Alaska, with respect and understanding to where Alaska is and the communities--and there is no question in my mind we have the most sustainable fisheries in this country.;N
So how would you look at Alaska and their aspects of what they have done in making that determination or that decision?;N
I think in the past you have been on record at least with previous administrations utilizing the Antiquities Act to close large areas in the Pacific area.;N
And it is not required that there be a NEPA or that even stakeholders are part of the process.;N
And how do you see ensuring that there is a process clearly with stakeholders and a NEPA-like or a NEPA process to ensure that there is a good scientific evidence that is on the table?;N
I should announce, incidentally, before I call on Senator Snowe, that both Senator Hutchison and I read the FBI checks on these two distinguished folks, and it is some of the easiest reading I have ever been through.;N
And I want to welcome our two distinguished witnesses, both of whom are steeped in peer-based, sound science which we certainly welcome because so much of the credible science is going to dictate some crucial policies in your respective fields and jointly when it comes to climate change.;N
So the expertise and experience and background and qualifications that you both bring to that endeavor is certainly going to be helpful to those of us as policymakers and especially in some very contentious debates.;D
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to working hard on the issues before this committee facing this Congress.;N
I know there is a lot to do from the reauthorization of the FAA to the digital TV transition, to helping our captive shippers, something that I know you care a lot about.;N
I look forward to chairing the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion.;N
I note, Dr. Lubchenco, that everyone keeps inviting you to go scuba diving off the coast of Florida and other places.;N
I could only invite you to go scuba diving in Lake Superior, which would be slightly chilly.;N
In fact, you may have heard I, for 2 years, served on the Oceans Subcommittee being the only non-ocean Senator on there, but Lake Superior is very important, and the Great Lakes, to that Subcommittee as well.;N
And the economic and environmental challenges to our Great Lakes continue to mount on a daily basis, from the depletion of commercial fishing, something Senator Snowe mentioned off the coast of Maine, to health concerns posed by contaminated seafood, to the local effects of global climate change.;N
They got up slightly last year, but overall they have been at an all-time low and it is believed that is because the ice has melted more quickly.;N
So the water levels have gone down and our barges are having trouble getting in and it is less economical for commerce.;N
Up in Duluth, we have had many invasive species that are decimating the lake's ecosystems and damaging with both commercial and recreational activities.;N
And the harbor and open water infrastructure that used to manage these problems continues to deteriorate with age, something I am sure you will hear about as well from Congressman Oberstar over on the House side.;N
I believe the work of NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory is essential to properly sustain the Great Lakes' ecosystems.;N
And I wondered your views about addressing the ongoing environmental initiatives being handled by the Great Lakes laboratory.;N
And you also indicated your support for the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA.;N
As I noted, we really have seen a lot of changes because of the climate change issue, and they are very different than the sea levels rising.;N
The invasive species issue is something this Committee has grappled with, and we would really like to do more on that.;N
And many of these species enter our waters through the ballast water discharged by ocean-faring vessels as they enter U.S. ports.;N
We have had some disputes about getting this done, and I really believe we need to be pragmatic and get something done on the ballast water issue.;N
And I know with Senator Cantwell's leadership with the work that she has done with oceans, and the Chairman's leadership here, I am hopeful we will be able to get something done.;D
As you know, there has been some pending legislation about ballast waters that has been sitting around for a while.;N
I hope with our Subcommittee on Innovation and Competitiveness, we will be able to work with you in the future as well.;N
Well, I would call ``seems almost certain'' a prediction, but that is just a difference of opinion.;N
Has all of that dramatically reversed so that this almost certainty has, obviously, been averted?;N
In 1986, you predicted that global warming could cause the deaths of 1 billion people by 2020.;D
In 1973, you encouraged a ``decline in fertility to well below replacement'' in the United States because ``280 million in 2040 is likely to be too many.'';D
Well, since we are at 304 million, I am certainly heartened that you are not sticking to the 280 million figure.;N
But much more recently, namely a couple weeks ago in response to my written questions, you did say on this matter ``balancing costs and benefits of population growth is a complex business, of course, and reasonable people can disagree about where it comes out.'';N
I am scared to death that you think this is a proper function of Government, which is what that sentence clearly implies.;N
In 2006, obviously pretty recently, in an article, The War on Hot Air, you suggested that global sea levels could rise by 13 feet by the end of this century.;N
Now, in contrast to that, the IPCC's 2007 report put their estimate at between 7 and 25 inches.;N
You would still say--I think you did--that 1 billion people lost by 2020 is still a possibility?;N
I too look forward to working with you in your capacity as Chairman of this Committee and working with you on the Oceans, Atmosphere, and Coast Guard Committee.;N
I am sure my questions may be seen as a little more specific to the Pacific Northwest region, but I hope you will indulge me because I have many.;N
Obviously, the Columbia River salmon biological opinion has come a long way, but not without a lot of court intervention.;N
So I guess I would like to start with: do you think that poor management within the Government led to those court interventions and decisions?;N
And what would you do to avoid that same--what would you change under NOAA to make sure that we do not end up in the courts again?;N
How confident are you, though, that you can keep us out of the courts by having a strong management response, as opposed to punting and then having the courts decide?;N
A second issue which you and I have had a chance to talk about in my office is obviously the impact of hurricane-force winds off the coast of Washington, and we have had quite a bit of damage from this in the last couple of seasons.;N
The Puget Sound Partnership is an innovative collaborative effort in the Northwest I think you are familiar with.;N
It is an eco-based management approach to our fisheries and ecosystem and ocean governance.;N
If confirmed, would you put resources toward this kind of effort in helping Puget Sound on its recovery plans?;N
Obviously, NOAA has already--basically it said that it believes that it can take this from an endangered species to a delisting of the species back to levels, they think, from maybe 28 years ago.;N
So if confirmed, under your leadership, what kind of resources do you see dedicated to delisting that population?;N
Last year the Coast Guard Commandant testified before our Subcommittee that as far as resources, he thought that we had inadequate resources to respond to oil spills in the Arctic.;N
And I want to know if either of you believe that our Government has the capability to effectively respond in the Arctic Ocean and what the Administration can promise us that we will be doing to better protect that area.;N
Holdren, maybe you can help me on a technology piece here--is as a freshman Senator how you appear at three different hearings that are scheduled simultaneously.;N
One of the areas that I am very interested in that the President has proposed is the creation of a chief technology officer that I believe will be reporting to you.;N
I think it was one of the things that led us to being named the best-managed State in the country.;N
As you look at the CTO position, do you see it more as an internal function working with the CIO at OMB to bring about greater technology and efficiency inside the Federal Government, or do you see this as another kind of outreach officer to spur innovation across the broader technology community?;N
How about, though, the role--I understand the CIO role, the CIO role mostly focusing on the IT space, but as you think beyond IT, how you bring technology functionality to internal workings of Government, would that be CTO or CIO?;N
and recognizing it is a new position and it could have quite a large brief--I would hope that you would look at those States who have maybe gone before.;N
I think actually Senator Cantwell's State, Washington State, has been active in this area, but there may be lessons learned.;N
But what is critically important to Virginia and the surrounding States is the health of the Chesapeake Bay, and NOAA has played an important role in that.;N
It seems like over the last 25 years, we have been partners with NOAA and we oftentimes have not even met the thresholds that we would have hoped to have met.;N
I would argue that at least in recent years, the District, Virginia, Maryland, and States in the bay watershed have actually stepped up with financial resources in fairly substantial amounts.;N
I guess what I would ask is, recognizing you are not even confirmed yet, but do you have a sense of what additional authorities beyond just funding that NOAA might need to be a better partner with the States on restoration of the Chesapeake Bay?;N
For example, I know there is a bay monitoring program involving a series of buoys out throughout the bay that seems a little undermanned at this point.;N
But if you could just speak to that specifically, if you have any knowledge, and then generally about the bay.;N
I would simply add that as the Nation's largest estuary and one that still remains in great jeopardy, I do believe the States in the state compact have stepped up their game over the last 4 or 5 years, both in terms of water standards, in terms of runoff, in terms of funding.;N
But we have not had a collaborative partner at the Federal level, and we look forward to having that kind of collaboration going forward.;N
Senator Begich then has a follow-up question, and then I will have a statement to make before we conclude.;N
This is not part of your responsibility, Dr. Holdren, but I judge you to be of such a high caliber that I know that you will accept this responsibility.;N
I think one of the greatest embarrassments in the United States of America is the fact that we have an air traffic control system which is analog.;N
The consequences of this are overwhelming because if it were to be solved, it might clear up delays by 30 percent or more.;N
What I am saying to you is that we have a President now who seems to be enormously interested in technology and efficiency and doing things in the right way.;N
We have tried in our committee to do this, and we can never get the money because of various reasons.;N
I do not know if the President is aware of this or not because I have not talked with him about it, but I just hope very much that you will.;N
But as I sat here listening to all the questions, most of them relevant to your positions and the issues of what you are talking about, Arctic policy is going to be huge.;N
And I would just be interested from your perspective--I am a very visual person, and I am afraid to ask this question because I am afraid of what the outcome will look like.;N
But how you see and whom you see will be involved in the decisions of Arctic policy into the future by agency, so a very visual chart for me would be very helpful.;N
I am afraid to ask for this because I am afraid that every Department division of the Federal Government now believes they have a role in it, which is great, except it will be probably the most disorganized effort.;N
So I would be curious at some point if you could provide to me, whichever one of you that would be the most appropriate, a chart of how you see and what agencies you see--because I know there are jurisdiction issues.;N
How do you intend to make sure that agencies like NOAA have adequate say in our Government's policy choices, especially as it relates to offshore drilling?;N
In a letter commenting on the EIS for the Chukchi Sea oil and gas drilling plan, the National Marine Fisheries Service wrote the Minerals Management Service analysis did not present a strong enough case to NMFS that the marine resources would be adequately protected.;N
Yet, this advice, along with similar advice from EPA and Fish and Wildlife Service, was ignored by the Minerals Management Service.;N
So what do you intend to do to make sure that these agencies who are in charge of protecting these resources are heard on these important issues as it relates to offshore drilling?;N
Well, one area in which I think we need to better understand the response is on the Office of Response and Restoration for oil spills, and we certainly have not funded that program at the level of the President's request.;N
What do you think the impact of that is on cutting back on our Nation's oil spill response capabilities?;N
I want to thank Ms. Tenenbaum for being here, and I also want to thank Senator Rockefeller for asking me to chair this today.;N
We are on a relatively tight timeframe because we have a vote scheduled on the Senate floor at 11:45 a.m., so what I'd propose, with my colleagues' indulgence, is that I'll do a very brief opening statement.;N
If she wants to do an opening statement, that'd be great, and then I'll introduce our introducers, and then we'll let the nominee speak.;N
And then we'll try to keep our questions to 5 minutes, if at all possible, because we'll try to move through these.;N
We understand there are several Senators on the way, but they've encouraged me to get started, given our timeframe this morning.;N
I knew that we were in pretty good shape when, the day she was announced, we had several consumer groups, as well as several business groups, come out in support of her.;N
State Senators, and we all know--on this Committee, we understand the trials and tribulations of the CPSC over the last few years.;N
I think--just in layman's terms, what has happened is, the CPSC has had its budget cut, and its resources dwindled as its challenges have increased.;N
And when we saw this huge influx of products that were manufactured overseas, most notably China, but from a lot of places overseas, the CPSC just, quite frankly, was not able to keep pace with that and was overwhelmed.;N
Unfortunately, since that bill was passed, there has been a lot of controversy about the implementation of that.;N
So, Ms. Tenenbaum, assuming that she is confirmed, which I don't think there's any question about that at this point, based on what I know, she will inherit a lot of things that she has to get in order, and things to fix, and we are very delighted that you're here.;N
So, until Senator Hutchison gets here, if I may, what I may do is introduce Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for a statement.;N
It's a big honor for all of the people in South Carolina to have Inez nominated for such an important job.;N
And I call her ``Inez'' because everybody that knows her feels very comfortable with her as a person.;D
The Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission really holds a public trust, and I can assure you that the American consumer and their families are going to be in good hands with Inez at the helm of this very important public-;N
We had the fastest advancement of any State in the Nation, in terms of national testing among our student population, and that was a real desire of hers, to make sure that our students improved.;N
And at the end of her tenure, our State was recognized as having the most rigorous academic standards, assessment, and accountability system in the Nation.;D
You know, in education you can devise a test for the teachers, or for the students, and a lot of people, you know, make sure that everybody does well on the test.;N
She produced, I think, the most challenging test in the Nation to evaluate our students, and the goal is to bring out the best in the students of South Carolina.;D
Rigor will be applied to the products coming online that will be put into the free market, and I just could not think of a better person with the executive experience.;N
She has, like I say, been around politics most of my life, and is the type of person that--Sam's life too--she's the type of person that everybody, whether you agree with her or not, respects, and this is a job where the American consumer needs to understand that they have somebody on their side.;D
The only blemish on her record I can see is that she has a Bachelor of Science and a Master's from the University of Georgia.;D
But, all joking aside, I remember what last year was like, what this Committee went through, and Inez Tenenbaum has the exact experience we need and, more than anything else, the heart for what we need here.;D
She will look out for the American public, and she will give the American people the leadership they deserve.;D
My only reservation in endorsing Inez is that that endorsement might hurt her with this Committee, so I hope that----;N
She is a serious nominee for this position, who has dealt with all of the issues in a large, controversial, public agency in South Carolina, and did that with professionalism and style.;D
And, as some of you know, she and I were in a hard-fought race for the Senate in 2004, and I was very excited to hear about the nomination.;N
There's absolutely no reason that we can't move her through in a hurry, and put her at the helm of this agency, which as the Chairman has pointed out, has a lot of challenges.;N
Senator Graham, you're certainly welcome to stick around, but we understand you have a very heavy schedule.;N
No, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to hear from her, and then I will incorporate my opening statement into my questions.;N
We appreciate your interest in public service and your willingness to take on this agency and all its very, very important tasks and responsibilities.;N
For the Senators who have just arrived, it looks like we have a vote scheduled for 11:45, unless somebody tells me that changes.;N
And what I'd like to do is have everyone submit their opening statements for the record, and just dive right into questions.;N
I think it's fair to say, and I think most people would agree, that there is an issue of morale at the Consumer Product Safety Commission right now, just for various reasons, and--could you talk a little bit about your management style and some of the things you would like to see happen at CPSC? ;N
I mean, I think you need a little bit of time to get your feet wet and get our bearings there at that agency.;N
So, as issues present themselves, I'm sure the Committee would appreciate hearing from you on various things, whatever they may be, challenges, successes, whatever they may be.;N
And I think it's probably a good idea, maybe, for you to come back to the--either the Committee formally, or have a meeting informally with us, say, in--I'll just say 60 days after your confirmation, to give us a sense of how things are going.;N
And if there are specific issues that are still out there, maybe we can talk about those in detail once you're there.;N
I was very pleased to have a meeting with Ms. Tenenbaum last week, and I was very encouraged with her talk of her record of working with the South Carolina legislature in her position as head of education in the State.;D
However, there are some glitches, as often happens with legislation, and some areas where there have been differences of opinion about the intent of some of the language.;N
"First is the required question that the Ranking Member always asks, and that is that our committee has always worked well with staff in the agencies, and the heads of agencies; and when we are developing or proposing legislation, we need their technical expertise.";N
And my question is, can all of our members of the Committee count on being able to call in to your agency for the expertise that we might need to help us draft legislation, or to exercise our responsibility in oversight?;N
Well, one thing I think our committee probably will need to do is have a hearing on the Act that we passed last year, to see where the kinks are, and see where we need to do some technical corrections.;N
We discussed some of the unintended results impacting thrift stores, charity sales, small businesses, and you used the word ``common sense'' in your description of what you think is right in the enforcement arena.;N
So, I would ask you if you think the law gives you sufficient flexibility for the common sense enforcement that I think we agree is the right standard?;N
And where do you think it doesn't give enough flexibility, and the law is clear, even if it is pretty hard to enforce?;N
Where you have found that a business needs more time to comply with the law, do you think the stays of enforcement are sufficient, or do you think we need to revisit, maybe, that area of the law to give more flexibility, again, when a business does need more time?;N
Or, in the situation with the youth ATV vehicles, where there needs to be some other approach.;N
We, in our professional life here, have a chance to meet candidates for office that are recommended, and it's so nice, very frankly, when we have someone who is here, presenting themselves to the Committee, who have the kind of background that you have, which is, I think, perfectly suited to taking the responsibility that you're about to take.;N
News reports have shown the popularity among children with toy guns that look like real AK-;N
As a matter of fact, in some instances, young people have been killed by police officers who believe, because these guns look so realistic, that they're holding a weapon, and the consequence is terrible.;N
In 2007, we had something like 11,000 injuries from toy guns, whether it's in the production of these things, or whether it's the way the parts are put together.;N
But last year--you were discussing morale a moment ago with the Chairman--I sent a letter to the CPSC asking it to investigate this issue, but I never received a response.;N
Now, I'm hoping that, with your confirmation, that you'll work with me to review the safety of these guns.;N
Last year, I met with a New Jersey family whose daughter was severely injured due to a crib that collapsed.;N
Oddly enough, my wife's daughter, my step-daughter, had a baby, and she's just turning a year old, and I was with her this weekend, and she was chewing the paint off the crib.;N
And even though these things are lead free, I don't think it's very healthy for children to have paint chips in their system.;N
Now, under your leadership, will the CPSC require cribs to be tested so--to prove that they are durable and will not collapse under pressure?;N
Despite the high number of recalls on children's products, consumers rarely return recalled products.;N
As a matter of fact, it's only--it's estimated that only 5 percent of the time do they do so.;N
I hope that you'll increase outreach with the--with a full complement of staff so--to make consumers aware of the recalls of dangerous products.;N
pretend for the moment that you are Chairman, and that you will look to see that, when there is a recall, that a reason is produced for doing so, and that you'll do your best to alert the public to the importance of accepting a recall and returning the product.;N
You've really covered a lot of my concerns with the current law, and words like ``common sense'' encourage me.;N
It seems, perhaps, not beneficial--and, Inez, you and I have talked a fair amount about this law and whether or not we need legislation.;N
But, just one comment that goes under the umbrella of common sense is, that the goal is more safety, not more regulation.;N
And the problem we often have is--we develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme, that tends to favor large companies who have contingents of lawyers and people who can deal with them.;N
And in this country, there are a lot of small manufacturers of a lot of products, a lot of small toy manufacturers, and handmade toys.;N
And some of the law has been interpreted in a way that would make it very difficult for these companies to do the type of testing that would be necessary to comply in any way that they could afford to do it.;N
And I would just ask you, as you look at this, is to remember that the whole point of this is not to run small companies out of business.;N
But, if we have such a heavy regulatory scheme, it may be very difficult for them to afford the tests that are required to comply.;N
There are often other ways to do that, such as, make sure the components are tested, not necessarily the final product.;N
But, I would just appeal to you to do everything you can to make sure that we make our products safer, but also keep America a good place to make products.;N
And, you know, one of the former, I think, most memorable, Chairmen of this Committee, Fritz Hollings, is a great fan of yours.;N
And I figure that anyone who has earned the admiration and respect of Senator Fritz Hollings, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Jim DeMint is the person of great ability.;D
And the ability to bring people together and to win their respect, means so much in the role that you're going to play.;D
But, I just want to make sure you know that it was in the 1980s, when I came to Congress, that all of our regulations were based on protecting a 155-pound man.;N
If you go--if you protect a 155-pound man, a healthy man, it's going to be good for all those guys who are in that category.;N
But, the vulnerable folks--the children, the pregnant women, those with disabilities, and so on--are not protected.;N
And I think that was our goal when we wrote this law that you are going to find yourself in the middle of, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.;N
So, I guess that my one question is, can you assure me that, in your work, that you will put the children first?;N
We'll all be protected, and yet you're going to do it in a way that allows responsible companies to make good products and sell those products.;N
And I'm just so excited about your nomination, and extremely pleased at the bipartisan support you've received thus far.;N
I know this is kind of a chorus we're hearing from both sides, but I want to add my strong support of Inez.;N
As I've had the opportunity to work with her in politics, I've had the opportunity to work with her when she did such a great job in education in South Carolina.;D
And I think you are absolutely the right person at the right time for an agency that has truly been troubled.;N
looking around this room, there are a series of other distinguished South Carolinians who are here to show support for you.;N
I hope you're not paying all of them, because some of them are, you know, pretty expensive, high-priced folks here in town now.;N
I know, I think, when the Chairman was initially talking, as we came in, he had raised an issue that he has played a leadership role on, along with Senator Landrieu, Senator Martinez and Senator Nelson, from Louisiana and Florida, respectively, and that's this Chinese drywall issue.;D
I can tell you that the stories that we heard with some of the folks who've been victimized by this, almost Kafkaesque tragedy, was pretty remarkable when we had them in recently.;N
I want to make sure Virginia continues to be--because we've been hit down in Hampton Roads on this issue.;N
They were saying, ``We're doing the testing, but we still don't have enough money or resources to do it in a timely manner.'';N
And in effect, these people, who are living in these virtually worthless homes at this point, were basically told, you know, ``We think it's tough, we understand it's challenging, but you've got to continue to live in these places where you could be creating a health hazard for yourself and your children.'';N
And, Inez, the thing that was most remarkable--afterwards, a series of the families came out and talked to me about the fact that some of the inspectors had stopped going in and inspecting in person, and instead were simply soliciting the information over the phone, because the inspectors were finding, just coming in and spending an hour or two in the home, they were starting to get some of the ill health effects, in terms of finding shortness of breath and finding, breaking out and other bad health effects.;N
And it was just amazing to me that our Federal Government was then saying, ``We don't even want to send our inspectors in to do this, we want to do it over the phone.;N
But, by the way, if you have the misfortune, having done nothing wrong on your own part, to be living in one of these health hazards, we have no recourse for you.'';N
So, from my colleagues, you're hearing other issues of great concern, but this Chinese drywall problem is an enormous, enormous challenge.;N
I hope you will continue to also press to make sure that we can work with you to find relief for these families.;N
And if there is legislative solutions that need to be taken, I know the Chairman has moved aggressively on this issue.;N
I just want to add my voice--we'll be there to do all we can to make sure this issue is brought to full and speedy resolution.;N
I'm sure you've been briefed on this a little, but if you've got any comments about the Chinese drywall issue, I would love to hear them.;N
a lot of this is taking place in Louisiana and Florida--they have different climate issues, in terms of humidity, than folks we've got in Virginia.;N
And it's remarkable to me that the testing and finding the cause is taking this long, when it's evident from the families, and then again even from the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff, that you start to feel the ill effects, literally just being exposed for a few hours.;N
And as you do the additional testing--and I can just speak from the Virginia standpoint, but I'm sure my other colleagues, who've got other different weather conditions--;N
simply testing it in the Florida- or Louisiana-type humidity issues--we've got humidity in Hampton Roads, but--in Virginia Beach and Norfolk--but, probably not quite as much as they've got in certain areas in Florida--make sure that you've got other States involved in those tests, as well.;N
Mr. Chairman, one thing I'd simply add--and I know my time's up, but--and you heard from both of our colleagues from South Carolina--the one thing that Inez is famous about is, when she gets a hold of a bone, she doesn't let it go until she figures out an answer.;D
And I can't think of a better person, on a host of these issues, to take them on in this new, important role, than Inez Tenenbaum.;D
And, third, I had the privilege of chairing the Georgia Board of Education in the late 1990s, when you became Superintendent of Education in South Carolina, and I watched what you did in South Carolina, and I want to say that everything that Senator DeMint said was absolutely correct.;N
You did a marvelous job and demonstrated the kind of attitude somebody at the CPSC should have to deal with the difficult problems.;D
This is--the Chinese drywall situation is one of any number of product problems coming out of China.;N
We obviously can't pass laws that regulate production in China, but we have gateways, which are our ports, and we have a Commerce Department, and we have a CPSC.;N
And I think, somewhere along the line, if you get the chance, a task force of representatives from the ports, Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, and the CPSC, can possibly come up with some ideas of a threshold of entry that could give us some degree of protection, or at least send a signal to the world that we are looking at the quality of the products that are coming in.;N
Second, I co-sponsored Senator DeMint's legislation dealing with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which I voted for, and Chairman Pryor spent a lot of time on, but it did have a lot of unintended consequences.;N
One of my daughters-in-law, the mother of three, all under 5, chairs the largest second-hand clothing sale and second-hand book swap in the history of mankind, I think, but it raises a ton of money for their church.;N
When that law passed, within weeks they were called by their attorneys and told to cancel both those sales because of the potential effect and legal liability that was put on them as a second-hand seller of a product they neither manufactured nor took any responsibility for.;N
But, I hope you'll apply the same due diligence you did in South Carolina education to that particular subject, and try and get it to where the unintended consequences are not so onerous for people, for whom it was never intended.;N
I had quite an experience down there at Representative Clyburn's fish fry that I will never forget, and you were certainly a gracious host, thank you very much.;N
You and I have talked already about the toy safety and the children's product safety bill that was so important to me.;N
But, now I look back on how some of these problems, which I feel very deeply--in my State--we have the two biggest domestic manufacturers of ATVs and snowmobiles in Minnesota, Polaris and Arctic Cat.;N
And when I look back at it I think, one, it would have been good to have had a more collegial relationship with the agency, in terms of working together when these problems came on the scene.;N
Two, as the legislation was drafted, I think it would have been helpful to work more proactively with the CPSC.;N
The handmade toy lines actually got its genesis in Minnesota, and you've already answered some questions on working with them.;N
We just, this weekend, had 1,600 ATV riders decide to ride in a line to break the Guinness Book of World Records, in Silver Bay, Minnesota, to have the longest line of ATVs--I know you're jealous, Senator Pryor.;N
"But, the question that--I specifically have right now, because, of course, this day was much appreciated; I don't think any of the Senators thought that the law was going to be applied this way.";N
And that--again, you're going to be on a judicial body--quasi-judicial--that'll be deciding this.;N
But, what's happened right now is that, as of July 12, the ATV, snowmobile, and motorcycle manufacturers have to submit to the CPSC a report that lists each component part that is made of metal and is accessible to children.;N
Because the CPSC is supposed to issue a final rule on accessibility, and what's accessible, on August 14.;N
So, there's this lag where they're supposed to give all their parts, but they don't know what's accessible til August 14.;N
And so, what they're trying to get is some kind of an extension so that they can find out what the CPSC defines as accessible, before they go through these hundreds of parts that they'd list.;N
And just so you know, the ATV industry strongly supported this law because it had some good safety standards that would apply to foreign manufacturers that had already applied to domestic, and that's the irony of this.;N
They supported this, and it was interpreted in a way that I don't think any Senator, anyone, expected.;N
The Virginia Graham Pool Act is something that I also worked hard on, after we had a tragedy in Minnesota with Abigail Taylor.;N
And there, with Senator Pryor and others, we were able to get that done a few months after this tragedy happened.;N
And I just wanted to just say to you, we know the CPSC can't enforce it on every little pool all over the country, every public pool, but we also know that the education efforts will be very important here.;N
Because we've found, in our State, we have had no incidents since this happened, because, of course, it hit people's hearts so much, so the pool operators are all going out and making sure things are in better shape.;N
There are serious health symptoms, and yet people don't know exactly what the health bottom line is.;N
Also, there's major damage to the home, such as corrosion of piping and wiring, which brings up fundamental safety issues with gas lines and the like.;N
In Louisiana, it's sort of triply tragic because, by definition, these are folks who were flooded by one of our hurricanes, Katrina or Rita or Gustav or Ike.;N
So, by definition, virtually every one of those folks were hard hit by a hurricane or just recovering and have finally put their house back together, and then they discover this, and they have to start all over, and their house is a loss, sometimes a complete loss, yet again.;N
I'm certainly continuing to work with Senator Nelson, Senator Landrieu, and many others, on legislation and on funding, which has the CPSC studying this issue on a more accelerated timetable, to study three things in particular.;N
"Number one, the relationship between the drywall and health symptoms; so, what's the bottom line on health, number one.";N
Even with these funding assurances, even with a study ongoing, the word is it's taking months and months.;N
What can you tell us about the current plan at CPSC with regard to the timing of this study?;N
Well, my understanding is that, even with everything that's been done, and funding commitments for CPSC to focus on this immediately, it's going to be a matter of many, many months, which strikes me as really frustrating and inadequate.;N
I appreciate that, and I look forward to following up with regard to that specific timetable, because right now, it's on a very frustrating multi-month timetable.;N
What are your thoughts about focusing on this Chinese pattern, to really get some significant new results across the board?;N
And, Ms. Tenenbaum, you can give the answer for the record, because I don't want to hold everything up.;N
I strongly believe that one of the problems is that in the past there has not been enough common work and coordination among multiple involved agencies, like the International Trade Commission, Customs, USTR, and your soon-to-be agency, working together for a practical result.;N
For instance, in this Chinese drywall situation, at the end of the day, if the only action is some sort of class-action suit against some shell entity in China, which is really some arm of the Chinese government, that goes into litigation and takes years and years more, that's not a solution.;N
Really, what has to happen is for this to be a priority of the U.S. Government, including USTR, CPSC, and everybody who deals regularly with China, to get a practical resolution, and have the victims reimbursed in a whole and a quick way.;N
And I just ask, for the record, your responses to that idea, and how would you work toward that sort of practical, bottom-line result.;N
I was wondering if I could ask you about emerging products that are associated with hazards.;N
In 2007, the Commission established a pilot program for an early-warning system on emerging products and associated hazards.;N
And my understanding is that that system uses subject-matter experts and electronic assessment tools to allow the Commission staff to quickly identify these issues and propose corrective action.;N
I guess that's what I was getting at, is whether, in principle, that approach helps the Commission to be more proactive than completely reactive.;N
And should the Commission be proactive when it comes to emerging safety issues in consumer products?;N
Several of the unforeseen issues the Commission has had to address in implementing the Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvement Act involve smaller businesses, and--do you think the Commission is well positioned for conducting outreach to smaller consumer product manufacturers?;N
I know the Commission leverages its staff by using standards committees and organizations, like the Underwriters Lab and ANSI.;N
But does the Commission also leverage its relationship with the Small Business Administration and other agencies within the Department of Commerce, like NIST and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership?;N
I know--I understand interested parties can submit petitions to the Commission that can ultimately lead to rulemaking.;N
And do you have any sense, or any thoughts, on that, the amount of time that it takes or how the Commission does that as it initiates its own rulemaking?;N
And are there some of these things that are just going to get delayed anyway because of the level of staffing?;N
Well, thank you, Ms. Tenenbaum, I appreciate your answers, and I appreciated our meeting and your past experience at the State level.;N
I think your nomination is such a wonderful development for this very, very important and neglected part of our government.;N
The tenacity you have shown in your career, and your willingness to take on projects against the odds suits you very well for the challenge that you've accepted.;D
And I hope that--I'm sure many of your visits in front of this Committee will not be as pleasant as the one today----;N
I will say that it's very important--and I know you've discussed this in other questioning, and I know that your answers have been exactly what I was looking for--but I think the problem we've got with the legislation that we passed is the confusion and uncertainty.;N
And you combine that with a failure to embrace the notion of common sense, and our phones ring off the hook.;N
And--I mean, when I've got women that I revere that are librarians crying on the phone to me, I know that something is amiss, because I don't think government should ever make librarians cry.;N
So, I want to make sure that I convey to you how much I hope your common sense takes firm control of this situation, and that we quickly move toward very clear guidance, so that if there are any remaining issues that we need to go back and take a look at, that we can do so.;N
Let me give you an opportunity to speak to that just briefly, if you would, Ms. Tenenbaum.;N
And I--on behalf of the librarians, and the great thrift-store operators, and the wonderful folks that hunt, with their ATVs, in Missouri, I thank you for that.;N
Let me, if I may--our vote is on, and let me just have a couple of follow-up questions, if I can, or follow-up observations.;N
One of the things Senator Lautenberg talked about was, he had written a letter to the CPSC, and he never received a response.;N
I don't know if this is true, but anecdotally I've heard, and I hope it's not true, that there was favoritism shown to Republican inquiries, as opposed to Democratic inquiries, and I certainly hope that wasn't the case.;N
But I would definitely hope that, as long as you're Chairman, you'll be very politically neutral when it comes to communicating with House, Senate, Attorney Generals, Governors, whatever the case may be.;N
The Chinese drywall case is an illustration of how much easier it is to fix the problem before it comes into the United States.;N
And now, with that Chinese drywall--that is in houses, it's ruining houses, and it has ruined their value.;N
If we could have gone back a few years in time, and if we had an inspector there, if we had an office there--you mentioned that--if we had someone there to say, ``No, that cannot come in to the U.S.,'' just think about how many millions and millions of dollars people around the country would have saved.;N
Another thing I want to say before I close is, I think, when we talk about librarians and ATVs and other matters that we've talked about today, thrift stores, et cetera--I think that what's happened--what you can see is, is--when the agency runs properly, it can help resolve these issues before the industry gets to a chaos point.;N
But, I think, in the last few months, what you've seen is, with some actions of the agency or individuals there, or whatever the case may be, statements made by them, you saw almost a panic in a lot of sectors of our economy, with people not knowing what to do.;N
So, I think that dose of common sense that people have talked about, and that spirit of cooperation, and working together to resolve this and get to a resolution that's good for everybody, I think that'll be a great breath of fresh air.;N
And that is, the Chairman, who is Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Hutchison, the Ranking Member, have asked all Senators to get their questions for the record in today by 6 p.m.;N
That's good news for you, because that means what they are hoping is, we'll be able to move this nomination quicker.;N
And, Ms. Tenenbaum, we really, really appreciate your interest in public service, and your willingness to take on this Commission.;D
And we look forward to working with you as you're the Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.;N
Mr. Chairman, I do have an opening statement, but I would be happy to let Senator Schumer introduce the nominee.;N
First, I want to thank you, Ranking Member, all the members for giving me the honor to introduce Julius Genachowski, one of my former staffers and good friends, before he is confirmed to be Chairman of the FCC.;N
In fact, after his New York upbringing, he went to college and then I hired him right out of college, and he worked for me long and hard.;D
I have been blessed with a dedicated and hard-working staff, but Julius will always stand out, thanks in large part to the work ethic that his family instilled in him.;N
His parents, Azriel and Adele, are in the audience today, and I have had the pleasure of knowing them.;D
They can speak volumes about the adoration they have for Julius and his brothers, Joey and Alan, who are also here.;N
And I would like to say hello to his wife, Rachel, and his three beautiful children, Jake, Aaron, and Lilah.;N
I remember that Julius demonstrated a passion for consumer rights from the day he came to Congress.;D
And one of his signature issues was working on what is now called the Schumer Box, which is what is on all credit card applications.;D
It should have been called the Genachowski Box, but his name was too long, so they put mine in.;N
And I know he is going to carry that dedication to consumer rights to his role as FCC Chairman, should he be confirmed by this Committee and by the Senate.;N
In addition to working for me, he served on the House Select Committee on the Iran-Contra affair.;D
Of course, he has had extensive knowledge of the FCC, where he worked as special counsel to General Counsel William Kennard, who later became Chairman and then to Chairman Reed Hundt.;D
The FCC has been a passion for Julius for a very long time, and it is so nice to see him nominated for the position he knows so well and cares so much about.;D
His resume in the public sector demonstrates a widespread knowledge of agency experience, and it gives him a well-rounded background on all the issues that are before the FCC.;D
And he has a great deal that he could--he is a modest fellow, but he could boast about his private sector work, which demonstrates his understanding of where the Government rubber hits the tech company road and how those two entities must work together to shape the future of telecommunications.;D
He was a special advisor for General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm, and most recently, he co-founded both LaunchBox Digital and Rock Creek Ventures, which helped to advise, launch, and accelerate tech companies in their early stages.;D
So Julius is creative, knowledgeable, and respected, probably as creative, knowledgeable, and respected a nominee that the FCC has ever seen.;D
He knows that telecommunications in an economy that is fundamentally based on interconnectivity is instrumental to job creation and entrepreneurship in the U.S.;D
The President knows that Julius has the ability to harness telecommunication technology, to shape our country's initiatives from health care to education to energy, and that is why he chose Julius to serve as Chairman of the Technology, Media and Telecommunications Policy Working Group that created the Obama technology and innovation plan.;D
So I could not think of a more well-prepared nominee, someone who cares more about the agency, someone who has more qualities that will make him live up to the strong and appropriately high challenges that you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Hutchison, have laid before him.;D
I am very pleased, after meeting with him and just his focus on what he wants to do with the agency.;D
One of my pet peeves is while the agency's website was at one point a really groundbreaking website, I think it has kind of fallen behind and a lot of people complain about access on the website.;N
I was telling him outside that the DTV transition is going, at least in my State--I will not speak for everyone--better than we thought, and that the FCC Commissioner McDowell and I talked about this on Friday, and the Commerce Department have worked together on this.;N
Then, of course, just as the other Senators spoke about, the broadband issue is very important to me.;N
The last thing that we spoke about briefly was something that Senator Warner and I have introduced legislation--and we hope other members of the Committee will look at it--called Dig Once.;N
It is the simple idea that if you are going to be building a Federal highway, a Federal road project, and you want to put in conduit for broadband--and we know we want to do this all over the country--that you should be doing it at the same time.;N
Literally something like 90 percent of the cost of broadband installation is that of roadwork, and you can literally save about 10 times the cost if you simply do it at the same time.;N
It certainly was popular in my State yesterday when they were dealing with the road construction season in Minnesota with all of the orange cones, delays and closed highways.;N
We are very excited for your new leadership at the FCC, and we are excited to be working with you.;D
I will just submit my opening statement for the record, but I want to welcome Mr. Genachowski to the Committee.;N
It is good to see you up there, see you vibrant and strong, and we very much appreciate your leadership on this Committee.;D
I would like to echo also what the Ranking Member, Senator Hutchison, said about broadband, and I think Senator Klobuchar and Mr. Genachowski also mentioned it.;N
If we look at the various points in our history where we were not connected, with the railroads in the 1880s, we made a major investment, and we encouraged railroads to serve the entire country.;N
Then with FDR in the 1930s and 1940s, we realized we were not connected in terms of electricity, and we brought electricity to rural areas with rural electric co-ops.;N
And I applaud Senator Warner and Senator Klobuchar for their bill in thinking through how we put this in.;N
One of the areas I would like you to think about and address in your opening statement is Indian Country.;N
I remember when President Clinton was trying to demonstrate the digital divide, and I think I told this to you in our meeting.;N
And he used that trip from the Silicon Valley to Shiprock, New Mexico out on the Navajo Reservation to show the huge digital divide.;N
So I hope that your leadership there will move us down the road, and this Committee will also step up to the plate.;D
I cannot be here for long today because of some other commitments, but I did want to stop by and offer a few thoughts.;N
First of all, Mr. Genachowski, we have not had an opportunity really to meet or to talk at any length.;N
But I have to tell you, looking at your background and your resume, two things come to mind.;D
You have prepared yourself well for what you are about to get yourself into, which is a job with huge responsibility.;D
Second, it just occurs to me if you are not qualified for this, I do not know who would be qualified.;D
So I really wish you the very, very best and look forward to working with you on a whole range of issues.;N
So many good things have been mentioned, and I do not want to repeat them other than to indicate that yes, of course, for me issues like broadband, broadband in rural areas, and sparsely populated areas, would of course be important.;N
Second, whether we hear about it today--or maybe sometime you can stop by the office--I would love to visit with you about the community advisory boards.;N
There is some concern that, you know, if a local broadcaster does not know the community, who could possibly know the community?;N
I would also like to hear some thoughts at some point about economic growth in rural areas.;N
I do think the Commission is uniquely situated to help us in more rural States, and maybe it is broadband.;N
Maybe there are some other things that we can do together to try to boost economic activity.;N
I always said as a Governor and as a former Mayor, creating a job in Omaha is vastly different than creating a job in a community of 2,000 people that is in a very rural part of the State.;N
The second thing, just to wrap up, Mr. Chairman, I do also want to put in a very strong endorsement for someone who I hope will be your future colleague, and that is, Commissioner McDowell, who will follow you.;N
I think you can create a bond and a working relationship that kind of extends across the aisle, like many of us do on this Committee.;N
Looking at your resume, knowing him better than I actually know you at this point, I just think there is a tremendous amount of brain power that, put to work, can really help our great Nation.;D
Having sat in your seat at one point in my career, I just want to say congratulations, and I would say the same thing to Commissioner McDowell.;N
When we saw what recently happened, the Federal Communications Commission faced a major test when they moved the entire country from analog to digital.;N
This move promises better programming and picture and sound quality for our residents and businesses, and it will free up space for wireless broadband and public safety needs.;N
Despite a slow start and a few delays, I am pleased with how successful the transition was, and I look forward to the benefits that it will bring to those residents of New Jersey who had been, in previous years, out of the quality of transmission.;N
Commissioner McDowell, as well as Acting Chairman Copps, and Commissioner Adelstein, deserves credit for making the transition work.;N
If you are confirmed--and there is little doubt in my mind--and Robert McDowell is confirmed, we expect them to continue the commitment and the leadership that we have seen.;D
We heard from Chuck Schumer about your past experience, and we know that he was very impressed with the kind of work that you did and takes total credit for whatever developments you have had.;D
If these nominees, you and Mr. McDowell, are confirmed, you are going to still have some very critical tasks that have to get attention.;D
We need a plan for a public safety broadband network using some airwaves that were freed up by the switch to digital.;N
New Jersey's only commercial high-powered station, WWOR, has failed to meet its obligation of our State.;N
So we are going to talk to you about that, and I am not sure that we are going to have the time to ask questions and still meet other obligations in my case.;N
The FCC is drafting a national broadband plan, getting broadband in underserved communities, not just the underserved rural ones.;N
It is essential that we continue to help people continue to learn, get newer, better jobs, and keep America competitive.;N
And I look forward to our contact in the future, knowing that we have an able skipper at the helm.;N
Commissioner McDowell, of course, is nominated for a second term, and I am pleased to support him.;D
I think, Mr. Genachowski, you have a perfect background to assume the chairmanship, and I will be happy to vote for you.;D
Let me say, however, that it seems to me you will lead a rather unhealthy agency, and by that, I mean we have been through a period of substantial secrecy, I believe a very difficult work environment and with questions about unbiased policy research studies.;N
Some of them perhaps do not match someone's impression of what should have come out of the studies, so they were not released.;N
Commissioner Copps has, I think, done a fine job in an acting capacity, but we need more transparency, more openness, in policy development.;D
You are going to have to develop a national broadband plan, which is a big, big issue and has so many important considerations.;N
Policies on spectrum, what spectrum out there lies fallow, why, how much of it, why is it not used, what can we do about that, the failed program on forbearance petitions, net neutrality--which by the way, you can solve yourself.;N
We have an active and aggressive debate here in the Congress on net neutrality, but you could actually remove that burden by taking a very significant step in solving that issue and restoring net neutrality provisions.;N
And then there's the issue of public interest obligations and substantial concentration of broadcast properties around the country, and the fact that many of us think that concentration has been very unhealthy.;N
Again, I am pleased when we have nominees come before us who are extraordinarily well qualified.;D
I think that is the case with you, and I am pleased to support your nomination and Commissioner McDowell's as well.;N
I actually had the opportunity to get to know him many, many years ago when we used to play basketball at the YMCA here in town together.;D
Then he stopped playing with me and he started playing with this other guy who now lives down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.;D
He has got a pretty mean jump shot and is someone that I know has a deep friendship with the President.;D
As somebody who at least used to know a little something about telecom, I do think we have a chance--and I also will be supporting Commissioner McDowell.;N
I hope to come back and to be able to introduce my fellow Virginian, somebody I am proud to support.;D
But I do think there is a chance to kind of reestablish the stature and prominence of the FCC.;N
It is a terribly important agency that has a critically important scope of work, and I look forward to working with you.;N
With Senator Klobuchar--her bill is on trying to make sure we think smartly about how we deploy the fiber.;N
But it is also important that we think clearly about making sure that we have got an accurate mapping of broadband capabilities around the country, that we really think creatively about last-mile concerns.;N
Broadband, as you know, does no good if you can bring it to a town hall, but you do not have any ability to get it out around the balance of the community.;N
I think we really need to be creative about how we put incentives in place and help smaller communities, in particular, aggregate demand so they can have a sustainable broadband network, even if the public sector makes the initial investment.;N
We are quite successful on the D block auctions on the 700 MHz space, but trying to make sure that we have that next-generation public safety spectrum that is fully interoperable is, candidly, I think still an embarrassment in this country that this many years after 9/11, we do not have that fully interoperable, full-functioning public safety spectrum across the whole country.;N
It is going to be right on your menu and making sure, again, as we do this analysis of what spectrum exists out there and how we make sure we get it out to the public and, perhaps at the same time, generate some revenue.;N
Again, I have to step away for a minute, but I do hope to get back to introduce my fellow Virginian, Robert McDowell, who I know will continue to be a great Commissioner and a great partner, I think, with Julius in getting the FCC back on track.;N
Thank you for the time that you came and met with me and your commitment to consider coming to Alaska again and see what we are doing up there.;N
But again, thank you for being here and to your family that I know needs to support you in this endeavor, as you will be drawn across the country at times to present, discuss, and have issues brought to your attention that will require you to leave Washington, D.C. at times.;N
So, again, thank you for your willingness to do this, and again, thank you for the time that we spent together going over very Alaskan-type issues.;N
I was going to slap you on the thigh and welcome you back, but I did not know which leg it was, so I did not.;N
Mr. McDowell, I want to congratulate you on your second nomination to serve on the Commission, and I look forward to supporting you also.;N
We have had a chance to chat, and I think you know I support you, but I want to express it publicly.;N
I think you are the right person to lead this Commission at a time of great economic uncertainty, and the experience that you bring from your previous tenure at the Commission, as well as your own private-sector experience, is just the right recipe for the Commission during these difficult times.;D
The FCC regulates, as you know, an industry that makes up roughly one-fifth of the U.S. economy, and I regret to say that the tenure and stewardship, if you can call it that, of your predecessor really, I thought, was a bleak period, a difficult period for all of us at the FCC.;N
I think it is a trail of missed opportunities, of acts of commission and omission that wound up just not taking advantage of the revolution in the communications world and the need to come up with some fundamental policies, not the least of which is just the broadband penetration of our Nation which slipped from something like 4th to 21st.;N
That is not a positive statement about competitiveness or America's preparedness to step up.;N
You are going to have an enormous influence on industries that we rely upon to serve as dynamic drivers for the future of our economy, and we are going to look to you for that leadership.;N
I am confident from what you have said already and from your past that you understand that challenge.;N
Obviously, this hearing comes at a time of great transformation in the way that we are communicating with each other in this country.;N
Just 4 days ago, broadcast television stations completed the digital transition, shutting off analog signals that have delivered air broadcast television to households for more than 60 years.;N
That transition did a lot more than just bring a clearer TV picture into those rooms where people got their box and got ready for it.;N
But thanks to the digital switch, next-generation wireless broadband networks are being built across the country and consumers are going to reap the benefits of that.;N
So when confirmed, you are going to begin to craft the FCC's national broadband plan, and that I think is perhaps the most important task you are going to face as Chairman, given the way we have gone backward and the level of the challenge.;N
As part of that process, I hope you are going to consider taking a look at the way we manage and allocate spectrum, both publicly and privately, in order to see that we use it more efficiently.;N
I have introduced legislation with Senator Snowe and others on this Committee to require the Commission to work with NTIA on a comprehensive spectrum inventory, and I think that such an effort would play an integral role in any plan for achieving universal broadband service.;N
There is obviously no shortage of challenges waiting for you as you enter the Chairman's office.;N
The quarterly contribution rate to the Universal Service Fund is as high as it has ever been.;N
And nearly 8 years after 9/11, shockingly we still have not made good on the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to build an interoperable public safety communications network.;N
So, from addressing these challenges and others, to maintaining the openness of the Internet, which many of us, I think you know, care about passionately, as well as maintaining a laboratory for innovation, I think you are going to see some of the biggest challenges that we have faced in this field, but I am confident that this Commission is up to the task of implementing the President's technology agenda.;N
So we look forward to a swift confirmation and we particularly look forward to working closely with you.;N
We hope that you will commit in the hearings to a strong, candid, and really cooperative relationship with the Committee.;N
For those of you who may be trying to figure out how to pronounce his name, we have had researchers at work for 3 days on that and it is pronounced ``chow'' not ``cowski.'';N
Senator Hutchison, I have great respect for the leadership you bring to the Committee, and I look forward to working with you on the vital issues in the communications area.;D
I would like to thank Senator Schumer for taking the time to introduce me and for his decision 24 years ago to give a young college graduate his first job.;N
Senator Hutchison, I have great respect for the leadership you bring to the Committee, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you on the important issues in this area.;D
I'd like to thank Senator Schumer for introducing me today--and for his decision 24 years ago to give a young college graduate his first job.;N
Senator Schumer sets a high bar for public service, and I am honored to call him a mentor and a friend.;N
I could not be more grateful for the love and support of my wonderful wife, Rachel Goslins, and my incredible children--Jake, Lilah, and Aaron.;N
I'm so pleased that my parents are here, Adele and Azriel Genachowski, and my two brothers, Joey and Alan Genachowski.;N
On the broadband issue, how do you view the issue of no service versus underserved areas as priorities?;N
I just hope that the priority is to help people who have nothing with our stimulus money is really what we are discussing here.;N
But people who have nothing, it seems to me, should take priority over people who have slower service.;N
How do you see that evolving and is it a priority that indecency enforcement policies would be looked at?;N
When I first came to the Senate, I was a person who believed that a newspaper should not have too much television presence in a market because I think more media outlets are a good thing.;N
Since I came to the Senate, the technology world has exploded, and I no longer think that we need to police that.;N
And now we have the most incredible situation, which I do not think any of us ever anticipated in our lifetimes, that major newspapers would be on the brink of literally going out of business, and not having that avenue for news coverage for the citizens of big communities is now a viable possibility.;N
So my question is the FCC does still have rules against dual ownership, and I think it is important that you look at that and determine if really we ought to be doing everything we can to keep newspapers alive in order to have the most outlets for people who like to get their news in different ways.;N
But I would hope you would set it at a higher priority than just waiting for a review period to come up.;N
But I would like to ask you: Do you think it is a good public policy to encourage more minority ownership of broadcast media?;N
Do you have any ideas on what we can do, meaning the FCC or the Congress or whoever, to try to make ownership of broadcast outlets more possible for minority interests?;N
I just think that the public policy goal of a more diverse ownership spectrum is a good national goal that we should continue to try to do.;N
This morning, this Committee had a hearing on Inez Tenenbaum over at the Consumer Product Safety Commission in her confirmation process.;N
She had some really good ideas about how the CPSC can better communicate dangers and recalls and safety and all this stuff to the general public.;D
But one thing that struck me is most of her ideas--not all, most of them--dealt with people having broadband capability so they could receive this type of information from the CPSC.;N
I would like to ask you about the BTOP, the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, in the stimulus package.;N
Do you know much about that, and do you have a sense of how that is going to be administered?;N
And I know you are not there yet, but is your understanding that the FCC is involved in that process?;N
Are you happy with what you hear on that, or do you think the FCC should be more involved?;N
And do you think that program is going to actually get to unserved areas, as Senator Hutchison was referring to?;N
Last, I would like to ask you about something that is important to you as a parent and me as a parent and others in this room as parents and grandparents.;N
Basically when the V-chip bill passed way back when in, I think, 1996, if I am not mistaken, there was a requirement that the FCC would continue to look at technology and see if this idea could be improved upon.;N
This Act that we passed recently in the last year or 2 basically mandated that the FCC open a case on it.;N
I understand you are in a comment period right now, maybe even a second round of a comment period.;N
My question for you is, given your background and all the things that you have done, do you think it is time that we revisit V-chip and not just the technology but the V-chip system that is in place?;D
As Senator Pryor just talked about, I also will be very interested in how you proceed and for the same reasons, as someone who has a young child.;N
If it was not on--I will not publicize one channel, but I will say PBS was the other channel.;N
If it is not on those two, I have no clue what is on the regular shows, unless it is a newscast.;N
Let me, if I can--and you and I talked briefly about this in the Universal Service Fund and how important that is at least for our State, a very rural State and, I like to describe here in this committee, ``extreme rural,'' as other people talk about rural States.;N
The distance, and the travel, and the complexity of transportation to these locations, but also the climate conditions, really create some unique situations.;N
As that moves forward, there will be issues of concern for us as Alaska is identified, if I am not mistaken--it is 100 percent tribal, which gives it some special considerations.;N
I am curious on how you feel about that policy and how tribal land is recognized and how Alaska fits into that.;N
You don't have to be specific, but specifically about that and the reform itself of the USF.;N
And also in Alaska, because our lands are different with the Alaska Native people, there are tribal lands and corporate tribal lands.;N
So sometimes, we have to continue to point that out because our land claim settlement was much different than the traditional reservation settlements.;N
So as you have an opportunity--I know I said in my statement--I did not give you a chance.;N
And I just want to echo that because this will give you a chance to see the value of that program.;N
Currently, they are concerned that they will be excluded from the national broadband plan.;N
In Alaska, because the cost and utilization of satellite is part of the equation, how do you see that, and will you in the broadband plan keep that all in consideration that in Alaska satellites are utilized in a lot of ways to get that more costly connection that may not be able to be done by land?;N
Excellent, because I can tell you they are very concerned, just because, again, the vast distances, the uniqueness of the lack of access to infrastructure, satellites become part of the equation of how we deliver broadband.;N
The good news is, in Alaska, 70-plus percent--we are the highest connected State in the country, which is kind of unusual in its own way and it is because of this kind of relationship we have with satellite, as well as on the ground.;N
Again, for us it is more of a statement just for the record, as our discussion occurred privately, and that is the importance of E-Rate and how we deliver.;N
When we have the No Child Left Behind Act that says you must have a certain type of teacher with certain credentials teaching kids at certain levels, in some schools, we may only have 10-15 people and to have all that specialty is impossible.;N
I just want to reemphasize the importance of that but also hear your support again on the record of how important E-Rate is, as well as the impact it may have especially in rural communities.;N
I know you have been a big proponent in a lot of ways of Alaska issues because you have seen it.;N
Another area is white spaces, opening up broadcast white spaces to fixed wireless and personal portable devices.;N
I know the Commission took a very conservative start in opening up the white space, but it was a start.;N
Will the Office of Engineering Technology make sure that this is a priority issue so that we can have sufficient resources in working with the industry to test and make sure that we are answering any of the technical issues that might come up?;N
If there is a competitive market for broadband service where consumers could purchase broadband from multiple independent providers, would the discussion over the net neutrality change?;N
I mean, the concern, obviously, is not to artificially segment off parts of the population and giving them a higher cost.;N
We talked in my office about the so-called Fairness Doctrine, and as I understood it, you said that you do not support reviving it or policies like it directly or indirectly through localism and that sort of thing.;N
I just wanted to have for the record that I am correct in stating your position, or if you would like to restate it.;N
The good, when we had our bridge collapse and area right in the metropolitan area had done a very good job of interoperability because of our sheriff and others, and then I have seen difficulties in the past and in some of our rural areas with that.;N
It seems to me that is just one of the areas of our Nation's information infrastructure that may continue to elude us, absent some Federal action and Federal involvement in terms of making our emergency services more interoperable.;N
Yes, we had a horrible shooting of a police officer once, before we got better communications in our metropolitan area.;N
Literally, the emergency personnel had seven different phone services and walkie-talkies and trying to talk to each other while they were pursuing a suspect who had killed this cop.;N
I just came from a Judiciary hearing on competition in the wireless market in text messaging and things like that.;N
Senator Rockefeller and I and others have a bill that we will most likely introduce in some form this year about cell phone competition.;N
In my view, this has come a long way from the days when the movie Wall Street and Gordon Gekko had a cell phone the size of a briefcase, and we now have 270 million Americans--18 percent of Americans--do not even have a land line.;N
And yet, while there have been some vast improvements with early termination fees and, having driven around my State this weekend, there are still huge problems with dropped calls and consumer knowledge about what they are buying and if it really works in the areas that they want to drive to or work in.;N
The complaint right now--and this is why we had this hearing--is just concerns about some of the prices right now.;N
You and I talked about this and how it used to be this model of development and innovation, and now it is lagging behind.;N
Now, of course, the question I really wanted to ask when Senator Schumer was here and we could pretend you were under oath--we could do this whole thing--was when he said that the credit card box that he--;N
But I chose not to do that, and because we have had such a nice and a positive hearing, we will not end that way.;N
Mr. Genachowski, thank you very, very much for your time here today and for making yourself available.;N
I know you visited with many of us, if not all of us, privately in our offices, and we appreciate that.;N
I also think something that others have alluded to is very true, and that is, this agency is extremely important and will really benefit from your leadership and your management style there.;D
If you guys would like to stay, you can, but if you would like to leave, that is completely up to you.;N
We are asking all the Senators who have follow-up questions to get those to us by 6 p.m. today.;N
And that is a good sign for you because that means we are going to try to expedite your confirmation as much as possible.;N
So thank you very much for your time, and I am going to call up the second panel, if the Committee does not have anything else.;N
As he is departing the table there, as Mr. McDowell is coming forward with his family, there is going to be a little bit of a change here.;N
Thank you, and I want to thank everybody for trying to do such a quick change there because we had a lot of people that had to come and go.;N
I must say that I hear very, very positive reviews on the things you have done there at the FCC, and I think you have been a very positive force there.;N
If you want to introduce your family and make your opening statement, that would be great.;N
Senator Pryor and Senator Hutchison and other Members of the Committee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.;N
Senator Smith was not able to be here, but he sent a question and asked me to put it to you.;N
His question is this: ``For those of us in Oregon have been trying to attract a baseball team for years, we're envious of the spans (ph) in cities that actually have a team.;N
``I am, however, becoming more concerned about a tactic that cable companies are using to limit viewership of local sports programming.;N
First Cablevision stopped broadcasting of Yankee games until they got a deal they wanted and then Comcast did the same did with the Philadelphia Phillies and in Washington, D.C., with the Nationals.'';N
This is Senator Smith's question, ``I understand the business negotiations can be tough, but blocking game broadcasts raise real concerns.;N
Coming from the private sector, I will first look to private-sector solutions to resolve issues such as that and I would prefer to see voluntary agreements between the parties at hand.;N
There may be ongoing proceedings or future proceedings at the Commission that could examine this.;N
I'm not exactly sure of the Commission's authority in those areas under Title VI, Section 628, for instance.;N
If the Commission can encourage a private-sector solution, I would look for such an avenue.;N
As I mentioned, we welcome Commissioner Adelstein to be with us today, but if you are already confirmed you both couldn't be here.;N
Are you familiar with some of the rules that have been adopted in the past concerning the activities of the Commission?;N
Are you familiar with that rule, particularly about how many Commissioners can be present at any one time at a public gathering?;N
I think we need some opinions on the Commission about what should be done to modernize your procedures so that you can function as a modern body.;N
There was a time in the past when Senator Goldwater and I decided that there were too many Commissioners and we asked the Congress to delete two.;N
Well, Senator, throughout my career I've learned that these issues are not necessarily, for the most part, partisan issues.;N
I have worked in a bipartisan manner as an advocate, and would continue to take that spirit to the Commission with me if confirmed.;N
I've served on statutory boards appointed by two Governors of Virginia that were bipartisan and worked well with folks of the other party, again, on issues that are historically not necessarily been partisan issues, for the most part.;N
You've had a substantial relationship with some of the communications interests and I note in your statement that you indicate that you do intend to very jealously apply the conflict of interest concepts and will disqualify yourself in any matter than you've had connection with before or any entity you've had before.;N
Well, I will certainly rely on the opinion of the Office of the General Counsel of the FCC and they do have a system in place and rules in place.;N
We have a Commissioner recently who came from the private sector, from a regulated company, who ended up only being recused from two particular matters, as I recall.;N
So I will consult with the Office of General Counsel on any matter where Comptel may have been a party or where Comptel's members may have been a party to make sure that there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interest.;N
My primary bailiwick at Comptel for the past 6 or 7 years has been the legislative and executive branch.;N
And my name has not appeared on a pleading in several years, nor have I been formulating or writing pleadings or been substantially involved in any pleadings before the Commission.;N
If they do, I would urge you to respond to them as rapidly as possible because we will also try to get this nomination on the Executive Session agenda for March 16.;N
What I will do now is turn it over to Senator Hutchison who has an appointment that she needs to get to.;N
Tonight I am going to be watching the University of Texas Longhorns in the college world series, and I am asking you right now to consider going to the University of Texas and playing baseball because I know you have a future.;N
I would like to ask you the same question that I also posed to Mr. Genachowski regarding the media ownership rule, the newspaper, broadcast, television station, FCC parameters, and ask if you think that it is time to look at those restrictions in a new light.;N
I said earlier that I have never liked having too much ownership in too few media outlets.;N
I do not think it is healthy, but so much has changed in the last five years, as you stated in your opening statement, and I think perhaps now with newspapers in such dire straits, that lifting some of those restrictions and letting broadcast and newspaper owners have the capability to bring their revenue up so that they can both stay in business.;N
We had an Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on which I am the Ranking Member, but I am glad to be able to welcome and congratulate Mr. McDowell on your reappointment.;N
I look forward to continuing to work with you upon your confirmation on a lot of issues, obviously, many of which have been touched on.;N
National broadband policy, applying indecency regulations--net neutrality has been mentioned--spectrum allocation are just a few of the issues that confront the Commission today.;N
I think the range of issues that you deal with, the importance of those issues cannot be overstated.;N
So it is a very important position, and I hope that we can continue to make some progress on some of these things.;N
I would say and I understand that you have already had a lot of, I am sure, very lively discussion about the fairness doctrine, but I hope the Commission can put a stake through the heart of that thing once and for all.;N
It will certainly reduce the number of amendments that we consider up here if we do not have to deal with the fairness doctrine amendments on appropriations bills.;N
But I do want to ask you about some of the national broadband policies because as you know, the FCC is required by the stimulus bill to develop a national broadband plan.;N
I know that there are grants and loan guarantees in the stimulus bill, but I am just curious as to what your thoughts are about deploying broadband to rural areas of the country.;N
Well, and I know that the Universal Service Fund tends to generate a considerable amount of controversy.;N
The only thing I guess I would ask of you is, as you take these issues on, that you take into consideration the impact on rural areas and making sure that rural areas and the frontier, so to speak, is not left behind.;N
I think there are just some wonderful applications of technology that are leading to incredible increases in productivity and job creation and everything else in our economy, but it is, obviously, going to be very important in my view as we move forward, that we do it in a way that takes into consideration some of the unique and particular needs that rural areas of the country have as well.;N
I want to congratulate Mr. McDowell, and as I said before, I look forward to working with you.;N
It is one of the things that the Chairman is very proud of because of its effectiveness in closing the digital divide.;N
When the Telecom Act of 1996 was passed, only 14 percent of the classrooms in the country and 5 percent of the classrooms in low-income communities had access to the Internet.;N
Thanks to the E-Rate program, today more than 90 percent of all classrooms have access to the Internet.;N
The question would be, do you support the E-Rate program as it is currently laid out in the statute?;N
And do you think that there should be any modifications, either changes or enhancements, to it, or do you think it ought to just stay as is?;N
Speaking of mergers and acquisitions, I know that is one of the things that the FCC does that is very important.;N
When you look at a merger or acquisition in a given industry, there could literally be billions of dollars at stake and there is a lot of capital investment, and you need to consider that aspect of it.;N
You also need to, obviously, look at the consumer and whether the consumer will benefit, but you also, I think, at least should look at the economic impact it will have on given communities because oftentimes when there is a merger or acquisition, one community is a big loser in that prospect.;N
So my question is just a general question, and that is, how do you balance all of those interests when you are looking at a merger or acquisition?;N
At some point soon--I do not know exactly when that nomination will come through the Senate, but it is our hope that we would move your nomination and his fairly quickly.;N
I do not know what all they are, but I know that some of these entities would like to have some finality before the end of the business quarter.;N
Are you going to try to sort of clear the decks now so that the new person does not have to deal with that?;N
We are going to try to wrap this up, but I know that Senator Warner wanted to be here, but because of some schedule changes today in the Senate, he could not.;N
But Senator Warner is a big proponent of yours, big supporter of yours, and he wanted to be here to introduce you.;N
Let me just remind all Senators and staff that we are going to try to have all written questions, follow-up questions in today by 6 o'clock.;N
As I understand it, between the two leaders on the Senate floor, there is no agreement yet on your nomination and the other FCC nomination, but I am sure that Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, and others will try to get these packaged up and moved through as quickly as possible.;N
With that, I just want to thank you for your service on the Commission so far and what you have added to the Commission and to the process.;N
Sometimes it just takes about a year and a half to get confirmed, but that is part of public service, and you are doing good things for our country, and I appreciate that.;N
I am going to do three nominees and Frank, Senator Lautenberg, is going to do three of the nominees.;N
I want to thank Senator Lautenberg for chairing the panel and for his total commitment--he is sort of the founder or keeper of Amtrak.;N
I want to welcome Mr. Scott Quehl, who I just met, the President's nominee to be Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary of Administration for the Department of Commerce.;N
If confirmed, you will be responsible for overseeing the Department's financial resources, human resources, and facilities.;N
With the Department's $17 billion budget, I am confident that your financial management experience will serve you well in carrying out these responsibilities.;D
I am also pleased to welcome Suresh Kumar, the President's nominee to be the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary of Trade Promotion and Director General of the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Services.;N
Also, Mr. Philip Coyle has been nominated to be Associate Director for National Security and International Affairs in the Office of Science and Technology, OSTP, run by a very great man, indeed.;N
I hope, Mr. Coyle, that your nomination will serve to highlight the importance of science in an inescapably globally connected world.;N
I now will turn to Frank Lautenberg, Senator Lautenberg, for any comments he might have, and then we will have introductions.;N
In any event, first of all, let me say that when we see two distinguished Senators, as we have, at the witness table, we can be sure that the people that they are here to acknowledge and greet are well-trained and deserve the opportunity that they have been nominated for.;N
He is really well-qualified, and I want to support his nomination to serve on the Board of Amtrak.;D
The American people and our Nation's passenger rail system will be well served by having Tony on the board.;D
He is the Chairman of the New York/New Jersey Port Authority and has learned an awful lot about transportation and the needs for our region.;D
When I think about families who are making travel plans for the holidays, I also think about the kind of problems that one could have getting through in their means of travel.;N
When America has a vibrant and truly national passenger rail system, there will be fewer lines, fewer hassles and delays because our travelers will have more options.;N
And Mr. Chairman, without your help, it never would have passed, and I am grateful to you for that.;N
I know Tony can help make that law a success and help realize our vision of Amtrak becoming one of the premier passenger rail systems in the world, and I want it done in 5 years from now.;D
As Chairman of the Board for the Port Authority of New Jersey and New York, he has distinguished himself as one of the Nation's transportation experts.;D
With experience achieving those goals in the most densely packed region in the country, Amtrak can be a better-run and smarter operation than it has now, saving more money, carrying more passengers, and expanding service into new areas of the country.;N
And I know that our distinguished colleague Senator Hutchison is very much interested in rail service and promoting that.;N
While at the Port Authority, Tony led the adoption of a $29 billion capital plan that spans over 10 years.;D
The plan is going to help develop a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, expand aviation facilities for our busy region, and rebuild the World Trade Center site.;N
And I was a Commissioner of the Port Authority before I came here, and I have got some sense of what it takes to manage this complex organization.;N
And with Tony Coscia on the Amtrak board, I think our confidence has been boosted that we can accomplish the goals that we would like.;N
I am also pleased to introduce another New Jerseyian, Suresh Kumar, a New Jersey resident who is President Obama's nominee to head the United States and Foreign Commercial Service at the Department of Commerce.;N
The Commerce Department and its Foreign Commercial Service play a critical role in getting America's goods and services overseas and creating new jobs here at home.;N
Especially in these difficult times, that job takes someone who understands government, understands business, and understands how the two can effectively work together.;N
Let me thank you and the Ranking Member for the opportunity to join Senator Lautenberg in joining in introducing Anthony Coscia as one of President Obama's nominees for the Amtrak Board of Directors.;N
And let me take the occasion to salute Senator Lautenberg's leadership on the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation.;N
There isn't a better, stronger, most effective advocate for mass transit in this country, particularly rail transit, than Senator Lautenberg.;D
And he has proven that over his time here in the U.S. Senate and has made the country better as a result of it.;D
I think there is a growing recognition that investing in passenger rail can strengthen our country in numerous ways--;N
creating jobs, reducing dependence on foreign oil, cleaning the air that we breathe and the climate our children and grandchildren will inherit--and I believe passenger rail is an absolutely essential part of solving our transportation challenges.;N
And I am glad that this Administration has taken numerous steps to signal its commitment to this issue, including spearheading a long-awaited high-speed rail network.;N
In short, now is the time to strengthen Amtrak and also provide it with firm leadership as it expands into a central component of our transportation future.;N
Tony Coscia is the right person at the right time to help lead Amtrak as a Member of its Board of Directors.;N
As Senator Lautenberg said, he has, since 2003, been the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he oversees a nearly $7 billion annual budget while managing some of the most critical infrastructure facilities in the region and in the country.;D
Those include the PATH commuter railroad, five airports, four port facilities, six bridges and tunnels, and the World Trade Center.;N
As Chairman, he has worked diligently to ensure the safety and security of the Port Authority's facilities, improve the transportation networks between New York and New Jersey, and spearheaded the agency's new mass transit rail initiatives.;D
He, prior to this work, spent 11 years as Chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, where he worked to strengthen the Garden State's economic base and revitalize communities through job creation and retention.;D
Now I have worked closely with many people, Mr. Chairman, over the 37 years of my public service.;N
I have never seen someone who has the scope of intellect, breadth of experience, as well as someone who can bring people together in common cause to achieve a goal as Tony Coscia has.;D
And he has great management skills to add to that, as well as his commitment to improving the Nation's rail transportation center, as is evidenced by the latest, most significant project we are seeing in the country--a new mass transit tunnel leading between New York and New Jersey, about an $8 billion to $9 billion program that will move literally thousands and thousands of people successfully each and every day.;D
So given his proven leadership skills, I certainly am confident of what he can do for Amtrak.;D
I urge you, Mr. Chairman and the Committee, to expeditiously support his nomination, send it to the Senate for full confirmation, where I look forward to being able to support him on the floor.;N
Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to introduce Bert DiClemente, one of the President's nominees for the Amtrak Board of Directors.;N
He served as a State Director in Delaware for then-Senator Joe Biden for 20 of those years.;D
So he has been a colleague, a trusted adviser to Joe Biden and to me, and a dear friend for a long, long time.;D
I can recommend him to the Committee strongly, unequivocally, and completely without reservation.;N
Bert was named for his father, who worked for railroads his entire career, including at Amtrak, from which he retired in 1976.;N
As long as I have known Bert, he has been passionately interested in railroads and Amtrak.;D
Equally as important, Bert has been intimately involved for almost every aspect of Amtrak for decades.;D
He has been involved with many Amtrak projects, the Amtrak shops, Amtrak management, Amtrak labor issues, especially Amtrak labor issues.;D
He knows Amtrak, and he knows its people--hundreds, if not thousands--its challenges, its strengths and weaknesses very, very well.;D
I can assure this Committee that he will take on these responsibilities with sincere dedication and purpose.;D
He will be an excellent leader and director on the Amtrak Board if the Senate chooses to confirm him, which I certainly hope it will.;D
"That would be Suresh Kumar, nominee to be Director of U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service; Philip Coyle, nominee to be Associate Director at the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and Mr. Scott Quehl, nominated to be Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Commerce.";N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of you for being willing to make the sacrifices to serve.;D
With respect to dual-use technologies, which is going to be a major part of your portfolio, that obviously can be used in military as well as commercial products and for purposes.;N
How can we promote American innovation without jeopardizing national security, when we are working with countries where there may be a security threat in the future?;N
We will look forward to hearing more as you are in the job about the measures that you are taking.;N
Well, that is so important, and I appreciate what you said because exporting does create jobs in America, and that is what we all want right now, of course.;N
I know that there are other things that you could be doing and have done where you could make a lot more money, and I appreciate your sacrifice, especially Mr. Quehl with a young family.;D
We have about $53 billion worth of trade a year, and we are very interested in Florida in getting these free trade agreements pursued by this Congress and the Administration, hopefully, pursuing them.;N
So I want to speak to you specifically about what role you will play, and will you be an advocate for the consideration of the Colombia, the Panama, and the Korea free trade agreements?;N
Your Commercial Service does a great job, and I have encountered them overseas in the embassies and how they are bringing in businesses.;D
But one thing that we have learned, Mr. Chairman, from previous hearings that we have had, is that not enough of our small business people know about the good work that you do in connecting them with foreign businesses.;N
So anything that you can do to be an educational conduit to small businesses--we have 1.9 million small businesses in Florida--we would really appreciate that.;N
I, too, want to thank our nominees for their public service in the past and willingness to do it in the future and the contributions that your families make, too.;N
I know that any time you enter into the realm of public service, it is a family commitment.;D
Harking back, I have got BRAC tattooed on my brain, like Senator Hutchison perhaps does, too, and I want to compliment you on the good judgment you exercised during the BRAC process, by the way.;N
I do want to piggyback on Senator LeMieux's question, though, and get a little more into this issue.;N
Maybe we would have a difference of opinion, but you have said, and I guess this is from testimony earlier this year in front of the House Armed Services Committee that--or that you wrote that, ``it is clear that the ground-based missile defense system and the U.S. missile defense system proposed for Europe require challenging and realistic testing before Congress and the Administration can determine if those systems can be operationally effective.'';N
Now what Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Staff, has said that--and this was in testimony before the Armed Services Committee--that ``I believe United States has a viable initial operational capability, that we are maturing the system toward a full operational capability.'';N
And then earlier this year, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Keating, who is the PACOM combatant commander, testified that he believed the United States had a high probability of intercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile aimed at the United States by North Korea.;N
And I guess the question I have is how do you reconcile sort of your view, assessment of the operational effectiveness of the ground-based missile defense system with the statements that are being made by some of our military leadership combatant commanders?;N
And in that testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, and this was earlier again this year, you wrote of the need to increase testing, which you just mentioned, for ballistic missile defense systems, including the ground-based mid-course defense system.;N
And yet the Missile Defense Agency Director, General O'Reilly, testified this year before Congress that the Missile Defense Agency was moving away from conducting two ground-based missile defense tests per year to one test every 9 months.;N
What is your view of this new, slower rate of testing, and do you assess that the Missile Defense Agency has the ability to conduct at least two ground-based missile defense flight tests per year?;N
We agreed, I should say, to a negotiating agenda at the U.N. conference on disarmament that commits the U.S. to a treaty on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.;N
I think we need to understand the scope of the impact that that kind of a treaty could have on our defense and U.S. defense programs.;N
And I would ask you--and you don't have to do this now, but if you could furnish this--to identify for the Committee those U.S. defense systems that currently are in the field or in development that might directly or indirectly be used to support an anti-satellite capability.;N
I know when there is a good show people linger on, but now we have substantially reduced the size of the crowd.;N
And this is a position that this will be considered in the final analysis the coup d'etat.;N
So, seriously, it is because Senator Rockefeller has had a problem with his leg, and so the chair is nice.;N
Anyway, on the serious side, I couldn't stay for the other panel, but I particularly was focused on this panel because it has so much relevance to the subject that sits right in front of us.;N
Particularly coming from our Northeast corner with the crowding and the desperate need that we have for getting, finding ways to reduce the traffic congestion and better environmental condition, less dependence on foreign oil and giving people a chance to know that, for the most part, they can arrive at their destinations on time, regardless of weather, and not having to go to an airport where they are competing for space with people going to lots of different places.;N
And we have seen some pretty good development at Amtrak over the years, and we are pleased to have the two of you who are seeking seats on the Amtrak board.;N
And Mr. Rosekind, you come with a lot of experience, and we need the kind of skills that you have developed on the reviews of what is happening on our National Transportation Safety Board to make sure that if accidents do happen, we learn enough to try to prevent them from happening in the future.;D
She is welcome here, and you might see something around here that you would like to have more contact with on a regular and permanent basis.;D
Senator Lautenberg, Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and members of the Committee, I am honored to speak with you today and appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments about the NTSB and to address any questions that you may have.;N
First, I would like to thank President Obama for nominating me to be a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board.;N
Before I begin, please let me introduce some special people that are joining us today--my wife, Dr. Debra Babcock, who is a Pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay area, is joining us.;N
"And viewing in California are my son, Aaron; my daughter, Eve; my mother, Marilyn Rosekind; and my mother-in-law, Lila Babcock.";N
I also would like to thank the other colleagues and friends who have joined us today, especially those from the NTSB, including Chairman Hersman.;N
The primary mission of the NTSB is to enhance transportation safety, which touches everyone's life in some way and provides an invaluable contribution to the American people.;N
Global, around-the-clock transportation demands continue to increase, operations change to meet these demands, and technology rapidly advances.;N
Given these ongoing changes in the transportation system, it is critical that the NTSB continually evolves and enhances its knowledge, capabilities, and expertise.;N
Chairman Hersman has already provided a vision and initiated actions that acknowledge these issues.;N
She has challenged the men and women of the NTSB to ``raise the bar'' and specifically has identified transparency, accountability, and integrity as initial areas for action.;D
It is important to all Americans that the NTSB remains a leading edge resource in its never-ending responsibility to enhance transportation safety.;N
If confirmed, I look forward to collaboration with the NTSB's outstanding professionals to pursue every avenue possible to improve the agency's effectiveness and value.;N
The classic description of the NTSB is that it is the premier accident investigation and recommendation agency in the world.;N
For more than 40 years, this world-class reputation has been built upon the NTSB's hard work to reach meaningful outcomes and consistently exceed its mission objectives.;N
In my interactions with the NTSB over the past 15 years, it is clear that like any great institution, the men and women who comprise the agency's extraordinary staff are the core of its success.;N
Every day, these 400 professionals pursue their work and their passion to enhance transportation safety.;N
They understand the unique role of the NTSB as an independent and nonregulatory agency tasked with enhancing transportation safety through meticulous investigations, fact-based and thoughtful recommendations, and the strategic use of its other available tools.;N
The NTSB's success in achieving its mission is meaningful far beyond its findings and recommendations.;N
Its efforts translate into highly critical and personal terms, the opportunity to prevent injuries and save lives.;N
It is this objective that drives the men and women of the NTSB to pursue and achieve their mission.;N
Recently, the Board's professionals voted it as one of the best places in Government to work.;N
My own passion has been to study human fatigue and apply scientific knowledge to improve performance and safety in diverse settings, including all modes of transportation.;N
Clearly, over the years, the NTSB's findings and my professional endeavors have led us to the same conclusion--that effectively managing fatigue is a critical factor in human performance and transportation safety.;N
If confirmed, I pledge to President Obama, this Senate committee, Congress, the men and women of the NTSB, and, most importantly, the American people that I will contribute all of my energy, knowledge, and expertise to further enhance transportation safety.;N
If permitted to serve as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board, it would be a tremendous professional and personal honor to contribute in any way possible to the vital mission of this invaluable agency.;N
Thank you, every one of you, for your excellent testimony and your wish to make a contribution.;N
Knowing what I do about the Amtrak nominees, I am convinced that you have the desire to make a difference.;N
I assume, Dr. Rosekind, with you, that as you described the value of the agency, that you are all committed to making a welcome contribution to how we function.;N
speed rail in France and Japan and Spain, the GAO found that these countries committed significant Government support for their high-speed rail system.;N
But we are different in this country, and every year, we have got a routine where you have to fight for just enough funds to keep Amtrak afloat.;N
This has been an area of great interest to me because of the deficiencies that exist for not having done it for so many years.;N
I think it is fairly easy to say that there would be a lot of difference in the congestion that we see in the other modes of travel if we had made the investments at a reasonable time and level.;N
I was struck by the fact that Germany at one point committed $70 billion over a 10-year period to build their high-speed system, and they got on with it and did it.;N
Government corporation, we had to beg and borrow, and I am not sure what the total commitment that has been made, but I think that over the years, it hasn't equaled $1 billion a year.;N
Now I don't want you to be put in a position at your introduction to the Senate that you are going to be asking for more money, but apart from your specific suggestion, your specific role in finding how we get these systems up and running that come close to matching those that are some of the most efficient high-speed systems in other countries?;N
The question asked really is kind of tongue-in-cheek because we have seen the things that can be done where the investments are made.;N
And if you look at what we spend on rail and look at what we spend to subsidize aviation, they are good investments.;N
Even with that, we are overwhelmed by the traffic needs in aviation, on highways, and rail is the most laggard of them all.;N
That is, since 1971, we have spent $33 billion on Amtrak, which is less, far less than a billion a year.;N
And we have got to be realistic about, unfortunately, how we are always competing for other needs in the country.;N
Foreign-owned manufacturers of passenger cars and high-speed rail equipment are very interested in competing for this new funding.;N
The revenues derived could be enormous and the opportunity for us to build and learn what to do to satisfy the interests that lie around the country for corridors that could so effectively use the equivalent of the Northeast Corridor, whether it is places out of Chicago that connect with St. Louis and Detroit or other cities around those, around Texas.;N
If you go out West, you know that California has been getting going on some high-speed corridors there.;N
I hope that we are going to demonstrate our seriousness by moving the projects that we have underway that relate directly not just to the Northeast Corridor, but any of the corridors that we might be able to encourage development.;N
Now I know that you have experience in the understanding of fatigue and what erratic sleep does.;D
I almost invited you to come over to my house, but the fact is that it is a serious problem.;N
Should they be mandated on all commercial vehicles, motor vehicles, do you think, to keep fatigued drivers, tired drivers off the road?;N
Earlier this year, Dr. Rosekind, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in Buffalo and resulted in 50 fatalities.;N
The captain and first officer of the aircraft both commuted long distances from their homes to their operating base in Newark, sleeping very little before their scheduled shift.;N
Now has the airline industry done enough to ensure that commercial air pilots are well rested, not flying under fatigue conditions?;N
Yes, we also know that trainees are often--and this is not something that you can help with directly, except in your research when the occasion, unfortunately, requires it.;N
And there are very modest salaries in the early years, and as a consequence, their people are forced to take a second job.;N
Second job, and travelling long distances is a recipe for problems, and we don't want to see that happen.;N
I will conclude with one question more, Senator Hutchison, and that is to Mr. Coscia and Mr. DiClemente, about passenger rail being more energy efficient, and having fewer emissions than driving or flying.;N
But passenger rail still lags behind other modes in passenger miles, and Amtrak is operating at half its capacity.;N
Maybe this would be redundant because we have already discussed how can Amtrak increase its ridership?;N
Have you had a chance to think about that and get people attracted to going by train and out of their cars, and I say this hesitatingly, but out of the planes.;N
Because one of the things that will relieve congestion in the sky is making room for passengers who will take the train and thereby permit us to operate more efficiently with air schedules.;N
I have been a strong supporter of Amtrak, and it is a partnership that is based on the national concept.;N
And I want to ask the two nominees for Amtrak if you are committed to keeping the national system besides the Northeast Corridor, which is the system that has gotten the most of the resources, and the track is owned by Amtrak.;N
But the rest of the country I think also must keep this infrastructure if we are going to have a truly national system, which I think is important for us.;N
And I think now that more states are looking at options for rail, that it would provide us the opportunity to have rail that comes into and out of the Amtrak stations and providing better ridership and better service.;N
I know Mr. Rosekind's area of expertise is fatigue, and I know that you asked questions about that area.;D
So I won't ask questions of Mr. Rosekind, but appreciate very much your nomination and look forward to working with all of you.;N
I know your interest in this work over these years, and you will continue doing that whatever your capacity is.;N
I welcome everyone to this meeting of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and specifically to the nomination hearing of Dr. Carl Wieman, to be Associate Director for Science of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
So what we'll do is we'll leave the record open for a few days for those Senators who would like to submit questions.;N
The OSTP can have up to four Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed associate directors.;N
If confirmed, Dr. Wieman will be responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and advising on national research priorities and inter-agency programs within OSTP's portfolio.;N
According to OSTP Director Dr. Holdren, the Associate Director for Science will oversee STEM education activities and he will act as an expert adviser to the OSTP Director.;N
The advisers offer timely technical counsel to the President and his senior staff on significant policy matters.;N
Staff members inform good policy through sound science and coordinate among science and technology-related agencies.;N
Finally, the OSTP strives to make sure Americans' financial investments make the best possible contribution to our collective prosperity, public health, national security, and environmental quality.;N
Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me an opportunity to add additional comments to the wonderful introduction you just made of Dr. Wieman.;N
I've known Carl for a number of years through his work as a Professor of Physics and a Presidential Teaching Scholar at the University of Colorado.;N
He is, as you pointed out, the President's nominee to be the Associate Director for Science at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.;N
I'm deeply pleased that President Obama recognizes the talent and creativity that Carl will bring to our discussions on science and in particular STEM education.;N
You mentioned that Dr. Wieman won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for producing a new state of matter called the Bose-Einstein condensate.;D
I once asked him, can you see it, and you should maybe perhaps ask him that during his testimony.;N
I also know in front of the Committee recently you had two Apollo astronauts, including the first human to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, who's an iconic figure to all of us.;N
While no doubt this is a remarkable achievement, I would note that 12 men have walked on the Moon.;N
Interestingly enough, Carl's Nobel Prize-winning work built upon earlier work in laser cooling by the other Nobel Prize winner in President Obama's Administration, Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu.;D
While Dr. Wieman is most famous for winning the Nobel Prize, it is his commitment to teaching science to others that is Carl's most remarkable quality in my eyes.;D
He's currently the Director of the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative and, as you mentioned, still spends part of his time at the University of Colorado leading the science education initiative that he founded.;D
He was a founding Chair of the National Academy of Sciences Board on Science Education and he has won many accolades for his teaching.;D
I want to make sure we don't let this witness leave without asking him some tough questions.;N
Senator Udall, I have a few questions and I'll turn it over to you, and I may clean up unless you want to do a second round.;N
But let me ask a question, and it may be the same question or it may be two different questions, but just for our background on the Subcommittee: Would you describe your research on atomic physics and laser spectroscopy and-or--;N
It's very good to have you here today, Dr. Wieman, and we look forward to your work in the executive branch, especially in the teaching area.;D
As a researcher, you relied on the NIST facility in Boulder, Colorado, to help achieve a scientific breakthrough that led to your joint Nobel Prize.;D
NIST and our national laboratories contribute much to science and apply some of the brightest minds in the country to some of the most significant challenges facing our Nation, from fighting terrorism to achieving energy independence.;N
The national labs I think are really crown jewels in our country's research infrastructure.;N
As Associate Director for Science, how would you employ the diverse knowledge and work of the national labs in your efforts to improve our Nation's competitiveness and maintain our leadership in scientific research?;N
We have two of the great national laboratories in New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory, that do a lot of the work that I talked about in terms of energy independence, helping the warrior out in the field, and a variety of other things.;N
Let me ask you a little bit about education because I know that's what you really want to focus on.;N
You note in your testimony that you attended a tiny rural school in western Oregon and relied on a public library in a nearby town to supplement your education.;D
My home State of New Mexico also faces significant challenges when it comes to rural schools and especially schools on tribal lands.;N
Do you have any thoughts on what efforts have been successful to overcome these challenges to teaching science in rural schools?;N
Do you have any recommendations for how better broadband connectivity or access to other technologies might put students in rural schools on a more even footing with their peers in metropolitan areas?;N
And also, I talked to you before the hearing about how you've developed techniques and protocols, I think, to teach science to children, and I'm interested in what are those protocols and how do you approach it, and especially dealing with disadvantaged students.;D
According to this year's Science and Engineering Indicators Report of the National Science Board, although America continues to lead in science and engineering, Asian countries are closing the gap through significantly increased investments in science and engineering, business investment, and education and infrastructure.;N
How will you apply your knowledge in an attempt to redirect America's course and get us going in the right direction again?;N
What provisions of America Competes have proven to be the most successful and which programs do you think should be strengthened?;N
Well, as we go through a reauthorization, those are the kind of questions we'll be asking, basically how is it working, are there things that we need to improve or delete or change, that kind of exercise.;N
STEM is a program that I think has been great in a lot of ways, and NASA has been kind of a lead agency.;N
They're places where science, engineering, and what-not come together and try to be innovative and get things out to the marketplace, etcetera.;N
I've seen first-hand in my state a science park really does some great things at the University of Arkansas.;N
But let me ask you from your perspective, to what extent do you believe that science parks can contribute to scientific discovery and to technological advances?;N
I think part of the key there is recognizing your strengths and having some flexibility and the appropriate expectations.;N
"I know one of the advantages of the one that's in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at least what I hear about it, is that because the University of Arkansas is a relatively small university--it's not a huge university; it only has about maybe 16 or 17,000 students--because it is smaller, that's actually a strength because the faculty and the researchers tend to know each other, they work in closer proximity, and they say that they're better there in sharing ideas and collaborating together than some of the older, more established institutions, if that makes sense, where you kind of get your area of expertise and you're kind of so big that's all you do.";N
The other thing that they really focus on in Arkansas is trying to bring these ideas actually to the marketplace.;N
So like for example, in nanotechnology, their effort there, they don't just call it nanotechnology.;N
They like to call it ``nano manufacturing,'' because they really want to try to get these ideas out of the lab and get them out in the marketplace.;N
So I know not everybody has the same mission, nor should they, because there's going to be different strengths and different roles as we do this.;N
But I agree, I think that they can play a very significant role in trying to stimulate more scientific activity, research activity, innovation, technology.;N
What we're going to do, Dr. Wieman, is we're going to leave the record open until 6 p.m. tomorrow, for all the Senators and staffs who want to ask you more questions, like they want to get you to explain this Bose-Einstein thing one more time or something like that.;N
So what we'd ask all the staffs to do and all the offices to do is to get those as quickly as possible over here to the Committee, and then we'll get those to you, and a rapid response would be very much appreciated.;N
But I want to thank you for your willingness to take on this public service and really do some great things there and play a key role in developing this policy and giving advice to the folks who need it.;D
So I want to thank you for being here today and thank you for all the folks you brought with you.;N
Dr. Scott Doney is being considered for the Office of Chief Scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.;N
The Maritime Commission isn't known by everybody, but it really does important work and hopefully you're going to be there, or continue to be there.;N
NOAA's Administrator, Dr. Jane Lubchenco, has dedicated herself to advancing research, science, innovation and technology at NOAA.;D
Dr. Doney's nomination as chief scientist is an important step in maintaining NOAA's status as a top science agency, which is very important in any government, in any Executive Branch, but particularly in this one, where there's a lot of pride in the science aspect of what they do.;N
We'll consider two nominations today to the Federal Maritime Commission, a little known, but very important independent regulatory agency.;N
I am pleased that two very qualified, in my judgment, individuals have been selected to serve on it.;D
Mr. Cordero and Ms. Dye will have the balance and the wisdom to do something which nobody has ever figured out how to do, which is to figure out: What is a proper balance between the needs of the shippers and the needs of consumers and businesses importing and exporting products?;D
You've also served the Maritime Administration, in the Department of Transportation, and worked in the House of Representatives.;D
I look forward to hearing the results of Mrs. Dye's recent investigation into vessel capacity shortages.;D
I commend her for leading such a comprehensive effort and for her service at the Federal Maritime Commission.;D
And so, ending up my long speech, I thank the nominees for testifying today, and I urge a speedy confirmation for them.;N
Just let it be said, in an era of apparent conflict and malfunction in the Congress, here are two people who do not have conflict and malfunction.;N
I want to hear from her, and I also want to hear from our Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Frank Lautenberg.;N
These are very important positions: the Maritime Commissioners and the NOAA Chief Scientist.;N
And, of course, being from a Gulf State, I know that NOAA and weather prediction are very important.;N
And I will tell you that the technology of the last 10 to 15 years has been immensely helpful in the predictions of when a hurricane is going to hit, how forceful it's going to be, and what the route is.;N
And I know that our most recent terrible hurricane, Ike, which hit in 2008, NOAA's advanced hurricane warnings did definitely minimize the loss of life.;N
And I will say the property damage was huge, but we were able to open our ports to commerce quickly because we did know what was going to happen, from the predictions.;N
This committee has the important responsibility of overseeing both the Federal Maritime Commission and NOAA.;N
And I want to thank these nominees for agreeing to provide their services to the American people.;N
With international commerce growing as it has, the Federal Maritime Commission makes sure that our Nation's ports remain competitive and can meet the demand--the growing demand placed on them.;N
This is especially vital in my State, New Jersey, which is the home of Port Newark, the largest port on the East Coast, generating $20 billion a year in economic activity.;N
The Port of Newark is the lifeblood of, not just our region's economy, but also our Nation's economy.;N
In 2001, when the Port of Long Beach, in California, was shut down because of a labor dispute, it cost the economy $1 billion a day.;N
And it just seems, with the ferocity of hurricanes and tornados, and most certainly with the things that are done in one area, we don't even really have good records about how it affects another area.;N
For instance, cloud seeding in Midwest, and how does it affect Colorado, or how does it affect another area downstream?;N
And, my question to you is: Do you think that it would be worth getting more data collected, when there are weather modification programs in different areas, to see how it affects that area and then also other areas?;N
And, second, the possibility of studying modifying a hurricane when it is 20 miles out, rather than having it hit and have such a devastating impact on people and property.;N
Do you think it would be worthwhile for NOAA to do the beginning planning and what would be the first step?;N
"Because I think you're absolutely right, you don't want to do any weather modification; you want to study what the effects might be before you would actually do something.";N
Just to start looking at what the options are, maybe talk to other scientists that might have looked at this, as well.;N
It just seems like, with all that's happening, we ought to be proactive in studying it and keeping data, at a very minimum.;N
And then, from that, perhaps seeing if there is a course that should be taken, because you don't, I agree, want to do something until you know what the effect would be at the end.;N
I think you covered the maritime issues very well, so I'm not going to have other questions there.;N
This is actually to both institutions--the Maritime Commission can know what deficiencies exist in ports and how they need to be included, or whatever other infrastructure is needed along the way.;N
You're putting out a report, coming out today, and that's going to have a lot of information in it.;N
We do consider numerous nominees, but it's not too often that we welcome one of our own before us.;N
We did so when Debbie Hersman was nominated to the Chair of the NTSB and when David Strickland was nominated to be the NHTSA Administrator.;N
Now we have Ann Begeman, who is nominated to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.;N
As everyone knows well, she has been an important member of the Commerce Committee staff for over a decade, and we welcome her nomination.;D
She helped craft the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act, which would address long-time concerns by shippers about predatory pricing and practices, increase competition, and establish a level playing field.;D
And the reason I wanted to speak, Mr. Chairman, was I wanted to emphasize, since I won't be here for her questioning--I'll be at the Judiciary Committee--how important that bill is and the work that must continue for our captive shippers.;N
Whenever I say that word at home, my 15-year-old daughter asks me if I'm talking about pirates.;N
But I want to make clear that we still have a number of businesses in my state and farmers who are very concerned about what's happening.;N
When I first came to the Senate, they would tell me that the STB would simply not listen to their concerns.;N
Well, under new leadership, the STB is now listening to our shippers, examining anti-competitive issues, and considering next steps to ensure that America's freight rail customers receive fair rates and good service.;N
Given Ms. Begeman's experience, once confirmed, I know she'll be ready to consider these very important issues.;D
I also would like to mention Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, who's nominated to be the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Observation and Prediction of NOAA at the U.S. Department of Commerce.;N
NOAA's North Central River Forecast Center is vital to helping communities along the Red River in Minnesota and North Dakota and other rivers in the upper Midwest prepare for flooding, with reports of water levels and rates of flow.;N
We're very concerned about all of the snow we've had and what may happen in the next months with the Red River, and having these flood predictions is incredibly important for us.;N
I'll proceed now to my opening statement, followed by Senator Hutchison, and I think Senator Thune wants to make some remarks.;N
We start with the nomination of Ms. Begeman to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.;N
Beloved by all, respected by all, she's a virtual institution on this committee, and in the Senate.;D
She's also a consummate professional, ever ready to come together to find solutions to complex issues, and an expert on surface transportation issues.;D
I know Ms. Begeman will be able to dive right into the complicated issues that come before the STB.;D
These are very important issues, both for the captive shippers and for the entire rail industry.;N
But on the other hand, I'm pleased that she's headed into a new position where the nation can benefit from her tremendous talent.;D
He's an expert on national security policy, military research and development of military space systems.;D
The fact that this committee is again considering Mr. Coyle's nomination to be Associate Director for National Security and International Affairs at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, is a testament to the need for such an expert in this post.;D
When there wasn't floor time for discussion on the matter, that became impossible, and then we couldn't move him by unanimous consent, so President Obama recess-appointed him.;N
For the past 8 months Mr. Coyle has served as an advisor to the administration on issues of critical national security importance, such as cybersecurity, emergency communications, and international science diplomacy.;D
But I am very pleased to be able to introduce her as the nominee for membership on the Surface Transportation Board.;N
I think that the previous two statements from the majority side of the aisle show that Ann Begeman is effective.;D
She is in the category of nominee that no introduction to this committee is required because we have worked with her for so long.;D
She previously served the Committee as Deputy Staff Director and Professional Staff Member on surface transportation issues for many years.;D
Between her tours of service on the Committee, she also served as Legislative Director and Acting Chief of Staff for Senator John McCain.;D
She has a well-earned reputation as an expert in transportation issues and is one of the go-to people in the Senate for anything related to surface transportation.;D
I have relied on Ann's advice and counsel for nearly 18 years since my earliest days in the Senate as a member of this committee.;D
The recently passed FAA Reauthorization Bill stands as a perfect example of Ann's steadfastness and perseverance.;N
In the last year alone, this committee has had victories large and small, ranging from the America COMPETES Act, the NASA Reauthorization Act, to the first movement in many years on Surface Transportation Board reauthorization.;N
I think that speaks well of both of our staffs, Mr. Chairman, and how well they have worked together to move our committee, really, into the forefront of committees that have been active and effective, and sent bills to the floor that passed the Senate.;N
In each of these areas and countless others, Ann has been a strong leader and a creative force for the public's interest.;D
We don't often pause to recognize that type of humble service, but the country has been the fortunate beneficiary of people like Ann Begeman.;D
If you ask anyone who has worked with Ann Begeman how best to describe her, they will inevitably say that she is focused on detail and is an excellent manager.;D
But I know that her knowledge, her experience, and her unwavering attention to detail will soon be focused on complex surface transportation issues as a Member of the STB.;D
I have no doubt that Ann will make an immediate impact on the crucial rail issues facing our Nation.;D
I also want to welcome Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, who has been nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary.;N
It provides services such as hurricane forecasting that are essential to the protection of life and property.;N
When Hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast in 2008, I saw first-hand NOAA's advanced warning system work.;N
They pinpointed where it was going and when it was going to hit, and allowed the protection of so much of the property that was involved in that hurricane.;N
And I am pleased to join this morning's nomination hearing and want to welcome all of the nominees to the Committee.;N
And at the risk of echoing what my colleagues have said--we're not ignoring the other members that are here for nomination today.;N
But I am here particularly, too, because Ann Begeman is appearing before this committee to serve as one of the three members of the Surface Transportation Board.;N
Many of us have had the opportunity not just to work with Ann over the years as a Professional Staff Member on this committee and her years of work, on behalf of various colleagues.;D
town South Dakota girl who has brought her South Dakota work ethic and professionalism to Washington, D.C., and to the work of the U.S. Senate.;D
Ann has, as has already been mentioned by you, Mr. Chairman, by Senator Hutchison, an extraordinary record of accomplishment over a long period of time.;D
She is someone who I think has proven and demonstrated the ability to immerse herself into the technical details of the complex legislation that we deal with in front of this committee but, at the same time, still able to see the public policy implications of what we do from the 30,000 foot level.;D
And that's a unique combination of skills, in the realm in which we deal on a daily basis.;D
And I can't think of anybody that is more qualified or would be better equipped to serve as a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.;D
And I say that as a former State Rail Director in South Dakota and someone who has worked not only on this committee, but in the in House of Representatives on the relevant committees that have jurisdiction over the nation's rail carriers.;D
Ann is incredibly capable and talented and, when it comes to the rate and service issues that are going to come before the Surface Transportation Board, is going to be extremely well-equipped to deal with those issues.;D
And I have a high level of confidence that the Surface Transportation Board is going to be extraordinarily well-served by her presence there.;D
I will miss, I have to say, looking behind me to get answers to questions, as we often do look to her for her expertise.;D
But I know she is looking forward to the service that she will provide the country at the STB, as are we.;D
And so, I am delighted to be able to be here today to support a fellow South Dakotan and someone who comes from a small town called Humboldt, South Dakota, and has been a very humble public servant in her time here in Washington.;D
And I hope that we can speed these nominations, as Senator Hutchison said, along through the Committee process and get them to the floor so we can get folks into the positions where they can begin making a difference for us.;N
And you had a little chance to relax a little bit and think over your testimony, and we look forward to hearing it.;N
But, as you know, I'm here, Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison, and Senator Thune, to talk about an Ohioan.;N
From the Wright Brothers Bicycle Shop in Dayton, Ohio, to John Glenn's first orbit, your former colleague, Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon, Ohio has been at the forefront and has had a rich history in flight and a tradition in flight, science and aerospace.;N
After the oil spill incident of recent times, there were about, I think maybe 15 dead dolphins that washed up on the shores of the Gulf.;N
And so, that sort of symbolizes a question which I think is almost impossible to ask, because I want to see how well you do in answering it.;N
I'm not sure that your position calls for you to be balanced, and some of us discussed that honestly.;N
There's always, well--we can balance the needs of the natural order on Earth and the needs of our country economically, et cetera.;N
I'm going to focus on Mr. Coyle and Dr. Sullivan, because I know Ann so well, and I think you have been very forthcoming.;D
Mr. Coyle, if I could just interrupt you, your view of our missile defense system, however, is going to make a difference, because you do have a purview of national security--it is a different area, but your comments in the past have raised questions about your view of missile defense, which I think is going to be important in the decision about your posture in national defense issues.;D
So, may I ask you, do you support, then, the deployment of a missile defense system if you consider that it is scientifically ready?;N
You are saying you support missile defense because of the threats that we have, and that even if we didn't have the threats that we have, you would still encourage having the research and technology to have a deployable missile defense system--I'm putting words in your mouth but----;D
Do you think that we should be doing more, and it is worth pursuing more of an effort, to get the data collection on what does happen now and its effects on other areas, to begin to look at whether it is the right thing to do, to try to modify, say, hurricane intensity?;N
But, to find out better what the effects might be, should we be focusing more on either data collection or research?;N
And I understand perhaps that you don't have the capability, or the information, rather, from the agency.;N
I guess my last question would be, would you work with me and my staff to determine what areas we might pursue to upgrade our information in a positive way?;N
Let me just say that you cannot find in this Senate anybody who's more opposed to a missile defense system than I am.;N
But that makes absolutely no difference to me with respect to your position, because OSTP has absolutely nothing to do with missile defense.;N
But you are going to get my vote, because OSTP does not work on this, and you work for OSTP.;N
What you work on are the responsibilities of the Department of Defense and the National Security Council and others, but OSTP champions science and technology.;N
So, is it not fair to say that you have absolutely no responsibility for operations, acquisitions or deployments of things such as the missile defense system?;N
Senator Feinstein, I realize that you and Senator Boxer want to introduce, but there may be others who want to give opening statements.;N
So we have two distinguished people this afternoon before us, and the first is John Bryson of California.;N
Much of the conversation today is going to focus on Mr. Bryson, who has a varied and very impressive resume, and a background running an extremely large utility company in California for a very long time.;D
But on the other hand, some have raised concerns about Mr. Bryson's experience as a founding member of an environmental organization that has, at times, used very aggressive tactics, including suing Mr. Bryson and his company, and then also having policies that don't necessarily comport with some views held by others on the Committee.;D
Others have raised concerns about his support for a 2009 proposal to cap emissions, which was a position widely held in the utility industry.;N
That said, I need to tell you that I had a very productive and positive meeting with Mr. Bryson last week when he visited my office, and I have great respect for his desire to serve our country.;D
But along with that, I have enormous faith in his creative ability through his executive experience to find ways to stimulate manufacturing--which this Committee is dedicating itself to for the rest of the year and next--and that he has the kind of ability to create jobs in America.;D
The nominations of Mr. Bryson and Mr. Garcia come at an incredible crossroads for the country and for the Commerce Department.;D
High unemployment, a slow recovery, the Commerce Secretary and Deputy Secretary play an enormous role in supporting jobs and our economy.;N
Manufacturing has been hit hard over the last decade--losing, as everybody knows, nearly one-third of its workforce--and the Government's response has been piecemeal to tepid.;N
If in the next decade, things are as bad for manufacturing jobs as the previous decade, we will have little left in that sector to save.;N
This, in turn, has grave national security implications and could cripple our ability to out-innovate and out-compete other countries.;N
Next week, I'm holding a full Committee field hearing in West Virginia on exporting products made in America.;N
I'm also going to introduce a slew of bills in the next number of days, which are on point, I believe.;N
For the foreseeable future, I intend to use this Committee to find ways to make manufacturing a spark in our job-creating agenda.;N
For example, almost two-thirds of our department's budget is dedicated to NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.;N
And I want to hear about Mr. Bryson's views and Mr. Garcia's views on the Administration's reorganization proposal.;N
They are not necessarily leaving NOAA alone, I think to a great disadvantage of our country.;N
NOAA's weather satellites, I want to talk about that, and the Department's cybersecurity efforts.;N
Mr. Chairman, we have before us today the two most senior positions with the Department of Commerce, which is tasked with promoting business, creating jobs, and spurring economic growth.;N
While this has always been important, it is most essential now, with an unemployment rate at 9.1 percent.;N
The Administration has talked a great deal about job creation and the need for regulatory reform.;N
Since taking office, President Obama has grown the size of the federal regulatory workforce by more than 16 percent, by some estimates.;N
There are now more than 275,000 federal employees whose entire focus is adding to the ever-expanding regulatory burden of America's job creators.;N
So while there has been talk about streamlining regulation, we see the Federal Register come on schedule every day with even more proposed rules for innovators and job creators to negotiate.;N
You know what, I don't have--oh, yes, I do have arrivals, which happens to be a Senator Lautenberg.;N
And we have a distinguished colleague at the desk, and I don't want to take too much time.;N
But I've got to say, we are so lucky to have someone with the qualifications that John Bryson and Terry Garcia bring to these positions.;N
In addition to being very proud fathers, we're both former CEOs while we care about the environment and the well-;N
So in order to try and meet the short time deadline, I introduce a letter from the Business Roundtable that was sent June 21.;N
And they write, John Engler, who's the President, I believe, of the organization--anyway, he says here that John Bryson's extensive experience in the private sector has well-;D
equipped him to take on the many issues the department must address to support the U.S. economy and job creation, issues like technology, innovation, intellectual property, and trade.;N
And they remind us that the Business Roundtable is an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies with nearly $6 trillion in annual revenues and more than 13 million employees.;N
It's hard to find something better than that, and also the fact that he's cared about the environment is deserving of credibility and support.;N
So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for doing this, and as I look at Mr. Bryson's background--18 years chairman and CEO of Edison International, delivers power to nearly 14 million Californians, holds the distinction of being our country's top buyer of renewable energy.;D
Friends, we're lucky to get someone like this who wants to sit in here and do the job that they have to do, sacrifice lots of things in the outside world.;D
And we ought to just move on this thing and stop the obstructionism that so often invades a review of a person's qualifications, without looking at the qualification.;N
With the permission of the Committee, I'm going to ask that Senator Feinstein be able to go ahead and introduce John Bryson, and then we will return to our----;N
And I see members of the Intelligence Committee here, so I know they're not playing hooky, but it's good to be here.;N
I have the distinct pleasure today to introduce to the Committee John Bryson, a former chairman, CEO, and president of Edison International, and most importantly to Senator Boxer and myself, a Californian.;D
On May 31, John was nominated by President Obama to serve as the 37th Secretary of Commerce.;D
I believe that he is enormously well-suited for this important role, particularly at a time when our economy remains fragile and job creation isn't occurring fast enough.;D
John's experience running a multibillion dollar company, a very large utility, his success as a strong advocate for business, and his readiness to advance a jobs agenda make him a strong and positive fit for Commerce Secretary.;D
That's the parent company of Southern California Edison, which provides power to 14 million Californians and nearly 300,000 businesses.;N
As the Committee will recall, in 2000 and 2001, California was gripped by an energy crisis that resulted in rolling blackouts that left millions of Californians in the dark.;N
I watched closely as he successfully fended off financial disaster, even as other California utilities were not so fortunate.;D
I met and spoke with John Bryson often during that energy crisis and remember well his intelligence and pragmatism as utilities, state officials, and Washington worked their way through the crisis.;D
In my observation, he worked hard for the people of California, his shareholders, and the many businesses that relied on a stable power grid.;D
I believe John will carry the same thoughtful, sensible leadership style with him to the Commerce Department.;D
And during his years at Edison International, John's leadership of this very large utility was strong and effective.;D
Well, Edison International, headquartered in Southern California, at this time owned a portfolio that was 40 percent coal.;N
As a result of this also, he had diversified the investment portfolio of that great utility.;D
But nonetheless, I respected it, because he had such a heavy presence at the time, not in California, but in other states, in coal.;D
Simply put, he understands what businesses need to succeed, and I think will bring that approach to the department, if confirmed.;D
In addition, he has served as a director, chairman, or adviser for a wide array of companies, schools, and nonprofits, including many institutions with deep roots in California, such as a director of the Walt Disney Company, BrightSource Energy, Boeing, and assets manager KKR, the California Business Roundtable, the Public Policy Institute of California, and USC's Keck School of Medicine.;D
It includes the Council for Foreign Relations, Stanford University, California Institute of Technology, and the California Endowment.;N
I'm also proud to note that he and I share the same alma mater, Stanford, were John earned his undergraduate degree.;D
John's experience paints a picture of a leader who focuses on the practical and the achievable.;D
At this time in our troubled economic history, our number one priority as a government must be to grow this economy.;N
In my view, John's combination of pragmatism, experience in the boardroom, and understanding of the public sector will make him an outstanding Secretary of Commerce.;D
I expect he will be a powerful voice inside the Administration and a partner with the business community to grow our economy and open international markets for American manufacturers.;D
And I very much thank you for the courtesy, Senator Rockefeller, and also for that of your committee.;N
I often say at home, I'm chairman of a committee, and Senator Feinstein is, but the difference is, I can talk about my work and she really can't say that much about hers, because the Intelligence Committee is kind of secretive, so we wish you well.;D
And I want to say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I think that our country is really better served when the people pay attention to the work we do.;N
I hope they pay attention to this nomination and the way this particular nominee is treated.;N
I could speak personally that Senator Lautenberg is right when he says, thank you, John, for accepting this challenge.;N
You bring a wealth of experience in both the private sector and the public sector to this very important job.;D
What I'm going to do is, Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, is to ask you to put my statement in the record.;N
And I would like to conclude with a quote from the Los Angeles Times, June 21, a wonderful editorial, and I'll close with that within my time.;N
The headline says, ``Commerce Department nominee deserves the job,'' and the subhead is, ``Within a rational political universe, John Bryson's credentials would bring him confirmation by acclamation.'';D
And here's what they say, in part, ``A long-time chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison and Edison International, he is a pillar of the region's business community, admired by the Chamber of Commerce and his fellow executives.;D
He also was a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, where his work earned him respect and appreciation from California's environmental movement.;D
He's been president of the California Public Utilities Commission and he even served as a director of Boeing, dipping his toe into the nation's military-industrial complex.;D
And that's why I say--my editorial--I hope everybody follows this in politics, whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent, because John is the rare nominee to present himself to Congress with endorsements from the Chamber, military suppliers, and the nation's leading environmental organizations.;D
If ever there was a time for someone who can bring us all together, this is that moment in history.;N
Tom Donohue of the Chamber said, Mr. Bryson's ``extensive knowledge of the private sector and years of experience successfully running a major company'' makes him qualified.;D
The Business Roundtable called Mr. Bryson, quote, ``A proven, well-respected executive who will bring his private sector experience to the Commerce Department's broad portfolio that includes technology, trade, intellectual property, and exports, which will be crucial to expanding the economy and creating jobs.'';D
I noted in your opening statement, John, that you talked about your work with colleagues in founding the NRDC, and it was before Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and the rivers were on fire at that time.;D
And I want to thank you for that, because I find myself quoting Richard Nixon quite a lot on the floor of the U.S. Senate these days, as there are moves to repeal this or that part of our landmark laws.;N
And I'm just thrilled with the nomination, and I thank you for the honor of being able to speak today.;N
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that a full opening text be placed in the record as if read in full.;N
And I ask that a letter to you, Mr. Chairman, from Congressman Tierney and Congressman Frank, regarding Massachusetts fisheries, be made part of the record.;N
We share a mutual friend, David Radcliffe, who told me yesterday at breakfast to tell you hello again, so I want to be sure and send that along.;N
And I hear the admonition loud and clear, but I'm tempted to make one other admonition to all of us.;N
And this gentleman was on the Board of Directors of the Boeing Company, which right now is in the middle of a major controversy brought about by the NLRB when it's about to open a plant that's going to hire 1,000 Americans.;D
So I think it's fair to ask civility on both sides of the issue of jobs, civility on the part of the regulators to not continually be on the backs of employers at a time we don't need it, and civility on our part to expedite the movement of America to more trade, more commerce, and more prosperity.;N
And I'd like to echo Senator Toomey's comments about trade and look forward to hearing Mr. Bryson's observations about what we do to trade.;D
I had a chance to see the U.S. Trade Representative, Ron Kirk the other night, and I'm hopeful, as he is, that we'll see the current trade agreements come to the Congress, and we'll see an active effort to be sure that we open trade opportunities to Americans.;N
I think that we're going to lose a real opportunity in this country if we don't pursue a competitive agenda for America.;N
Some of it is under your agency, but some of it simply should come with the need to have someone that brings agencies together and focuses on moving our country forward competitively.;N
And the things we talked about, workforce readiness so that we have people actually getting degrees and getting trained in jobs where we need them.;N
Obviously, that's working with the Department of Education, but when they can't find a welder in southern Minnesota to work at agriculture equipment places that are trying to find highly paid employees, we've got a problem.;N
Small and medium-sized businesses with exports, helping them to have the kind of resources that they need, which can be very small investment for the big gain they get.;N
Working with the State Department so that our large businesses are better able to get contracts and get assistance from our agencies and other countries, in order to follow through on the President's pledge to double exports.;N
The rules and regulations, which some of my colleagues have referenced--we no longer are competing in a vacuum in this country.;N
Our businesses are competing against companies in other countries that have different rules and regulations.;N
And then one specific area that the Commerce Department has direct jurisdiction over, where I think it's not just the low-;N
We talked about the fact that we have lost 16 percent of the international tourism business in this country.;N
It's not about the economy, as the leading Republican on our committee, Senator Blunt, knows.;N
India takes 93 days average to get a visa from Shanghai to come to America, and it takes only 10 days to go to Great Britain.;N
Every one of these foreign tourists spends an average of $5,000 when they come to this country.;N
So if we want to meet the President's goal and do something about jobs in this country, I'd start right on day one saying let's work to change this visa policy, not to change the security, just to get the consulate officers out there that generate $1 million in fees a person.;N
It's just about trying as hard as we can to make this country competitive with what we have.;N
And I know it's a lot that I've laid out here, but I truly believe that's where we need to go as a country with the Commerce Secretary.;N
Look, I don't want to make a big deal about this, but I have Senator Snowe and then Senator DeMint.;N
I appreciate your willingness to serve, and I really have no question about your credentials.;D
My question is about the environment you'll be working in, and whether or not you'll have the courage to speak up against some of the most anti- business policies I think we've ever seen in our country.;N
As Senator Isakson already mentioned, the National Labor Relations Board, the Acting General Counsel, who has been appointed by Obama to be the General Counsel, has accused you as well as Bill Daley, Chief of Staff for the President, of breaking the law.;N
They're forcing a major American company to spend millions of dollars and put thousands of jobs on hold for what is an unprecedented violation of a company's ability to locate an expansion facility anywhere they want.;N
As Senator Toomey has said, there's a lot of rhetoric about free trade, but when the agreements are supposed to be sent over, they're not sent over, and one excuse after another.;N
Thousands of jobs, probably billions of dollars of investment, are being sidetracked in the telecommunications business, because the FCC is violating Congressional direction and court orders to move ahead and regulate the Internet in a way that makes investors hesitant.;N
With the EPA, it's just amazing, hearing from the companies that come through my office, whether they're in manufacturing or utilities or mining, the absurd regulations and gray areas that are being created.;N
Of course, banks are afraid to make loans, because of the regulators hanging over their shoulders.;N
I would not be Commerce Secretary in an Administration that has taken all these positions.;N
One thing the Constitution says is that the Federal Government should facilitate interstate commerce.;N
Obviously, these are two important positions, and I, too, had the opportunity and the pleasure yesterday to meet with the nominee, Mr. Bryson, as Secretary of Commerce.;N
And of course, I know Mr. Garcia from his days as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, as well as deputy administrator to NOAA.;D
There's no doubt Mr. Bryson has a very extensive background in the corporate arena, as CEO of Edison International.;D
And I do believe that he has an appreciation for the paramount value of job creation in the private sector, and that it's absolutely a prerequisite to our economic well-being, and central to revitalizing the economic conditions of this country.;D
I also want to echo what Senator Kerry said with respect to Mr. Garcia, because I think it's important for the fisheries industry to make sure that we're not imposing burdensome regulations on an industry that is struggling to survive.;N
We have to design regulations that are important to the fishing communities and to the fishermen as well as to rebuilding the species.;N
Mr. Bryson, Mr. Garcia, do you still want this job after-- Let me just say, I really didn't have opening comments, so I'll just be very brief and just say that, one, I'm looking forward to working with both of you, but especially from Alaska's perspective, as we're very proud of our fisheries.;N
They're sustainable, they're growing, they're a huge export opportunity for this country through wise management and cooperation and work with the Commerce Department over the years.;N
Even though we've had our friction at times with NOAA and the Commerce Department, we have created an incredible opportunity in a sense of fisheries, from our perspective in Alaska, which now manages 60 percent of the live catch of this country.;N
And so we think we have examples and expertise that can be shared around the country on how to maximize the fishery opportunities that are not as great in certain parts of the country.;N
Also, Alaska is a net exporter, $4.2 billion in commodities last year, up almost 30 percent.;N
But at the same time, we survive on our own, in a lot of ways, in the sense of our export opportunities.;N
And a lot of the work you do and you will do as dealing with fisheries, tourism, export, international trade, that's a lot of Alaska.;N
It was a decade of neglect by many people throughout Congress and throughout this country.;N
I think that's the stress point that everyone has here, that jobs are the most important piece of the equation.;N
So how you take it to the next level is going to be critical, because we have created jobs.;N
They may not be as robust as we would like, but we're at the great recession, which is the equivalent, if we missed a couple notches in 2009, it would've been the Great Depression.;N
But now we have to take it to the next level, and I think that's what we're looking for and looking toward you to do, as well as others of the President's economic Cabinet, because with your work, it's going to help to determine a long-term future.;N
I just gave you statistics from a state that understands what it's like to not just work within our borders but globally and understands that there is business beyond our borders, and sometimes you have to just bite the bullet and get moving.;N
And I think your business experience is going to be critical, and I think you have a bureaucratic system over there.;D
And NOAA plays a role in making sure that we move forward in oil and gas exploration in the Arctic and what can be done there in the most environmentally sound way, but recognize that it's a critical piece of our commerce in the future.;N
Two, get in there with a very positive attitude, because where we are today and where we were 2 years ago is day and night.;N
But we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and you're going to be part of that equation.;N
And I want to thank you for your public service and your willingness to serve, and I look forward to hearing from the witness.;D
We've got to have that voice to get back the $2.5 trillion just sitting on balance sheets, to give them the confidence to get reinvested in our country.;N
I personally believe the single biggest job creation entity, bigger than anything the Commerce Department or, candidly, anything we will do here, would be putting a long-;N
And for an Administration that has been criticized, not always appropriately, of not having enough people with senior business experience at the top level, my hope is that you will get this job and be that advocate for the private sector, be that advocate for the business community, recognize that we've got to read a balance sheet and get our nation's balance sheet back in order, and get this job engine that has improved kicked into high gear.;N
Mr. Chairman, I will follow in the footsteps of my senior Senator from Arkansas and go ahead and yield back my time, in the interests of getting the rest of the hearing going.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Hutchison, for holding today's hearing to consider these two nominations.;N
It's been nearly a year since Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner published an op-ed in the New York Times entitled, ``Welcome to the Recovery,'' an op-ed that in retrospect seems to have been a flawed prediction, to put it mildly.;N
The economy should be roaring back by now, but instead it's still struggling, and the unemployment rate is 9.1 percent as of June 3.;N
And has already been noted by some of my colleagues, excessive corporate taxes and needless regulations are preventing the creation of jobs and severely limiting economic growth in the country.;N
With all of these problems, it is important--critically important, actually--that we have a Secretary of Commerce who has a strong record of accomplishment in creating jobs in the private sector, someone who knows the challenges and how to overcome the barriers the private sector faces in creating jobs.;N
And there are aspects of Mr. Bryson's record that I think are very impressive in some circles.;N
There are some concerns I have, including his support for the job-killing cap-and-trade proposal.;N
And so, you know, I'm anxious to hear from him about the steps that he thinks we need to be taking to get the country back on track and get the economy back on track.;N
But I will just simply echo what my colleagues have said, Mr. Chairman, and reiterate, the Commerce Secretary has got to be a strong advocate for trade and open markets for America's farmers and manufacturers.;N
And I signed a letter, along with I think most of my Republican colleagues, to Majority Leader Reid back in March, stating that we would withhold support for trade-related nominees, including Commerce Secretary, until the Administration submits the pending free trade agreements to Congress for their consideration.;N
It's been over 3 months since that letter was sent, and the Administration has still not committed to a specific timetable for implementing those agreements.;N
And I believe I speak for a good number of those in our caucus when I say that it's going to be difficult for Republicans to support Mr. Bryson's nomination until the Administration submits those free trade agreements.;N
They are vital, vital to farmers and ranchers in my state, and vital to our economic recovery.;N
And just to put a fine point on that, in 2008, the market share that we had in Colombia of corn, wheat, and soybeans was 81 percent.;N
The vacuum has been filled by other countries who continue to sign bilateral trade agreements with these three countries.;N
And I appreciate both Mr. Bryson and Mr. Garcia being here today and look forward to hearing their testimony and the steps they intend to get the economy back on track.;N
Well, first let me say that I am pleased that the nominee for Commerce Secretary has had business experience, and I think the President needs more people around him with business experience, and you fulfill that role.;D
And I do hope that what you said in your opening statement, which is that you will be a cheerleader and advocate for the regulatory reform that we all agree needs to be done, but which, frankly, has not been done so far, you will fill that role.;N
Now, along the lines of what the Chairman has started, with the coal industry, I have concerns about some of the things you have said regarding energy regulations.;N
And in a speech where you came out for cap-and-trade legislation, you said that it is a tax, and that regulations that penalize energy producers for producing more energy than needed by the government were the best way to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases.;N
So, the question is, having talked to so many business people, and the cost of energy being one of their toughest issues and one of their biggest concerns, are you anti-energy?;N
Are you for taxing energy--raising the cost, and letting that have the effect of hurting our businesses, while gaining the purported result of having more investment in other forms of energy?;N
Do you think the corporate tax rate in America, being the second highest on the globe, is too high?;N
And are you going to advocate for lowering the corporate tax rate to make us more competitive, including energy industries?;N
Do you think the stretch that the NLRB is making to try to keep Boeing from choosing where it manufactures its products is the overreach of regulation?;N
And I hope that, because of your experience, not only doing what's right for jobs in America, but also unabashedly representing the shareholders, for whom you hold a trust, that you will speak out against that kind of overreach that is unprecedented, really.;D
And I hope when you're confirmed that you will take that on as the spokesman for business and commerce in our country, that we've got to stop this.;N
And if you will be the spokesman that you have said you will be, this should be Exhibit A.;N
Senator Lautenberg.--the inference that it's rule and regulation that are killing business, is baloney, you'll forgive me.;N
And the company that you were associated with, the Edison Electric, the company I was associated with, you're going to have 42,000 employees, I think it is, the number in Commerce.;N
The company I started with--two guys, four working people, now has 45,000 employees that--we worked from scratch, and we built an incredible company, with the best record for growth of any company in America--10 percent or better.;N
So, I submit to you--a little more confidence in your experience and your ability, and an ability to make decisions.;D
When you're here, you're sitting before a jury, and you have to present those things that you think are going to help grow our commercial opportunities at home and abroad.;N
So, I would look to you to be able to stir up your belief in things, and get the job done.;N
And, if you were to be able to get this job, to land this one, then you will have made a great contribution to America's well-being.;N
We know that changes in ocean chemistry caused by carbon dioxide will affect our food supply, the health of our oceans.;N
Now, I wrote a provision that became law in 2009 requiring NOAA to lead an interagency effort to study the effects of ocean acidification.;N
Would you say here that you're going to continue the administration's commitment to a better understanding in addressing this growing point resulting from a change in temperatures--or whatever the causes are--but, to make sure that we try to restructure these things so that we don't lose the opportunity that comes from an ocean that's pure, that has coral alive, that is a place where fish and sea life gets its growing strength?;N
And, with coral out of existence, the fish and the other sea life doesn't have a chance to find a place to propagate and develop.;N
"And, I certainly respect and appreciate what both of you have done--what you've done a National Geographic; and what you've done in your career, Mr. Bryson.";D
And it goes well beyond energy executive, because of the boards you've served on and all the other things you've done.;D
I have, he's made a lot more business decisions than I have, and I have a lot of respect for him.;D
Were you, you were on the board when they made the decision to locate the new facility in South Carolina, then?;N
I think it, the message to everybody--you know, I'm from Missouri, where we have a lot of Boeing employees.;N
But, I think one of the messages here is, if you're in a right-to-work state, or you're coming to the United States for the first time, until this is settled, that may be one reason not to come to Missouri, because you can't move, you can't put your second location somewhere that's not part of that first location in a non-right-to-work state.;N
I just think this is one of the areas where a Secretary of Commerce--if you're not fighting this attitude in any administration, nobody is.;N
Whether it's in regulatory efforts, or the taxing efforts, or what the utility bill might be, all of those become reasons not to take a risk.;N
It's a lot easier to not put your money on the table to see if you can lose it, than it is to put it on the table and see if you can lose it.;N
And whether it's the EPA or--I agree with Senator Hutchison, that the, this NLRB rule is something that, if somehow the Congress wanted to enact this as a new national standard, that's one thing--and I wouldn't be for it--but, to have these rulemaking agencies think they can make these big stretches into new areas of law is a real concern.;N
And it stands against the number one priority of the government of the country today, which should be private sector job creation.;N
And, I mean, as a member of that board, do you have particular concerns about how that decision by your board, well taken and well entered into, has created this new set of problems?;N
And you know how a little difference makes the difference in whether you make the decision or not.;N
And, in my view, the advocacy of the risk-reward philosophy of capitalism is a key job of the Secretary of Commerce.;N
If you don't understand risk-reward, and don't respect it as a driving component of growing the economy, the economy doesn't grow.;N
And I think that's a lot of what we're seeing right now, is, this lack of certainty creates incredible hesitancy, which means nobody takes a chance.;N
If nobody takes a chance, other people don't get an opportunity that that chance would have provided for them.;N
I am concerned about a sense that the California model is the right utility model for us to follow.;N
not only they don't make us competitive, they drive these jobs to countries that care a whole lot less about what comes out of the smokestack than we do.;N
And so, the overall goal, environmental goal, is actually set back, instead of moved forward, by policies that drive jobs from our country to other countries.;N
Let's go back to what I was discussing earlier, because I think it is so paramount in focusing on job creation.;N
And in fact, yesterday I was trying to describe an initiative that I had offered two and a half years ago, to your predecessor, which was to have a job creation coordinator because of the disparate organizations and structures within the Commerce Department, to centralize the focus and bring everybody forward in a coordinated, synchronized fashion.;N
When I look at the overall picture of what the Commerce mission is, and what the reality is of the economy today, they're totally misaligned.;N
In fact, we are at a point where, since January of 2009 unemployment has fallen below 9 percent for 5 months only.;N
I mean, we know what we have to create--285,000 jobs a month in the next 5 years to get back to pre-recession levels of 2007.;N
If you look at your mission to strengthen the international economic position of the United States, less that 1 percent of U.S. businesses engage in exporting.;N
If you look at your mission to promote aggressive business policies that help America's businesses and entrepreneurs, we talk about the cost of regulations for small employers.;N
A March 2011 report by the Manufacturing Institute on education reform said at the height of the recession, 32 percent of manufacturers reported they had jobs going unfilled.;N
Back in 1981, when we first passed the Research and Development Tax Credit bill--and I was in the House at that time--the United States of America had the most generous tax treatment for research among all of the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD.;N
That's why you have an opportunity to do something so important for the President, and most especially, for the country, and using the resources of your Department to bring it forward.;N
As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I cannot underscore enough the difficulty and the barriers that regulations present to small businesses and large businesses alike.;N
I have talked to businesses of all sizes, all across America and, of course, including my own in Maine.;N
When people say it doesn't matter--because I've argued this issue on the Floor, and there's a lot of resistance to the notion of regulatory reform.;N
Just in this state of California, regulations--just on the state level--cost $177 billion a year, or $493 billion, if you count the indirect costs.;N
And think about the onerous burden that presents to businesses of all sizes across this country.;N
That's why I hope you will use your voice and the force of the office on the whole issue of regulations, and to the President.;N
So, there's no one person in the offices of the Commerce Department who is tasked with analyzing and assessing the impact overall of these regulations on businesses.;N
So, I would urge you to consider that, and to make sure that you drive that initiative, because it's so critically important.;N
And I applaud you, because I think that is going to be really important at a time that that voice needs to be heard here at the Federal level, and most especially, from the department that you will represent.;N
And it's, and all my other concerns have been outlined here today in the questions and in the opening statements.;N
But, just briefly, again, I hope something you will focus on, both of you will focus on, and that is the issue of our broken visa process that we have here in the country.;N
We can't be the only country in the world that doesn't have them and doesn't enforce them.;N
On the other hand, it's important to note that our broken visa process is hurting our economy in multiple ways.;N
Certainly, folks in the tourism industry will tell you that our market share in tourism is suffering from the inability to get folks to come here.;N
I think people in business will tell you they're struggling to get buyers into their trade shows or into their warehouses and places of interest.;N
Entrepreneurial--and we should be looking and actively searching for ways to bring entrepreneurs to this country to invest and create countries--;N
Certainly, folks in your home state, in California and in other places, will tell you that in the high-;N
So, certainly, we have some deficiencies in the visa programs that I hope can be addressed from a pro-business perspective.;N
And I hope that both of you will make that a priority in your time that--we discussed that.;N
We have many workers that I think could do better if they were focused more on retraining in technical colleges and those kinds of things.;N
And I think that our education system needs to adjust to this new economy, where it's not just your grandpa's Vo-Tech anymore, that, actually, people who are getting 2-year degrees are doing incredibly better than some people that are getting 4-year degrees.;N
And, that our high schools should be working better with the technical schools in terms of that focus.;N
Could you comment on that, and how the Department of Commerce could help workers learn new skills when they get laid off, or there are less jobs in the industry that they're in?;N
The, I have found that in certain areas of our state, like northern Minnesota--beautiful resort areas--they're at a competitive disadvantage, because the resorts in Canada have more Internet access.;N
So, of course, people are booking there instead of going to Grand Moray, or some of the beautiful communities on the north shore.;N
And, could you just briefly talk--I know Senator Kerry has to get to the vote--about your commitment to the broadband expansion in this country?;N
I've been watching on the--but I suppose, since you're going to be the deputy, you can just say ``ditto'' to everything.;N
I've been listening, actually, back in my office, and I heard a number of my colleagues, particularly, secretary--;N
secretary--Senator Blunt and some others refer to tax rates, and to the lack of certainty.;N
And I would say to my friends on the other side of the isle--there's nobody here now, obviously, and you don't have to answer this--but, it would help a lot to provide certainty if we could get a little less ideological rigidity, and get an agreement on the budget fast.;N
And the idea of turning our heads on the experts' predictions that we need to get something like $4 trillion of savings--about $3 trillion out of policy and $1 trillion out of debt--and that everything they're talking about now fall shy of that, the idea that anybody's living up to a responsible challenge here, without revenue, is simply absurd.;N
But, I will say, as my colleagues talk about certainty--the certainty we could send to the marketplace if we got a deal that was reasonable and rational, as we did under President Reagan.;N
When President Reagan, for whom Defense cuts were an anathema, agreed to have 50 percent of the sequestration come out of Defense, and 50 percent came out of entitlements and domestic discretionary.;N
What we're doing here, around here, right now is simply not rational, and I wish our colleagues were here, because I wouldn't hesitate to say this if they were.;N
And we need to put it on the table and get it done, because your task is going to be 20 times harder if we're struggling to get this already fragile economy moving, and we're not investing in infrastructure--which hasn't been talked about here today.;N
We're not investing in, the sort of the basics of our, to break that down, air control system, our rail, or transit, all these things that matter in getting products to the marketplace.;N
The other thing I want to straighten out is, I'm kind of tired of hearing about the odorous tax rates that corporations are paying in America, when in fact they don't pay those rates.;N
The effective tax rate in the United States among OECD countries--about 30 nations--is about 14 to 18--midway to less than midway.;N
And I think people, you know, I mean, you know, John Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'';N
And a lot of folks around here in Washington keep making them up, or sticking with their own facts.;N
Now, as I said earlier, there are a lot of issues that fall before this committee, and there are a lot of things--I wear the hat as the Chair of the Communications Technology Subcommittee, and we are working on privacy, and the whole information management issue, and there's a lot to talk to you about on that.;N
Fishing in New England as a whole, from Maine all the way down through New York, is an old-time, long-standing way of making a living, and it's a huge part of our culture and history, and our tourism, and it's a big thing.;N
We have two of the largest ports in the Nation for the landing of fish, in Gloucester and in New Bedford.;N
And so, but, the relationship--under the Bush administration there were some excesses in terms of the regulatory process that are still not yet rectified completely.;N
And they've moved, and made a number of different steps to try to build the relationship and confidence of our fishermen.;N
So, number one, I want to ask you, will you commit to coming up to our state, spend a day, half a day, whatever you can with us, to meet with our fishermen, bring people together, and listen to them, and help us work through--I think one of the best things we can do--Congressman Frank, Congressman Tierney, others, have proposed this also--that we create a task force that looks at the way in which regulations have been applied, and see if we can't find a better, more simple, more understandable, easier way of regulating the fisheries so that the fishermen have confidence that the decisions are being based on science, and common sense at the same time?;N
I know you've got a lot of things to, you know, when you get sworn in, and, to get going on.;N
The second thing is, would you be willing to establish, I guess under your own aegis, if you were to undertake to put together this task force--not just come and visit, but investigate both the economic and regulatory issues.;N
One of the problems we've had is, the Governor submitted important data to the Secretary, and there are some difficulties in the regulatory interpretation.;N
Maybe it doesn't, the law doesn't always make sense, as you know from law school and from practice.;N
And, I'd just like to get a commitment from you that we can really work to continue the process that Secretary Locke put in place, and make progress.;N
Because we have the vote on, I need to get there and not keep the vote from being--the vote clock has expired, so I have to magically get there with no time left and cast my vote.;N
So, you are, Secretary-designates and Under Secretary- designates, you are saved by the votes here in the U.S. Senate.;N
The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will come to order, and I'd like to thank our witness for being here, Mr. Huerta, who is the nominee to be the FAA Administrator and our colleague from the Committee Senator Boxer.;N
I'm presiding at the request of the chairman of the full Committee, who is here, and I'm going to go ahead and make an opening statement.;N
Madam Chairman, may I ask a point--make a point of personal privilege, a request to my friends?;N
I'm in the middle of literally 24-7 negotiations on the highway bill and it's going well, and I'm due to meet with Chairman Mica.;N
Do you mind if I just gave one and a half minutes of praise for this wonderful man and then charge out the door?;N
Well, it's going to turn to you and Senator Rockefeller momentarily to resolve the last few issues.;N
So I will ask unanimous consent to place my entire statement into the record at this time and I will summarize.;N
I'm so pleased with the nomination of Mr. Michael Huerta to be Administrator of the FAA, and I want to congratulate Michael and his family.;N
So this is a tested gentleman, and the leadership roles he played at the Port of San Francisco, at the Salt Lake City Olympics, as chief of staff for the Secretary of Transportation under the Clinton Administration, will serve him well.;D
So in closing, I want to just note and pay tribute to a number of families, family members of victims of the tragic crash of Flight 3407 near Buffalo in 2010.;N
They're here in the audience today, and they're here to remind us all of what is at stake when it comes to the need for adequate safety regulations.;D
I know Mr. Huerta carries that responsibility very close to his heart, and I believe his breadth of experience and leadership make him an excellent choice to fill the role of Administrator at the FAA.;D
I want to thank my friends on the Committee, all of you, for this opportunity, and I look forward to a swift confirmation.;N
Certainly NextGen is the biggest thing on your plate and we all are going to want to know what the setbacks are and how you're going to proceed forward.;N
Number one is the U.S. Office of Special Counsel wrote to Congress raising concerns about ongoing safety lapses at the FAA, some of which we certainly have read about in the newspapers with the air traffic controllers.;N
The counsel strongly recommended that more rigorous oversight measures be put in place at the Department and the FAA.;N
Second, the current Federal budget realities require every agency to have cost-cutting measures, and I will want to hear what you're doing in that regard.;N
So with that, let me say that I think you have stepped in at a big time at the FAA and you have kept the trains running on time, so I will look forward to hearing your testimony and then asking you a few questions.;N
Again, Mr. Huerta, thank you for your willingness to serve and thank you for your testimony this morning.;N
There are several rulemakings that are required under the FAA Extension Act of 2010 and some of those rulemakings for new flight and duty time rules have been completed and others haven't.;N
In the hearings that we had in the aftermath of the Colgan 3407 flight, one of the issues identified was the shortcoming of pilot training and co-pilot training.;N
That was one of the issues in the Colgan Air case, the amount of time in commuting, pilots showing up after long distance travel.;N
What else can we do to address some of these issues, given that, obviously, we want to implement the right rules, but 2013 is a long time.;N
Well, let me start with the Office of Special Counsel and also the relatively large number, according to the Special Counsel, of whistleblowers at the FAA.;N
What oversight measures are you putting in place in response to that report, or what measures are you taking to assure that there is some way to assure that an air traffic controller isn't taking a nap on the job or leaving the tower?;N
Mr. Huerta, one of the things that you read about and hear about are how difficult it is to discipline and fire if necessary a Federal employee because there are so many requirements and it's a bureaucratic tough situation.;N
All of us have--well, not all of us, but I've certainly been in a Federal agency myself and I know there are a lot of rules and sometimes it's been difficult even if someone was not doing their job and had all the requirements.;N
essential personnel, like an air traffic controller or a mechanic, have you had trouble with the bureaucratic constraints or union activity that would keep you from taking an action that you felt is necessary to assure that a person not doing the job is not able to stay on the job?;N
I do have another quick question, and that is what steps are you taking to live within the lower budgets that we're going to have across the board until we get the deficits down and the debt under control?;N
What measures are you taking that would suggest that you could do things more efficiently and that you're doing the part for your agency?;N
Thank you, and I just want to go over the order of members because people have come in and out of the hearing room.;N
We'll next call on Senator Thune, who's the ranking member on the Subcommittee, followed by Senator Begich, if Senator Boxer reappears, then Senator Lautenberg, then my other colleagues.;N
I want to thank you and the Ranking Member for holding the confirmation hearing today, and Mr. Huerta for appearing before the Committee as the nominee to be the next Administrator of the FAA.;N
I think we have to acknowledge that FAA operates the largest and safest air space system in the world.;N
As we know, since the mid-1990s the commercial air carrier accident rate has fallen by nearly 80 percent.;N
Achieving that low of a U.S. air carrier accident rate while transporting almost 800 million passengers per year is no simple feat.;N
But, having said that, even with the high rate of safety, improvements can be made, and last month's letter from the Office of Special Counsel, which cited 178 FAA disclosures, of which 97 were safety-related, is a startling reminder that safety's got to be a top priority.;N
The agency faces several other future challenges, including reducing regulatory burdens, streamlining its operations, maintaining professionalism in its work force, and implementing the recently enacted FAA Modernization and Reform Act.;N
So I appreciate, Mr. Huerta, hearing from you about your ideas on how to address those many challenges.;N
We have a bill, Senate bill 1956, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act that Senator McCaskill and I and others have introduced, which gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure America's aviation operators are not penalized by any system unilaterally imposed by the EU.;N
We had a hearing about this recently in front of this committee and I'm wondering what your thoughts are about whether this legislation might help you in your negotiations with the European Union.;N
Wouldn't having a legislative solution give you additional leverage in confronting the Europeans on this issue and dealing with it?;N
At the same time, you've got this thing already in effect, essentially, and lots of American air carriers covered by it and in many cases having to pass those costs on.;N
It seems to me at least that the legislation would at least provide temporary relief from this until such time as you can work through the appropriate forum, if that's ICAO, to get the right resolution in place.;N
So it just seems to me at least that it gives you one more piece of ammunition, one more tool, if you will, in dealing with the EU if you had Congress on the record and giving our air carriers in this country some relief from what is an unfair violation of international law and sovereignty of the United States.;N
There is a recent IG report that highlighted that the FAA has not yet established total program cost, schedule, or performance baseline for all of the six NextGen transformational programs.;N
When does the agency plan to do this, since without baselining we will not have complete information about when these programs will be completed, what they will deliver, and how much they're going to cost the American taxpayer?;N
The other three of the six that you said that have not--that are not baselined, when do you expect?;N
As you know, the general aviation community from my State and Senator Thune's, others, it's very important, the rural aspect of it.;N
Our concern is, and as you know, FAA is ultimately responsible for certifying the type of gas that goes into aviation or into airplanes.;N
We are--I want to make it very clear that we are hopeful that there are no moves by EPA or FAA to phaseout avgas until there is truly an appropriate and economical drop-in substitute fuel.;N
When we converted a much higher level of leaded gas to unleaded, which was our vehicles, it took many, many, many years to do that.;N
I'm worried that EPA has a different view of life here, that they can flip the switch and make it all magic.;N
I'm glad that you have made the statement you just said, because I think you understand the FAA component of this and the aviation component of this.;N
Will you keep us, at least our office, informed if there are some milestones occurring that we need to be aware of, because I guarantee you we'll hear very quickly in Alaska and we want to make sure we're on top of this issue.;N
The administration in the 2013 budget had the $100 user fee on GA, general aviation users.;N
It's going to create another bureaucracy within FAA, and the reality is we already have a system that general aviation supports and always works with FAA on.;N
I know it's a budget issue and I'm sure OMB has their views on it, but from a practical implication of how you implement it, it seems like it's creating another system that we don't need when we have a user fee tax that people have been accustomed to and have been supportive in the past of adjusting when necessary.;N
I think the general aviation folks, aviation in general, I think always are happy to--if there is a process and they know the value comes back to the users in this case, they're always willing to sit down and work these issues out.;N
Do you--I just want to follow up on what Senator Thune talked about on NextGen, if I can, and that is just very quickly, and that is you talked about the baselines, three more to go.;N
If you were to say--if you could give a percentage of where do you think you're at with full implementation of NextGen in the level that we had asked for in the FAA reauthorization bill, where would you say we are? 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent?;N
I know there are multiple pieces, but if you could take a 30,000 view looking down, where do you think we're at?;N
I'll look forward to supporting you in the final, but I just want to say thank you very much for coming here.;N
You were asked a question some minutes ago about what kind of performance we might expect if there is less funding.;N
The FAA authorization which was signed into law earlier this year exempts certain NextGen projects from environmental review.;N
The exemption has raised concerns in my region that there will be potentially more noise as a result of NextGen implementation.;N
That's critical, and that's a complaint that we hear about regularly and really in some instances very angrily, as you can imagine.;N
That is, I'd like your commitment that you're going to devote the time and energy to solving the Newark air traffic control problem that we wrestle with constantly.;N
As you and I talked about, as I said when we visited the other day, probably hard to find a group of 535 people that fly more or think they're more experts in air traffic, air travel, than Members of Congress.;N
But I've been impressed by the way you've been doing it and hope that moving permanently into the position allows you to finalize some things even in a better way.;N
On the pilot flight rule, at one point it looked to me like the FAA was moving toward having the same flight rules for passenger pilots as cargo pilots, which I didn't think was necessary.;N
"Is that the position the FAA will continue to have, that there's a different--the cargo pilots are under the rules that they've been working under and you're moving the passenger pilots to other rules; is that the status?";N
But you're not requiring them--you're requiring them to abide by the provisions of the previous rules, right?;N
On the cost of that, I noticed there was a wide discrepancy--I think the FAA thought that cargo companies complying with the rule would cost about $30 million and they thought $600 million.;N
Have you looked more carefully at that cost-benefit, how they could have that big a number, how the numbers could be that widely divergent?;N
I'd like to--this cost-benefit--I think there are going to be more and more pressures on cost-benefit generally as regulation is becoming a bigger and bigger concern at all levels.;N
On the FAA training and conference center, there's language in the Senate appropriations bill that directs the FAA to continue to pursue new leased space for that center.;N
What's your ongoing plan for how to look at the future of how you're going to conduct those training facilities, moving people in and out of one training facility to get their training?;N
I do know that in Kansas City, which bid for this, they had invested lots of money in that bid, which is also something that the FAA needs to think about.;N
When you go out for bid and you have competitive bidders making substantial investments to try to make that work, and then just decide, well, maybe that's not what we needed, you probably ought to pull that trigger when you're a little more sure of where you're headed, though economic circumstances clearly are different than they may have been a handful of years ago when that discussion could have started.;N
Will you make a decision on whether to go for bids that include training or whether to go for bids that only include facilities at some point, do you think?;N
In a sense, it just depends on who contracts with them, you or the successful bidder for the training?;N
We're a global marketplace, and it's really important that this is done in a timely fashion.;N
Can you comment a little bit on perhaps some ideas that you have how we can do a better job of that in the future, and any proposals that you've got in solving that problem?;N
You know, we talked a lot about jobs and the economy, which we can't talk too much about it.;N
In relation to that, I understand that we're moving more toward a risk-based safety oversight.;N
Would certification be one of those things that either is going to be done in that way more or something to be considered in that regard?;N
Again, it does seem like--and I think we're really saying the same thing--that with the certification process, that some things people need to devote more time to than other things.;N
And thank you so much, Acting Administrator Huerta, for being here today and answering our questions in a straightforward manner.;N
Additionally, smaller airports, which are central to rural commerce--we have a lot of them in my state--often struggle to get the funds needed for infrastructure updates for airports and runways.;N
The local match requirement for small airport projects recently doubled from 5 to 10 percent.;N
I'm concerned about the effect that this new requirement would force--that it could force small airports, which in the scheme of things aren't as small as some, like the one we have in Duluth, and elsewhere, to delay completion of critical infrastructure projects that were under way before the higher local match went into effect.;N
I don't think it's fair to change the rules midstream, and I hope you'll work to find a way to help these airports complete their projects, because it's obviously very important.;N
You can't just change the rules midstream and then expect everything to keep going as planned.;N
So I'm going to be in Duluth tomorrow--we've had some major flooding up there--and was just wondering what I can tell them about this.;N
Then also I hope you can commit to making sure that cold weather airports, such as the ones you just discussed, Bemidji, Duluth, get the flexibility they need to complete infrastructure improvements with the short construction season issue.;N
This is, again, they're waiting for awarded funds to be released so they can try to get this construction done through the summer season.;N
Otherwise I'm going to make you come to Duluth when it's 20 below zero and do construction.;N
I understand that in the final order of the new regulations that it only applied to commercial pilots.;N
I know Senator Cantwell touched on this, and that some pilots commute across the country to their hubs and we have the issue where the FAA isn't following through with this request from the Inspector General about this particular commuting issue.;N
I was failing to watch the clock and you weren't rude at all, and I was taking time that should have gone to others and did.;N
What I was going to ask you about was on--we talked about the Columbia, Missouri, airport the other day.;N
On these airports like that, that have moved off Essential Air Service, are there things that the FAA can do to encourage their ability to stay off Essential Air Service?;N
Have you got some ideas there of ways that those kinds of airports that need to be planning for more travelers and more service could get some assistance in doing that?;N
I think as these airports move to where they're not getting the Essential Air Service support, things that we can do to help them stay there are really beneficial and make money.;N
As long as we have an Essential Air Service program, when we can help people stay off of it, it's hard to imagine that that's not a better investment than the VSA support that we normally would give those same airports.;N
What I need to do now is, because we've got--Senator Klobuchar, who's finishing her third book over there, we----;N
So what I'd like to do, with your forbearance, is simply to recess this for a couple of minutes.;N
It is really a pleasure to be here this afternoon with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Hagan.;N
I want to thank you for holding quickly this important hearing and for the opportunity to introduce a friend and the Mayor of Charlotte, Anthony Foxx.;N
First, I want to publicly thank him for his commitment and his willingness to serve in this capacity.;D
I know it can't be easy to leave behind the beauty of North Carolina to come to Washington and to take on the challenges that come with this position.;N
I understand it is not the easiest transition, so I especially want to thank his wife, Samara, and his two children, Hillary and Zachary, for the support that they continue to give to him in what has been a very quick life of public service.;N
Anthony's leadership and his record of service has brought him before you today, and I am confident that he will serve our nation in the same manner that he served the people of North Carolina, specifically the city of Charlotte.;D
A homegrown talent, Anthony was born in Charlotte, where he attended West Charlotte High School before moving on to Davidson College.;D
While in undergrad, Anthony served as student body president, the first African-American to do so at Davidson.;D
His passion for public service awarded him the Root-Tilden Scholarship to study law at New York University.;D
Prior to joining DesignLine as Deputy General Counsel in 2009, Anthony worked as a Litigation Attorney at Hunton and Williams.;D
He has the distinction of serving in all three branches of the Federal Government: as a law clerk on the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a trial attorney for the Civil Rights Division of the United States Justice Department, and a staff counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives on the Judiciary.;D
Anthony began his political career in 2005 with his election to the city council as an at-large representative and served two terms before being elected Mayor on November 3, 2009.;D
And as mayor, Mayor Foxx has kept the charge of meeting and staying ahead of the needs of a major metropolitan area.;D
As mayor, he has done an outstanding job of building stronger relationships with state and Federal leaders to meet the infrastructure needs of a growing metropolitan area.;D
I commend the president for looking toward North Carolina for this kind of leadership, and I urge my colleagues to offer him their full consideration.;D
Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Thune and all of the members of the Committee, it certainly is a pleasure to be here with my colleague, Senator Burr, so that we both can welcome and introduce Anthony Foxx to you.;N
I also want to thank the Mayor's family for their steadfast service and commitment while he has served as Mayor of Charlotte and moved through this nomination process.;D
So I am honored to have the opportunity to introduce a man who has been a tremendous asset to our entire state.;D
While it is going to be sad to see him leave Charlotte and the Charlotte government process, I am pleased that when he is confirmed the entire country will benefit from Anthony Foxx's leadership as Secretary of Transportation.;D
He earned an undergraduate degree, as you have heard, in history from Davidson College in North Carolina and did blaze a trail as the school's first African-American student body president.;D
He received a law degree from New York University and has held positions in all three branches of the Federal Government.;D
Beginning as a judicial clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Anthony Foxx went on to become a lawyer for the Department of Justice and counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.;D
In 2005, he was elected as an at-large member of the Charlotte City Council, and during his 4 years of service as councilman, he chaired the Transportation Committee and was a member of the Economic Development and Planning Committee.;D
Since 2009, he has served as the mayor of Charlotte, one of our country's fastest-growing cities.;D
Given his experience and the strength of his resume, it is hard to believe that Anthony could be one of the youngest Cabinet secretaries in history.;D
Through his tireless efforts, he helped attract and create more than 8,400 new jobs in the Charlotte area.;D
Most importantly, he has been a true champion of transportation and infrastructure development, securing forward-looking investments in Charlotte's roads, airport, and mass transit.;D
"Under his leadership, the I-485 has been approved for expansion; he secured funding toward the completion of the Blue Line Light Rail Extension Project; and oversaw the opening of a third runway at the Charlotte International Airport.";D
All of these projects occurred as we worked and as we are still working to climb out of the recession.;N
South End, which is a historic Charlotte neighborhood which saw the city's first railroad line back in the 1850s, is being revitalized with the help of the LYNX light rail.;N
This neighborhood is now home to more than 750 small businesses and 11 new residential developments.;N
And investments at the Charlotte airport are establishing the city as an international hub.;N
With direct flights to London and soon to Brazil, Charlotte and North Carolina are increasingly connected to businesses across the world.;N
And the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which has been a top priority for the state of North Carolina for many years, is finally moving forward.;N
Sixty thousand vehicles use one part of this roadway every day, and that number is expected to double by 2025.;N
The improvement project, which relied heavily on support from local leaders across the region, including Mayor Foxx, is expanding and improving the integral roadway so it can really meet the needs of businesses and residents for years to come.;N
Anthony Foxx's direct experience working directly with transportation departments at the Federal, state, and local levels and his proven record of success make him well-prepared, Mr. Chairman, to serve as the next secretary of transportation.;D
I have worked closely with Mayor Foxx during my time in Washington, and I have the utmost confidence that he will serve in this role with great distinction.;D
I thank him for his service and willingness to step up when his service is needed, and I encourage a swift confirmation by this committee.;D
Now, I am not kicking you out, but I am offering you the opportunity to leave, because--unless you want to listen to John Thune and myself speak.;N
Mayor Foxx, I have to say, I have been here on this committee for 26, 27-something years, and I have never seen a greater press crush in my entire life.;N
I want to congratulate you, Mayor Foxx, be you seated or not--and you have to introduce your wife, for sure--on your nomination for the position of Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation.;N
As Secretary LaHood so ably demonstrated, the job requires a deep understanding of the policy and the political savvy to accomplish the administration's goals, all of which in an era of constraint which doesn't seem to relax.;N
Despite this, the department is tasked with implementing a large number of new safety mandates and simultaneously presiding over a transportation infrastructure network in need of significant and immediate investment.;N
The country's transportation network has been a critical factor in our long-term economic growth.;N
However, years of underinvesting in our roads, airports, air traffic control systems, rails, and ports have left us with an overstrained transportation system.;N
And I think that is probably the greatest weak link in our national economic picture, only to get much worse.;N
I believe we are on the brink of losing our competitive edge in the global marketplace as a result.;N
The evidence is clear that this interconnected system was not built to withstand the wear and the tear that it is forced to endure today.;N
Instead, we have grown accustomed to an ad hoc approach to investing in our transportation network by using a grab bag of unrelated pay-;N
Too many seem content with this approach, but I certainly am not and I don't think you are.;N
Turning our backs on this growing problem ignores what we truly need, desperately need in this country: a strategic, long-term vision for rebuilding our transportation system in all of its forms.;N
We need to take a hard look at what we need from our ports, rail, air, and highway systems over the long term and commit to making appropriate investments.;N
We must get away from overly siloed, programmatic funding mechanisms that don't allow for flexibility necessary to make strategic multimodal investments.;N
In short, we need to rethink how we fund transportation in this country as we look, hopefully, toward a future.;N
We all need to come together--the Congress, the White House, and the stakeholder community--and truly explore all options.;N
Now, and I should tell you that we, the Commerce Committee, has now very much become a consumer affairs committee and a safety committee, looking out for little things that we sort of looked past in years past.;N
Since becoming chairman, I really have worked on protection of people and safety as a priority.;N
For transportation, I hope I have your commitment on this across the department, and I am sure I will.;N
While we have required new safety requirements across the air, rail, and highway systems, the work has only just begun.;N
The department needs do everything in its power to implement these safety requirements in a timely way.;N
"We are very good at passing rules and, you know, legislation and then others pass rules and regulations; then they never get implemented.";N
I am concerned about delays we are seeing on some very important issues and worried about more.;N
Should you be confirmed, I need your help in making sure that these new requirements are put in place as soon as possible.;N
On the aviation side, it has been a tough year, between the challenges involving the 787 and sequestration impacts.;N
Unfortunately, we face the same difficulties next year and into the future until we come to our collective senses.;N
All of this has taken attention away from other key efforts, such as modernizing the air traffic control system, which is sort of the thing I care most about but get to talk least about because it has been pushed down the road by the situation we are faced with.;N
I expect you to make a renewed effort to focus the agency on implementing new pilot qualification and training requirements.;N
Implementing the NextGen air traffic control system, as I indicated, is of personal importance for me.;N
The system is vital to the future of our air transportation network, and I will continue to make it a priority.;N
"This will take communication and transparency from the department; it will take honesty and frankness from us.";N
Before I turn this over to my distinguished friend, Senator Thune, I should point out that, one, we have two votes at 4 o'clock.;N
And then on the questions, everybody will have 7-minute rounds rather than 5-minute rounds.;N
This hearing gives our committee the opportunity to perform one of the most important constitutional responsibilities provided to members of the United States Senate, the power to give advice and consent on the president's executive and judicial nominees.;N
Today we are going to consider Mayor Anthony Foxx to be the 17th Secretary of Transportation.;N
Established in 1967, the Department of Transportation employs approximately 53,000 full-time employees and has over $72 billion in budget authority.;N
If confirmed, Mayor Foxx, not only will you be responsible for overseeing this important agency, but you will also be the principal advisor to the President on all matters relating to transportation.;D
I know most of the individuals here today understand what an important position this is for our country, but every American is directly affected by our nation's transportation systems, including through personal and business travel, employment, the interstate movement of the products we grow, manufacture, and purchase, and their impact on the overall health of our economy.;N
The average American family spends roughly 17 percent of their total budget on transportation-related costs, and $1.6 trillion, or almost 10 percent of the U.S. GDP, is comprised of transportation-related goods and services.;N
Even a rural state like my home state of South Dakota is directly impacted by the decisions made by the Secretary of Transportation.;N
For instance, the regulations produced by the DOT have a direct impact on the ability of Daktronics, an industry leader in electronic scoreboards and display systems located in Brookings, South Dakota, to produce and sell dynamic message signs used on freeways and roadways to provide instructions, travel times, and road conditions to motorists.;N
DOT components like the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Highway Administration play an important role in maintaining a robust national airspace and highway system to transport agriculture goods to market, enable tourists to visit South Dakota's many historic sites like Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, and the Badlands, or enjoy our world-class pheasant hunting.;N
And regulations placed on truck safety by another DOT agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, impact more than 20,000 individuals in South Dakota employed by the trucking industry.;N
The secretary's decisions also shape the role the Federal Railroad Administration plays in ensuring our freight rail lines are safe so that South Dakota's agricultural goods can make it to market quickly and efficiently.;N
The position you are nominated for is certainly an important one, and to be successful the administration and Congress will need to work together to address the numerous transportation challenges we face ahead.;D
Mayor Foxx, I look forward to hearing your testimony today and to learning about you and your qualifications to be the next secretary of transportation.;N
Mayor Foxx, the oversight of the activities of government departments and agencies is a serious responsibility of all members of this committee.;N
If confirmed, do you pledge to give thorough and timely responses to requests for information and other correspondence to all members of this committee?;N
I would like to point out that there are several outstanding letters that I sent, along with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Shuster and with Chairman Rockefeller, to the FAA and DOT that remain unanswered.;N
They are items that, in my view, need to be fully answered before I can support your nomination being reported from the Committee.;N
And so I just wanted to make sure that, in terms of the responsiveness of the department to the members of this committee, that we would get your response on the record in terms of your intentions in that regard.;N
Let me ask you, there was the big issue that came up here in the last few months in the way that the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration handled spending reductions as a result of the Budget Control Act.;N
The DOT and the FAA had over a year to plan for implementation of reductions, but the poor planning resulted in disruptions in FAA staffing and delays for passengers across the country.;N
The Budget Control Act is the law of the land, and unless a grand bargain comes together, I think many of us agree that agency leaders should be prepared to plan for the contingencies of budget caps in the Budget Control Act.;N
And so my question is: what experiences have equipped you to plan toward delivering safe and efficient air traffic control services within the current budgetary realities?;N
Shifting modes here: As secretary, what role do you see yourself playing in the reauthorization process when it comes to MAP-21?;N
And I am wondering what your thoughts are with respect to that particular process and what role you see yourself playing in it.;N
With regard to this issue, there always seem to be more projects than there is funding, and I am curious, as mayor, how you have gone about setting priorities when it comes to determining which projects get funded and which don't.;N
The American people, a lot of people depend upon you, look to you, and need to be able to build trust.;N
Give me just a little bit of your thoughts about how you would build that kind of trust and credibility, not only with the people that would be under you but also with the American people who will be looking to you for leadership.;N
For my colleagues, it now says there are no votes before 4:35, so we can relax a little bit.;N
And my thanks to you and to your family for your willingness to serve and your service in the past.;N
As you know, my state has just been through a major transportation crisis, an incident that certainly speaks to the need for investment, not only in rail but in all forms of transportation, but most especially rail, because I think that this incident, an accident that could have cost even more lives, caused more injuries, and done even greater damage, fortunately was less severe than it might have been.;N
And that fact is due to the investment that was made in the most advanced, at least to date, the more advanced type of railroad cars, the M8 railcars, on the Metro-North line, which most likely prevented more injuries and limited the severity of the ones that occurred.;N
The lack of investment in our rail lines, in our tracks and other equipment, has left them without important quality and safety upgrades.;N
So I would like a commitment from you that you will prioritize investments in infrastructure and safety measures for all of our railroad lines but most especially in the Northeast Corridor.;N
And I think what that collision or accident shows is that our rail lines are deteriorated and outdated and decrepit in many sections of that Northeast Corridor.;N
I hope that you will take your message as a very articulate and powerful spokesperson on the road.;N
And I want to make you an offer that maybe you can refuse but I hope not: that you make one of your first trips to visit us in Connecticut, specifically in Bridgeport, and come with me to the site of that collision.;N
You have made the offer, and I am grateful for it, that you will work with me, but I would ask you to work with our entire delegation in developing a consensus around the Northeast Corridor rail financing plan.;N
And that really relates not only to Connecticut but really to the collection of states that depend on this vital artery--it is an artery--that right now is back in operation but for a time, because of that Bridgeport accident, was essentially choked and strangled in the ability to move people and freight and other essentials along that Northeast Corridor.;N
And I am hoping that you will work with our delegation and with representatives and senators from throughout our region.;N
Let me also ask about perhaps some of the advances in technology and science that have to do with rail transport that perhaps we can help to implement.;N
The National Transportation Safety Board, I will say very commendably, was on the scene literally within hours.;N
And I met with Earl Weener, the board member who was assigned to this responsibility, along with a very able team, that very next morning.;N
So we don't want to prejudge what the results will show, but I hope--here is my main point about the investigation--that it will be done more quickly than perhaps the projections are right now.;N
I hope that you will do whatever you can--I know it is an independent board--to assure that we know what the results are.;N
And in the less than a minute that I have left, I would like to ask for your continuing support for our air controllers and air control towers, the contract control towers, which we and the Congress have said are vital to air safety, economic development, and jobs in those areas served by the airport.;N
And after you visit Connecticut, I hope you also come to Minnesota and see our 10,000 lakes and our beautiful new Twins stadium.;N
And I think you would also see the Central Corridor, our light rail system, near up and running, as well as a number of highways that need a lot of work.;N
"I was just visiting just this past week with people near Rogers, Minnesota, where Highway 94 is a bottleneck in a certain area; U.S. Highway 10 in Anoka, Minnesota, which is adjacent to nine towns and is considered one of the fastest-growing corridors in the U.S.";N
While Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe did an amazing job getting that bill done, and Senator Rockefeller and this committee had a lot to do with that as well, there is more to be done.;N
And last Congress, I introduced the Rebuild America Jobs Act, which would have provided $50 billion for direct infrastructure investments.;N
"Some of the work that Senator Blumenthal talked about could have been paid for; some of the work that we saw needed to be done after that bridge collapsed in the middle of the Mississippi River just six blocks from my house on a beautiful summer day.";N
And as I said that day, when that eight-lane highway headed into that river, a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America, but it did.;N
This money is similar to what the president has put forth in his Fix It First proposal in his recent budget.;N
What do you suggest we do to get the kind of funding that we need to really get goods to market and make this country strong again for infrastructure?;N
And I think some strides have been made, but, as you know, it is still a major problem when you look at the statistics.;N
Well, now that you have your new job, you are going to be dealing with things like snowmobiles, something you might not have in North Carolina.;N
And I worked hard with several of my colleagues to ensure that the Recreational Trails Program was maintained in MAP-21.;N
RTP funds off-highway vehicle, snowmobile, and nonmotorized trail uses and derives its funding from gas taxes paid by off-highway vehicle users when they fill up their machines.;N
If confirmed, will you work to ensure that this valuable program continues to meet the needs of all trail users in Minnesota and across the nation?;N
One of the few industries to enjoy an exemption from antitrust laws is the freight railroad industry.;N
I know that Chairman Rockefeller has been working on the Surface Transportation Board reforms to address this issue.;N
Are you aware of the shipper concerns about the high prices that many shippers are paying--we call them captive shippers--;N
"Just remember the numbers 63 and 4. We used to have 63 rail carriers; we now have only 4 major rail carriers, which happens to be the exact number on the Monopoly board.";N
One of the most promising initiatives involved rewriting regulations for smaller airplanes.;N
It will enable better safety technologies to be fielded to address issues like loss of control, which is the number one case of general aviation accidents.;N
I am introducing a bill with Senator Murkowski of Alaska to push this effort forward at the Federal Aviation Administration.;N
And I hope you will look into this bill, and we would love to have your support for this work.;N
We have some other questions I will put on the record on air traffic controllers and towers, such an issue for so many of us, to make sure that they are maintained.;N
I think mayors have a sense of knowing on the front line what is going on, and we need that in a transportation secretary.;N
I was sitting here remembering the former mayor of Minneapolis, who is quite old now, but he once told me the story that he got a call on a Sunday from a constituent who said that the trash was not picked up in his neighborhood.;N
"And the Mayor said, ``You know what, look, buddy, I will give you the number of our public works person; you can call him directly today on a Sunday.''";N
And the constituent paused and he said, ``I know who that guy is, but I don't want to bother him on a Sunday.'';N
And so I think that you will be--as we talked, many of us believe Secretary LaHood did an amazing job in working with Members of Congress and local communities and mayors, understood that frontline ability to accomplish even more if you understand what people need in their areas and understand Senator Blumenthal's concerns about Connecticut.;N
And I hope that you will bring that forward from your work as a mayor and never let that go.;N
For the first time in my memory, we are breaking the order-of-arrival sanctity, and Senator Cowan has, with utmost graciousness, yielded his place to Senator Scott.;N
Senator Cowan, I thought it was perhaps because Mr. Rockefeller thought I was Senator Cowan.;N
In the spirit of getting the last word on this, I am glad we are both here together so we can put truth to the rumor that there is only one of us.;N
This probably is perhaps the most amazing confirmation process I have seen so far in my short term in the Senate.;N
I will tell you that so often I hear pointed questions with pointed responses and a lot of deliberation about nothing.;N
Today I have heard very kind comments and perhaps still a lot of deliberation so far about nothing.;N
I would say that, as your neighbor to the south, the tolling impact would be harmful from our perspective.;N
So we hope that you take a serious look at the entire corridor as it relates to the tolling process.;N
TIGER grants have been celebrated as a success, providing much-needed resources to the local level.;N
I will tell you that there seems to be, according to GAO and the DOT inspector general, they have both raised some concerns as to how the awards are made.;N
How do you plan to ensure that these grant projects will be selected on a transparent, merit-based system?;N
I would tell you that a project-specific, merit-based system would be welcomed versus what sometimes appears to be a district-specific, red districts versus blue districts, funding formula that seems to be en vogue at times.;N
My final question--and I will try to do something that seems to perhaps be celebrated by my colleague from the North, is to reserve and give back the balance of my time, which I want you to pay attention to that, as we have 7 minutes instead of 5.;N
I would hope that you would find it within your approach to being the secretary of transportation where you would find alternative solutions as opposed to having a user fee, which would of course be cumbersome and challenging in the aviation footprint.;N
Congratulations to you and your family, your lovely wife, Samara, and your beautiful children.;N
If confirmed, I am confident you will be--as I hope you will be, and I am sure you will be--you will serve this country well as the head of DOT.;N
It is clear from our conversation not just the other day but conversations you and I have had in your capacity as Mayor of the Queen City of North Carolina and mine as Chief of Staff of the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts that you truly understand the importance of transportation, not just the means from getting from here to there, but as a method of opening up economic opportunity, creating jobs, and fostering healthier communities.;N
And I hope that we continue to have a rich conversation today about projects that are critical to Massachusetts that you know are near and dear to my heart.;N
"I know Governor Patrick has spoken with you about this previously; you and I talked about it last week.";N
This is a project that I think is a great example of the transformative power of transportation, rail in particular, which would open up the entire south coast region of Massachusetts to opportunity untold.;N
We have been working for years to try to bring this to fruition, and I thank Secretary LaHood for his efforts on that behalf.;N
That said, you know, we are still not where we need to be, and we have been working with the Army Corps of Engineers to try to move things along.;N
And so my first question to you is, when you come up north to visit Senator Blumenthal and the folks in Connecticut, I trust you will stop in Massachusetts, come see where we are on the South Coast Rail project.;N
And I hope I can get your commitment that you will continue to look at this project for what it is, a great opportunity not just for Massachusetts but the whole northeast region and the Nation to spur economic activity, and that you will work with us and the Army Corps of Engineers to move this project along, a project that is long delayed.;D
"You come anytime; I would be happy to drive you down there myself and see all the prosperity that is just waiting to unleash.";N
This is a project that former Governor Mitt Romney signed into law as a condition of the so-;N
And we have had some starts and fits with Transportation, who wanted to see more of an effort on the state side.;N
And as I mentioned to you last week, that effort is in place and the results are there, and we are ready to move forward.;N
When you come to visit, you will sit with our state transportation officials and the local officials in Somerville, Medford, and the surrounding towns to talk about the economic opportunity that, again, is waiting for this rail line to bring forth.;N
And the last Massachusetts-specific project, because I am sure some of my colleagues are growing weary of me talking about Massachusetts projects, but the Worcester Airport.;N
Secretary LaHood has been very cooperative and a great partner with us in opening up that modal for expanded growth in the second-largest city in Massachusetts, which is in the center of the state.;N
And I am pleased to say that, while I was saddened to see Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray today announce that he was stepping down, I am pleased that he is going to run the Worcester Chamber of Commerce.;N
I am hoping that you will take the time to see how, again, that airport, that venue is going to open up the region and you will continue the support that Secretary LaHood has been providing in recent years.;N
Last but not least, Mr. Mayor, I would love to hear you talk a little more--Senator Klobuchar talked about the infrastructure bank.;N
And you mentioned, I believe, in your response that you see value in the infrastructure bank.;N
Could you expound on that a little bit and perhaps any other thoughts you may have about how we take advantage of what little resources we have right now or what new resources are needed to really grow our infrastructure and deal with some of the state-of-repair issues that you and I know are holding us back, so that we can make sure our roads and bridges are safe and productive for our economic needs?;N
Senator Fischer--welcome you to the Committee and appreciate you taking the time to be here to answer our questions.;N
As we discussed in our meeting, I previously served as Chair of the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee in the Nebraska legislature, and so I have a huge interest in infrastructure issues.;N
I believe infrastructure is a core responsibility, a core priority for government, and at the Federal level I believe it is only second to our national security.;N
Whether it is roads, bridges, ports, airports, infrastructure is the backbone of our economy and helps to maintain strong communities all across this country.;N
It plays an important role in the funding and the managing of our national infrastructure system.;N
However, this must be in a responsible manner that is worthy of those hard-earned taxpayer dollars.;N
We need to figure out how we are going to stretch the revenue that we have available so that we can meet the needs all across this country.;N
As we talked about looking for those efficiencies when you were in my office, I asked you if you had any examples.;N
I am wondering at this time if you have had the opportunity to visit with some people in the department in order to maybe tell me some examples where you might look for efficiencies within that huge department.;N
Nebraska is a state of distances, and we understand the importance of our highway system in order to promote commerce, in order to promote the safety of citizens all across our state, in order to connect us all.;N
And we are concerned, as other states are across this country, about lack of sufficient revenue to not just maintain our roads and maintain our bridges so that they are in safe condition and can handle added capacity as needed but we need to build.;N
You know, we can talk about an infrastructure bank, but that is not going to work either unless we have a dedicated source of revenue going into it.;N
And thank you for your openness and willingness to work together on these very, very important issues that are before us.;N
And thank you, Mayor Foxx, for being here and stepping up and being willing to take this responsibility.;N
I don't want to repeat a lot of things that you have already been asked and probably answered for the few minutes I was gone.;N
You know, I think a third of the air traffic controllers right now are eligible to retire, and a significant number of them are about to get to the mandatory retirement time.;N
So there has just been this training proposal of a training facility that has been out there and almost got awarded a few years ago.;N
And my view would be that I hope we can continue to pursue how we get that training into a system that works better than the moving-around training that is going now.;N
And, you know, the other thing that I think we all need to collectively work on is figuring out a strategy of how to prioritize furloughs and other things.;N
And you are starting at a time when it is pretty obvious what happens when we are not all open with each other about that.;N
And, you know, we had the FAA administrator in just 48 hours before they announced a lot of air traffic controller furloughs, and I think he was asked, I guess not quite directly enough, but pretty directly in a way that should have gotten more information than we got.;N
You know, a lot of the things I think we want to send to your--almost unfair to--they are technical enough in nature.;N
I just think we need to be sure that, when it comes time to do it, we are really ready to do it.;N
And I think we are going to have to look at that and be sure that is implemented in the right way.;N
And then have you had a chance to talk yet today about your views generally on the next highway bill?;N
I mean, that is one of the things we were able to get done in the last 2 years, but we only got it done for 2 years, so that is coming up pretty quickly.;N
I believe the normal request for reauthorization that would have come from the Secretary of Transportation did not come because Mr. LaHood is leaving.;N
And so it is something he didn't have to do but something I would think you would quickly want to get into that discussion and----;N
Well, as we change vehicles, the kinds of vehicles, the mix of vehicles on the road, and as we try to make vehicles more efficient, get more miles out of the gallon of the vehicles that are paying the per-gallon tax, obviously you are working away from your funding stream every time you put more vehicles on the road longer that use less fuel, which obviously we would want to do that, but it doesn't make the formula work like it did.;N
But my response is: Because everybody we work for is totally dependent on everything he is going to be responsible for.;N
I am very excited that U.S. DOT is working right now on the first national multimodal freight strategic plan.;N
You and I had a chance to talk about this, but I want to hear your thoughts or public commitment to whether you will continue the work that Secretary LaHood started in implementing a national freight policy.;N
One of the issues related to that is obviously the level of congestion that affects our ports or affects our roadways in moving U.S. products to their destination.;N
So do you believe that there is a need to establish a dedicated source of funding for nationally and regionally significant freight mobility projects?;N
A very Washington-state-centric issue: Our ferry systems carry annually more than double the amount of people compared to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor.;N
"Our ferries are like many of the national transportation systems; they face congestion or problems.";N
And so I want to make sure that I have your assurances that the ferry system and its funding from the Department of Transportation will receive the support that they deserve as part of our National Highway System.;N
One of the priorities that Chairman Rockefeller, under his leadership, passed was the Aviation Safety Act of 2010, and this was to address the aftermath of the 2009 Colgan Air crash, something that included several rulemakings which have been completed, but there are some that still haven't been.;N
Administrator Huerta told the Committee multiple times that new rules for pilot qualifications for these regional aircrafts will be completed before August 1, 2013.;N
This is something that is very important to many of us on this committee, and wanted to get your support in confirming that the Committee can count on you to ensure that these rules do get implemented or, I should say, published by the August 1 deadline.;N
And one last issue if I could get your thoughts on is the transparency in airline ticket pricing.;N
Last year, airlines collected about $6 billion in baggage and reservation-change fees from passengers, but because of the growing menu of ancillary fees, it has been increasingly difficult for consumers to compare and shop for airfares.;N
And I know that there has been a lot going on both with the department and challenges by the airlines to some of these rules, you know, almost all the way to the Supreme Court.;N
So I know that there are some proposed airline ticket transparency rules now under review by OMB, but I wanted to get your thoughts on the importance of giving consumers better information so that they can make the right pricing decisions.;N
And I want to start by revisiting the conversation you just had a moment ago with Senator Blunt concerning the FAA air traffic controller furloughs and sequestration.;N
And, indeed, given the fiscal and economic challenges we have, we may see even further budgetary cuts at some point in the future.;N
And quite a few of us have been concerned that the administration, in implementing sequestration, has been looking for ways to implement those cuts that are visible and painful and exacerbate the pain of the cuts.;N
And, indeed, quite a few of us, I think, believed that the air traffic controller furloughs was an example of that.;N
Can we have a commitment from you that, in implementing sequestration and in implementing whatever further budget cuts may occur down the road, that you will employ your very best efforts to target waste, fraud, and abuse, to target redundancy, to target ways to trim the fat and tighten the belt, while minimizing the pain and inconvenience to customers, to the American people, while minimizing unnecessary inconvenience to consumers?;N
And so it is fair to say that you would look for ways to minimize the pain and not to exacerbate it.;N
I would like to shift to another topic that you and I, I think, had a very productive conversation on, and that concerned regulation and the impact of government regulation retarding economic growth, killing jobs, and the need for regulatory reform, which is a principle that the president has publicly espoused.;N
I would note that just recently the Congressional Research Service released a report that indicates that during the first 4 years of President Obama's administration that the administration issued more than 13,000 final rules, which was substantially more than its predecessor.;N
And, indeed, there were 330 major rules, rules that have economic impact of $100 million or greater.;N
And that represented a 24 percent increase from the second term of the Bush administration.;N
And given the concerns you raised about working to minimize the harm of regulations, would you agree in your first 100 days as secretary, if you are confirmed, to work to identify at least three regulations within your purview that, in your judgment, are unduly burdensome and to work with me to ameliorate that burden?;N
And if I may ask the Chairman's indulgence to ask one additional question, although my time has expired.;N
And the final question I wanted to ask is, there is a provision in MAP-21 that allows states to assume responsibilities for environmental studies and clearances.;N
And one of the significant impediments to building new transportation projects can be those clearances.;N
California has already been able to realize a 25 percent cost and time savings as a result of the NEPA delegation.;N
And Texas will now have to petition the Department to be granted authority for NEPA delegation.;N
And if you are confirmed, I wanted to ask your approach to how you will approach that petition that will be forthcoming.;N
Mr. Chairman, if I could just add to what you have said--and I do have another question or two, but I can put those on the record, because I know you are going to be responding to some questions on the record.;N
But I think one observation I would make with regard to where we are, the one thing we can't do--and this is why I asked the question about the next highway bill and what you saw your role as being--we cannot continue to borrow from the general fund to fund highways.;N
We either have to decide that we are going to pay for it and figure out how we are going to do it or we are going to have to have a lot smaller appetite when it comes to infrastructure.;N
The one outcome that is not acceptable to me is to continue to borrow and to transfer from the general fund and basically put that on the backs of our children and grandchildren.;N
My frustration is that, when the DOT secretaries come in front of the Committee and we have asked for specific suggestions about how to do that, you know, we usually get the answer, ``We will work with you, with Congress,'' and we understand that.;N
But I also hope that you will lead, that the President will lead, and come up and put specific ideas on the table about how to solve these problems.;N
It is important to our country, it is important to our competitiveness, it is important to our economy.;N
And so everything that we do, we ought to have a focus on, what will this do to grow the economy, to create jobs, and to improve the take-home pay of middle-class Americans?;N
And I think a robust, strong infrastructure that supports that economy is critical and vital to that, but it has to be paid for.;N
And so I hope that you will get your pencils out and find as many savings as you can within the department's budget and look at doing things more efficiently, but then when it comes to putting proposals forward, with regard, for example, to the next highway bill, to be specific and, you know, come at us with your ideas.;N
I want to get you on the record on this, because I mentioned in our meeting that Senator McCaskill and I were successful last year in enacting the European Trading Scheme Prohibition Act.;N
And I just want to know if you are prepared to exercise your authority granted in the law to protect U.S. aviation users from the ill effects of the EU ETS if that is necessary.;N
And do you believe that ICAO is the place, which operates through international consensus, is the proper venue and manner to address international aviation emissions reductions?;N
We may be facing that issue here again in the not-too-distant future, so I look forward to working with you on that.;N
We are going to consider the nomination of Dr. Mark E. Schaefer of California to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere at the U.S. Department of Commerce.;N
We look forward to your testimony, Doctor, and I want to accommodate the Senator from the great state of Hawaii, who needs to excuse himself because he has got to fly to Hawaii.;N
Dr. Schaefer, thank you for taking the time to testify before this committee and for visiting with my office individually.;N
I am impressed by your qualifications and your track record of resolving issues with open and candid dialogue.;D
The budgetary process and pressures from the sequester will make your problem-solving through dialogue approach all the more important.;N
But when funding is short, we cannot afford the expenses and inefficiency of lawsuits to manage critical ocean and coastal resources.;N
And I do look forward to working with the issues that I will mention to you on the record, as well as anything that may come up in Hawaii and the Pacific.;N
First, the statutory time limit of December 7, 2013 for NOAA's listing decision on 66 species of Pacific corals is rapidly approaching.;N
Academic experts at the University of Hawaii have questioned NOAA's scientific basis for such a listing, but to the best of my knowledge, NOAA has not yet worked with the university experts to address their concerns.;N
Could you please describe your approach going forward and how you are going to use the University of Hawaii's expertise on this important matter?;N
My question is about the bigeye tuna issue, if you will just give me a moment to pull up the question.;N
The Western Pacific Fisheries Management Commission has, under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, established an annual quota on bigeye tuna for Hawaii's longline fleet.;N
If confirmed, do I have your commitment to work with us to constructively support the well-managed Western Pacific longline fishery?;N
And to the extent that it is both profitable and sustainable, it ought to be a model for the rest of the world.;N
And we are going to have to make some adjustments on the fly to make sure that they remain economically viable as they have demonstrated that they are being managed sustainably.;N
I just left the Joint Economic Committee talking about infrastructure, and I got over here as soon as I could.;N
So I am appreciative that Senator Schatz was here to ask questions, and I am glad that we did not adjourn the hearing before I could get here.;N
I want to thank you, Senator Nelson, for chairing this hearing on the nomination of Dr. Schaefer to be Assistant Secretary for--of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere.;N
It is important for the Committee to review the nominations for NOAA leadership promptly in order for this Agency to be managed appropriately.;N
It may come to--as a surprise to some of our viewers today that NOAA is the largest agency within the Department of Commerce, and has a mission of science, service, and stewardship.;N
The Agency is responsible for conducting research and gathering data to help us understand our oceans and atmosphere, as well as manage our resources.;N
The responsibilities of NOAA include daily weather forecasts, fisheries management, coastal restoration, and support for marine commerce.;N
NOAA is organized into six line offices and requires strong leadership to ensure that these line offices of working together and serving the needs of our country.;N
NOAA has a vital presence throughout our Nation, including in my home state of Mississippi.;N
NOAA facilities in Mississippi include the National Data Buoy Center, the Northern Gulf Institute, the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology, and the National Coastal Data Development Center.;N
The work performed at these centers and institutes is important for understanding our oceans and coasts and protecting our resources for our citizens.;N
Today, NOAA faces many challenges, including a tough fiscal environment, needed improvements in fisheries management, and the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon disaster.;N
Large cuts have already been made at the National Data Buoy Center, which is crucial for environmental monitoring.;N
This year, two lawsuits were filed against the National Marine Fisheries Services regarding the Federal management of red snapper, and I will ask the witness about that in just a moment.;N
It is also tasked with important responsibilities for Gulf restoration under the RESTORE Act.;N
I look forward to hearing Dr. Schaefer's perspectives on how NOAA can face these challenges.;D
Tell us what--enlighten the Committee, if you will, about the red snapper lawsuits, and how do you feel about fisheries management approaches that require coordination between the states and Federal Government?;N
Do you think the discrepancy in the estimates is a result of different methodologies used by various scientists?;N
How do you plan to work with other agencies and academic institutions to deal with complex problems, such as the dead zone?;N
Senator, my heart goes out to you, and to Senator Landrieu, and Senator Vitter, for the dead zone is the size of Delaware, off your states.;N
Now, we have enough trouble in Florida with dead zones of polluted water being dumped out of Lake Okeechobee, which it has to because the lake gets too high, and it threatens the earthen dam because of the pressure.;N
But what it does is it creates a dead zone to the east in the St. Lucia River and to the west in the Caloosahatchee River.;N
And the same thing is happening now because the water has gotten up to 15 feet high, and the Corps of Engineers is going to have to start dumping water out of there to avert a disaster of it breaking the dam and flooding all of these agricultural and populated areas.;N
And I just cannot imagine a dead zone the size of the state of Delaware off your and Louisiana state.;N
And it is being done through an Everglades Restoration Project, which we have it going on pretty good.;N
And we will certainly look to you and others for assistance in this regard, as well as looking to NOAA for the facts and the science.;N
Now, with regard to your questions on the fisheries, thanks to your help, you were a co-sponsor of the RESTORE Act.;N
Once the judge makes his decision on what the fine is going to be, that money is going to flow pursuant to the law that we pass called the RESTORE Act.;N
And two and a half percent of that total is going to go to try to address exactly the question that you answered--that you asked, which was, what is the fish population out there?;N
And making those assessments through the National Marine Fisheries Service, helped by the commission that was set up by the RESTORE Act, in order to have up to date data on what the fish population is so that we do not go through what we have been going through, where decisions are made to cut off a fishery with outdated data, data that is six and seven years old.;N
So, Dr. Schaefer, tell us what you think about it since you are going to be working directly with the National Marine Fisheries Service about utilizing that two and a half percent of the RESTORE Act.;N
Now, Senator Rubio and I are going to have a hearing in a couple of weeks down in famous Apalachicola Bay, which used to be known and has been known over the centuries as some of the finest oysters.;N
It is being threatened by a number of things, not the least of which the lack of fresh water coming down the river that starts the Chattahoochee River up north of Atlanta.;N
And this fishery collapsed last year, long-term drought plus the lack of the fresh water coming down the river, illegal harvesting.;N
Now, it is my understanding that NOAA needs information to document a fishery failure before it can declare an emergency.;N
So do you have information on this that you can update us on the status of this declaration?;N
Well, we are going to help you along by virtue of the hearing that we will have coming up in the early part of August down there.;N
And I think as I walked in, I heard the chairman talking about how do we determine how much fish or other types of aquatic life we have in an area.;N
And this is an issue that I am very concerned about in the Gulf of Maine, that we have had a situation, particularly with the cod and had a stock in the Gulf of Maine, that as a result of actions taken by NOAA--in fact, yesterday I was questioning Administrator Bullard about this issue, that our fishermen have gone through this year a 78 percent cut in what they can fish for in their quota for the Gulf of Maine--in the Gulf of Maine for cod.;N
And one of the issues that was touched upon in the hearing yesterday is that the need for--in fact, the head of the New England Fishery Management Council reiterated this.;N
The need for better data and research to be able to know exactly, you know, what stocks exist, and to put us in a position where, you know, these people who are small fishermen and women who have been put out of business, many of them have done this for generations.;N
And so it is an issue that I am very concerned about because there is a lot of feeling that the science behind it is that we have not adequately developed it to really understand where things are.;N
And so, I wanted to get your thoughts on that because it seems to me that we need to do better research so that we can strike the right balance so that, you know, people who have made their livelihood, I think, responsibly off the seas for years, trying to do the right thing, can continue to do that, while we make sure that we have obviously adequate stocks.;N
Anyone who is running any kind of business, if they saw a 78 percent reduction--I mean, it is hard to see how they would survive, and particularly those who have made their way on the seas for years and generations.;N
That is very important to all of us in New England, and that you would give a commitment to that issue to make sure that what we are doing in research is adequate, and if we need to obviously put a greater emphasis on it, if you communicate that with the Committee, I certainly look forward to working with you on that.;N
I recently on Monday had a meeting with a lot of my guys in the fisheries business, and my question really is very similar to Senator Ayotte's question.;N
I would love for you to come down to South Carolina and take a look off the coast so you can have an appreciation for the reality that we, at least at home, believe that we need more sound science to show the reality of the oceans.;N
And we would love for you to come down and participate in an offshore discovery opportunity.;N
I will say that one of the questions I thought was important that my fishermen were asking had to do with the fact that their livelihood is not a today-only livelihood.;N
There are actually multiple generations in the business, and they have started restaurants and succeeded.;N
One specific company, Crosby Seafood, spent a lot of time just helping me understand what it takes for them to help create the wonderful tourism that we have on the coast.;N
We bring about $30 million tourism in from Myrtle Beach through Charleston and Hilton Head.;N
Charleston has been fortunate to be the number one tourist destination in the world, according to Conde Nast magazine.;N
There is a company--a restaurant, Husk, number one new restaurant in 2011 in all of America.;N
They set their menus at midnight, and I am not sure if I have this exactly as they said it, but this is basically how it happens.;N
They get a text from the satellite that tells them what is going to be available, and then they set their menu for the next day because every day they try to change their menu.;N
And there are certain things that you cannot get during season, so in March and April, it is very difficult to get any red snapper because of the limits.;N
So my question is, as we have driven our economy in South Carolina, especially on the coast of South Carolina, with tourism because of our restaurant business, which is then driven by what is found in the oceans, it would be very important for us to have an opportunity for you to come down and help us understand the process that you would take to uncover what NOAA really needs to do in order to understand what is happening off of the coast of South Carolina.;N
On James Island, I have been there a couple of times, and it really is a great resource for us.;N
The second question I have for you, and it is really more of a comment than it is a question.;N
The President's Executive Order implementing a new national ocean policy gives NOAA responsibility for over 130 items without any specificity with respect to new regulations, or new regulatory actions, or legal authority that has been spelled out.;N
And so, my real question is, one of the concerns that we have is that with that large footprint, without any clarity that would be provided by legislation, we find ourselves in a position where it seems like the Federal reach would go beyond where it has been.;N
I would love to have your comment on how to go about building a policy that creates clarity, and ensuring that the bureaucracy does not start creating legislation essentially by rulemakings.;N
We hope to have the opportunity, if you are confirmed, to work with you on what we would define as a Federal overreach, and define some limits on how to gather the information in such a way that it makes it all work together and creates connectivity without the Federal Government becoming in charge of what we believe is important to remain in the hands of states and local jurisdictions.;N
I want to remind the colleagues that--and NOAA that we have agreed on an expedited process for questions for the record.;N
So for the Committee members, please have your questions submitted by the close of business tomorrow, July 25.;N
And, Dr. Schaefer, the Committee asks that your response to these questions be submitted by 10:00 Monday morning.;N
We hope to vote on your nomination at the Committee's Executive Session on Tuesday, July 30.;N
And so, if we can expedite this process, it will enable us to go ahead and vote on your nomination.;N
Chairman Rockefeller and Senator Thune, thank you, as well as other members of the Committee, for allowing Senator Kirk and I to come here today to introduce the nominee that the President has offered to this committee and to Congress for the important position of Secretary of Commerce.;N
I know that you are leaning in our direction, Mr. Chairman, because of your wonderful Illinois-born wife and your connections to our great State.;N
Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to introduce Penny Pritzker, the President's nominee to be Secretary of Commerce.;N
She is here with her family, whom she will introduce, I am sure, when the time is right for that.;N
What you see when you consider Ms. Pritzker is not only decades of business, entrepreneurial, and civic experience, which make her a strong candidate for this position, but also a warm, compassionate person who has really given back to the committee in Illinois and across the Nation.;D
Ms. Pritzker has built five businesses from scratch, served on numerous corporate boards, and has been an effective leader of major corporations.;D
She ranks as one of the most influential women in corporate America, and that is quite an achievement when you consider the glass ceilings and other obstacles which women face.;D
Her lifetime of business experience includes her current role as Founder, Chairman, and CEO of PSP Capital Partners and Pritzker Realty Group.;D
She also serves on the Board of Artemus Real Estate Partners and Hyatt Hotels Corporation, previously served on the boards of William Rigley, Jr. Company, Marmon Group, and the LaSalle Bank Corporation.;D
Her decades of business experience will serve her well in leading this Agency's primary mission, which is to work with businesses, universities, and communities to promote job creation and economic growth.;D
Let me just point out a few things that Senator Durbin mentioned, that she started a new business from the ground up called Classic Residence by Hyatt that already employs 3,500 Americans.;D
I have a letter for you that I would like to submit for the record by President Reagan's former Chairman of the FDIC, William Isaac, that I think will help you.;N
Senator Kirk.--I will be whipping each one of you on behalf of Penny's nomination coming up when the vote comes, hoping that this voice for business becomes our next Commerce Secretary.;N
And then what we are going to do is what we did yesterday, and that is that other colleagues on both sides will not give opening remarks, but all questioning periods will go for 7 minutes so you can kind of do quite a lot with that, all right?;N
We are meeting today to consider a distinguished nominee to be the next Secretary of Commerce.;N
We have not had a Secretary of Commerce in a while, and if I can be just a bit rash, we have not had a strong Secretary of Commerce in quite a while.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing today on the nomination of Penny Pritzker to be the next Secretary of Commerce.;D
Ms. Pritzker, the justifiable public outrage over the actions taken by the IRS against conservative organizations underscores how critical it is for government leaders to scrupulously honor the public trust.;D
My question is, what, if anything, can you pledge this committee regarding your commitment to safeguard the trust that would be bestowed upon you as a Cabinet Secretary?;N
We have all watched this week with what happened in Moore, Oklahoma, and our hearts and prayers go out to the people who were struck by that deadly and devastating tornado this week.;N
At the same time, we can be grateful that the warnings and alerts issued by the Commerce Department's National Weather Service helped to save lives.;N
As you learn firsthand, if confirmed--you will learn, I should say--every department and agency is making tough choices in the face of necessary budget cuts.;N
Can we have your commitment that if confirmed, you will ensure that budget cuts are made in ways that prioritize funding for the Department's public safety missions, like the delivery of timely warnings about severe weather?;N
And can you pledge to us as well that you will work with this committee to find efficiencies and ways to stretch taxpayer dollars further when it comes to the various responsibilities of the Commerce Department?;N
As I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, some have criticized the Administration as being anti-;N
In 2010, the Chairman of the Business Roundtable and COO of Verizon famously said the Administration was fostering this, and this is, I quote, ``an increasingly hostile environment for investment and job creation.'';N
If confirmed, you would bring a track record of entrepreneurial activity in the private sector as well as service on the President's Jobs Council to the position of Secretary.;D
And maybe as a follow up to that, can you provide some examples of actions that you have taken or strategies that you have used successfully to create jobs in the private sector?;N
But with regard to the failure of Superior Bank in 2001, it was a bank that was one of the early leaders in subprime lending.;N
Some of your defenders have stated that you had no active role in management of the bank for 7 years prior to the bank's failure.;N
But according to a report issued by the FDIC's inspector general, concerns were raised by the Office of Thrift Supervision about the bank's mortgage banking practices as early as 1993 when you were still Chair of the bank's board.;D
In addition, others have pointed out that you continued to serve as a board member for Superior Bank's holding company and sat on the bank's audit company--or audit committee until its failure.;D
Could you just tell us what role you played at the bank in the years leading up to Superior Bank's failure in 2001?;N
So ultimately there were a number of the bank's uninsured depositors that had claims that they lost over $100,000 worth of savings, including one who reportedly deposited her entire retirement account with Superior a month before it failed.;N
What do you have to say to those depositors who lost significant sums of money because of this venture, and what lessons did you learn from your experience at Superior Bank that will inform your role as Secretary of Commerce, if you are confirmed?;D
My hope is that this committee will recommend you and that you will be able to serve, I think, as someone who--a deep background in business.;D
This is a voice that will be needed in the Administration and will help us again--help this economy recover, and focus again on greater job creation.;N
at the Department, but down a bit, is the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, and part of that was spectrum management.;N
The President has laid out a very ambitious goal to try to get 500 megahertz spectrum available over the next 10 years.;N
I would like for you to speak a little bit about how we can make sure that we keep that on track.;N
And one of our challenges is to make sure that our Federal entities are a little more responsive in terms of spectrum sharing and trying to make sure that we take full opportunity and get full economy-wide value of this public asset.;N
Well, I might just add, I know there is some spectrum in that 1755 to 1780 megahertz range, that 25 megahertz of spectrum that we could move quicker on.;N
We are just starting to get into the weeds already, but there have been some that say let us take a bigger block.;N
Another area that you are going to have at least oversight over is the Patent and Trade Office.;N
I think we are all concerned that entrepreneurs are victims more and more often of patent trolls.;N
I think we have seen unfortunately in my old industries massive allocations of capital to basically build patent arsenals that could be better utilized in terms of innovative and breakthrough technology rather than simply building up arsenals to--in what could be, frankly, litigation wars.;N
I do not know if you might want to have some general comments about what we can do to try to make sure that we get better ideas into the marketplace and try to decrease the--what I think is the dramatic increase of patent litigation, much of it not geared at real innovation protection, but really just about trying to sometimes transfer wealth between large entities.;N
I personally believe that we ought to give the President's--this President and future presidents the ability that any Governor has had to do executive reorganization.;N
I will not open that can of worms at this hearing today, but my hope would be is that you will come in with a fresh look--an entrepreneur's and business person's look--at the wide variety of programs within the Commerce Department, look at where there can be streamlining, look where there can be consolidation, look where we can better bang for the buck.;N
And I might just, you know, again, editorialize and highlight one area that we have worked on and we had an opportunity to have a brief conversation about.;N
I have been trying to get this Administration for years to actually look at how we might support State and local economic development efforts at a Federal level to bring jobs back into America for a whole host of reasons, jobs that had been outsourced over the past few years.;N
Companies are looking at bringing manufacturing and other production jobs back to this country particularly in rural areas.;N
My hope is you will, one, as my time ticks down, look at streamlining all programmatic areas within the Commerce Department, and, two, work with me and other members--this is some bipartisan legislation I have actually got with Congressman Frank Wolf in the House, at how we can do a better job at the Federal level to support insourcing of jobs back into this country.;N
I should warn my colleagues that the floor is not behaving properly, and they are talking about a 12 vote.;N
But what I would suggest is on my side of the dais here, that we cut our 7 minutes down to 5 minutes, and the other side of the aisle will have 7 minutes.;N
And when we had the pleasure of meeting and having a good conversation, I also brought up about looking at streamlining the Department, looking for efficiencies, and asked if you had any examples at that time.;N
Have you thought of any specific examples or maybe in different program areas where you would look to find some efficiencies?;N
Also we have a manufacturing sector here in this country that has faced challenges for many, many years.;N
If we are going to ensure that our manufacturing sector is competitive, I think we have to look at regulations.;N
Would you commit to looking at those regulatory policies, and I believe especially the trade policies that we have in this country, so that we can ensure that we have a more level playing field?;N
I happen to believe that trade is vital for not just manufacturing, for ag products as well.;N
And I see that as a definite area for growth and job creation, so I appreciate your focus on that.;N
Senator Warner was asking you about spectrum, and as you know from our discussion, that is an important issue, I believe, for the country, that we have to look at add spectrum.;N
There has been some discussion on how accurate the cost estimates have been with regards to spectrum.;N
I believe the Department of Defense in the past has estimated that it would cost $4.6 billion to clear that 1755 to the 1850 band.;N
You are, Senator Fischer, especially to Senator Blunt, because if he leaves, this is going to be a disaster.;N
We are always prepared to work in a bipartisan fashion in reducing the time, at least in questioning Ms. Pritzker.;N
I enjoyed our conversation just in the last couple of days, and we hit on a couple of topics that I thought were very important to the future of America, one being trade.;N
And we had a robust conversation about China, which I think is important to consider, from currency issues to enforcing parts of our free trade agreements that have already been passed.;N
I believe that South Carolina's manufacturing base is a part of the solution for our future.;N
If we as Americans do not continue to make things that are tangible, we have a very long road ahead of us.;N
So Mr. Warner and I will be working on the Subcommittee of Competiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion.;N
I hope that we will have many opportunities to work with you as well if you are confirmed.;N
And then we have the second highest tire concentration with companies like Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental coming to our state as well and expanding.;N
And as we consider the topic of insourcing, having jobs come back to America, we can look no further than UTC and Otis Elevators, that now have a presence in Florence, South Carolina, with 400 jobs that have been insourced back.;N
My question to you is, I would like to hear from you your thoughts on how we can further promote U.S. industry and encourage more foreign investment to come to places throughout the country, and of course, specifically, South Carolina.;D
The second question really helps us bridge the gap and create more opportunities as it relates to our ability to track more investment to our country.;N
We certainly see that the enforcement of our trade laws is one of the common challenges that we face from things like transshipment of U.S. goods to Iran, to protection of our pharmaceutical companies' intellectual property, to proper classification of imported goods.;N
As Secretary of Commerce, if you are confirmed, how would you prioritize the enforcement of our trade laws?;N
One of the things that we have done well in South Carolina is the notion of synergy of our economic assets, realizing that having one of America's greatest ports in Charleston gives us an opportunity to attract that industry, like the BMWs and the Boeings.;N
The infrastructure needs plus the transportation needs, whether it is transit or the Port of Charleston or other ports.;N
With the Panamax ships coming through the Panama Canal starting in 2015, 2016, will provide a real opportunity, a robust opportunity, for us to move forward on meeting our expectations of doubling our exports over the next few years.;N
I would not have thought I had gotten this done before I had to leave, but I am glad to get a chance to, one, welcome you to the Committee, and, two, welcome what you potentially bring to the Commerce Department.;N
I actually think the Acting Secretary has done an admirable job under difficult circumstances, and I think that this important Department needs somebody who is confirmed, and in charge, and ready to take hold.;N
On transshipment, which Senator Scott mentioned, you know, actually it is an issue I have been pretty involved in because we have had several companies that get the ruling they need, the Chinese or someone else.;N
Most of these cases I am thinking of is the Chinese were not in compliance with trade laws.;N
They get a sanction against them, and then somehow these same products just keep--start coming from somewhere else in a different box.;N
The Commerce Department has, as a matter of stated policy, said that it will not address evasion of duties through transshipment.;N
So we have got a bipartisan bill that was introduced in the last Congress, the Enforce Act.;N
I hope that you will look into this and find out why that would be the stated policy of the Commerce Department.;N
Maybe they just think they have got too many things to keep track of, but this is a problem that many members of the Senate want to work with you to help solve.;N
Could you talk a little bit about the energy potential in the country today and how that may--might have an impact on manufacturing?;N
And as we mentioned the other day when we were visiting, I think that there is no more logical advocate for good cost-based energy policies than the Secretary of Commerce.;N
And I am glad that you are headed in that direction and you are thinking as well--trade tax, the rule of law.;N
Another thing I might mention as I try to not take advantage of my--is travel, something you know a lot about.;N
When I was still in the House, we creates something that is now called Brand USA, and I think it has great potential, but clearly needs somebody in the Department paying attention to be sure that everything they do is justified.;N
Again, you probably know more about that than anybody in this room, and your sense of how important travel is to the economy, and particularly foreign travel, if you want to say anything about that.;N
They spend more, and when they leave, they almost always like us a whole lot better than they did when they came.;N
And again, in this job, you understand all of the impact of this throughout the economy, and look forward to working with you on that, assuming you are confirmed.;N
And Senator Blunt and I have worked together extensively on tourism, and I appreciate your knowledge.;D
I thought you answered that well, so I am not going to go over that again, but I appreciate that.;N
I think you know this is a huge opportunity for our country to gain jobs, tens of thousands of jobs for every point that we gain back of the international tourism market.;N
When you and I talked, I spoke about the ability of the Commerce Secretary, particularly someone with your background, to really being an advocate for business as a whole, not just the things under your Agency, but that I see this need that we have right now for someone to look at, I had suggested to you, our top 15, 20 exporting industries, and figure out while they all have some things in common, they also each have individual things that can help: tourism, the visa wait times, a medical device.;D
You literally can go through the list and find unique things, and I wondered if you could comment on that, the bigger role the Commerce Secretary could play and that you could envision yourself playing.;N
You mentioned exports, and I think that the--part of this is, of course, the Foreign Commercial Service, and I just hope you will be committed to continuing that.;N
We would love to see it expanded every time we get some new business for one of our small-and medium-sized businesses that cannot afford to have their own trade expert on Morocco, but can do a lot of business there.;N
I think we have a good thing going, and it is really one of the best things we can invest in.;N
So I hope you will continue to expand that to help those small and medium-sized businesses.;D
Some of my colleagues asked you about manufacturing, and I just had a hearing on the Joint Economic Committee on women in manufacturing, and we had three women in business as witnesses.;N
And as the recent book Lean In has pointed out, there is a lot of room for women to grow in business.;N
Across manufacturing, women only hold 17 percent of the board seats, are only 12 percent of the executive officers, and are just 6 percent of CEOs.;N
And then you go on the front line workers, the share of women workers in the manufacturing industry has been declining actually, even though we are seeing an upsurge in hiring right now since 1990 and is now 27 percent at its lowest level since 1971.;N
One is, as you know, we have job openings right now in manufacturing in states like mine that have a 5.4 percent unemployment rate.;N
And the manufacturers are trying to get women to go into this with the argument, this is no longer your grandpa's manufacturing floor anymore.;N
You are someone that has been successful in business, but how we get more women into the boardroom and running companies.;N
The Commerce Department and the Economic Statistics Administration, as you know, provide critical up-to-date information about the social and economic needs of communities.;N
And that all sounds like a bunch of gobbledygook, but most people are not aware that business leaders heavily rely on this for demographic and socioeconomic data so they can do business.;N
And I just want to get your commitment because I know these kind of surveys can be under attack at times, but your understanding that they go to very good use to help the American economy and people in business.;N
And thank you for the commitment earlier with Senator Warner to continue the strong Patent Office.;N
We have one company, 3M, that literally has so many patents, they have a patent for every employee.;N
And so it is very important for our State, and we want to continue that in a strong way, as well as look at some of the patent troll issues with litigation.;N
Congratulations on your nomination, and thank you and your family for your willingness to serve.;N
Obviously I and several in the Committee as a whole, I think, are confident that the breadth and depth of your experience in, both the private and the public sector, will be a tremendous added bonus to the Commerce Department at this important time in our Nation's history.;D
You will be taking over the Department at a critical time for our economy, and I hope that as Secretary you will use all your experiences to create jobs and expand economic opportunity in the Nation.;D
You know, from our conversation the other day and your impressive resume, I know that you are well prepared to lead the Department, which is encouraging.;D
And it is important to us in Massachusetts because we have some challenges right now, one of which you and I spent an extensive amount talking about.;N
And it will surprise no one on this committee that I now wish to engage you on the issue of the fishing industry.;N
As you know, the fishing industry in Massachusetts is 300 years strong, and it is not just the boats and the men and women who serve on those, but the seaside businesses that are important to us, but are also struggling because of changes in the fishing economy.;N
Right now, fishermen in the northeast are living under a 77 percent cut in the number of fish they can catch, and the situation imperils the very existence of the industry.;N
And as I mentioned to you, there are some challenges, some of which are manmade, and that the fishing industry in my neck of the woods believe that they have not had a good partner in the Commerce Department, and NOAA in particular, in recent years.;N
And I talked to you about the need for Commerce and NOAA to have a much more comprehensive and thoughtful and inclusive plan with our fishing industry to help save this industry and bridge a gap toward its--a brighter future.;N
And so I want to ask at this time if you are willing to make a commitment to work with those of us who represent the great and proud fishing industry in the northeast to plan for a brighter future and to address the realities that we are facing right now, and help us find a way forward collaboratively, because we believe that has been missing.;N
And I, of course, would invite you to come up to Gloucester, New Bedford, any of our ports at any time to meet with our fishing community and the municipal leaders who are so supportive of that industry.;N
If I could just go back to a topic that has been raised by the chairman and a few issues, the issue of cybersecurity.;N
As a business leader yourself, and you mentioned the cyber hits that your current business has received in the billions.;D
One of the issues as we grapple with this in Congress is what is the best way to move forward constructively, particularly around the issue of information sharing between the private and the public sector?;N
And I am wondering what is your viewpoint on that particular issue, both as a business owner and as someone who is going to be charged with leading the Commerce Department?;N
And I would encourage you, again, during your visit to Massachusetts, you might want to visit with some of our elite higher ed institutions, including your alma mater and the folks over at MIT and at Northeastern, where you are going to find a wealth of experts in the area of cybersecurity.;N
I am sure they would be willing to work with you and the Department to help us find a way forward.;N
And with that, I am going to yield the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman, but thank Ms. Pritzker for her willingness to serve.;N
Senator Cowan, some of us are feeling a little hurt because you have declined to invite any of your colleagues to go up and look at your fishing.;N
Chairman, I am penning handwritten notes even as I speak to each of you inviting you to the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts.;N
Having been in business myself, I can tell you there are many pluses that come to bringing private sector experience to the public sector realm, but also you have to face the challenges and be accountable for some of the things that happened in the private sector, and people bring up all sorts of things.;N
So my first question is, you know, our state AFL-CIO and many others have a boycott of the Alaska National Hyatt.;N
And one of the issues is that they are concerned about minimum wage jobs or the subcontracting of minimum wage jobs as a way to just keep the workforce at a lower rate.;N
So, one of the things you are going to face as Secretary is how to maintain and get high wage jobs into our economy.;N
So, do you want to comment on the former, or how we do the latter, and look forward to---- ;N
So this is a--the notion of subcontracting out to keep minimum wage jobs as a way to maintain a workforce is not something you support.;N
Well, one issue that I would love to see you take a leadership role on within the Department, and one that you and I had a chance to talk about, and one in which I think you could bring a huge private sector focus to that would be very, very helpful is this issue that the chairman brought up in his opening statement about a weather-ready Nation.;D
To think that literally NOAA was getting Weather Service information from Europe because they were further ahead--I think it was 4 days ahead of predicting what Sandy was going to be, than NOAA was capable of.;N
That is because they have instituted new technology and used an ensemble model, which basically analyzes the storm and information data in a new way, and then presents it.;N
What do you think you can do to help bring us to a better weather-ready Nation and institute new technology?;N
I know that we just passed a Sandy bill, and there will be more supercomputing time, but this is an issue where we have to keep competitive.;N
I mean, the difference between knowing 15 minutes ahead of time and an hour ahead of time is a huge difference.;N
Part of the issue is that they have great satellite technology information, but it is often secure.;N
So what I guess I am looking for is your leadership ability coming in and bringing agencies together as well, and figuring out how to get the best information into public officials' hands so that we can do a better job of helping people prepare, because the technology is there to know the power of these storms.;D
And the late Ron Brown once said that he was Secretary of Commerce, but if a member of Congress was calling him, he guaranteed it was about fish.;N
And I have the same concern and want to know what your thoughts are on the Bristol Bay pebble mine, which is a mine that is in Alaska that has--basically it is at the head of one of the largest sockeye fisheries and the largest Chinook fisheries, which is basically the head waters for Puget Sound salmon.;N
So we want to make sure that you are going to be very adamant about good science leading the way to protecting against undue development that might impact those fisheries.;N
Well, I guess what I am interested in is whether you will have good science help engaged in the process.;N
Again, appreciate your willingness to be subjected to all these process to be a public servant, so I know that takes some time.;D
Let me--we talked about several issues, and I actually want to follow up on fish because, as you know, Alaska produces the wild cod American fish product, about 60 percent, 50-something percent of the fish.;N
As the Chair of the Committee that deals with it here, you know, we are going to be going through the Magnuson-Stevens rewrite, so it is obviously something we will be engaged with you on.;N
But let me ask you, you know, we are going to lose, or you are going to lose, some of your appointed--the National Marine Fisheries Services, Eric Schwab, who is now stepping down.;N
And there has been a lot of issues to make sure we have good, strong leadership there, obviously also in NOAA.;N
I guess I want a commitment that you will make this a priority as quickly as possible because of the work that we have to do on the Magnuson-Stevens reauthorization bill and the fisheries issues that are in front of us right now.;N
Let me also--we talked a little about satellites, one that you are learning quite a bit about.;N
And there is a group of independent review from the aerospace executives that call the program somewhat dysfunctional.;N
It makes a difference on our weather forecasts and when we do them so we do not have to depend on other people.;N
Will you commit to make sure that you will spend the appropriate time to dive into how to make the system better than it is today?;N
Lots of it is around allocations or getting the resources for them, and helping us understand what we should be doing to help make that better.;N
Actually in the President's Fiscal Year 2014 budget, he eliminates another 103 positions in the forecast offices, about now an 80 percent reduction.;N
You know running a business that when you start doing overtime, there are a lot of costs--fatigue and other costs--;N
Can I get a commitment from you that you will reexamine the decision of the hiring freeze and how they are handling furloughs in the Weather Service?;N
It is going to have a negative impact on the outcome, the product that we need for situations like in Oklahoma or Sandy and otherwise.;N
This is one, and we talked about this, on the Arctic oil and gas issues and the EIS, the environmental impact statement, that NOAA has their supplemental draft out right now.;N
The definition, when you look at it, it defines it almost as if the drilling program is to limit each company to only one drill well at a time in the theater, meaning two areas of theater, one rig, one well total.;N
Basically by that action, you could economically determine the outcome, which is nothing will happen.;N
But will give some assurances, at least here, that you will work to ensure that the people who have leases up there can fully utilize those leases under the conditions we set obviously and the environmental conditions and everything else, but not be--and this is my phrase.;N
It is not, I think, what NOAA was doing, but back dooring it by collapsing their ability to move forward by saying, well, sorry, you can only do one, that is it.;N
Well, we need them to look at that whole air shed at one time, not just single applications that are coming in.;N
Would you commit to look at the broader picture and making sure that we do not something that negatively impacts their ability to move forward on oil and gas exploration of the Arctic?;N
I will leave it at that, and I want to just say that when you start to talk about Pebble Mine, a mine in Alaska, we would encourage you to talk to us also.;N
I am aware that for a lot of good reasons, a lot of Americans have a very cynical view of the Federal workforce and us.;N
They look at people who work for the Federal Government at large and make assumptions that many times are unfair that there are Federal employees that are bureaucratic bozos, and not working very hard, and making way too much money, and soaking off the taxpayers.;N
And I have got to tell you, I find it very refreshing to find someone who is stepping up like you are in this position.;N
I think you are really coming because you have a desire to serve this country, and your business background is one that I think can serve this country very well.;D
The President has proposed to do away with the Commerce Department and combine the Commerce Department, the Small Business Administration, USTR, and other agencies that have various intersections with business in this country.;N
And I would ask you, do you have some ideas on how your service in this job could help move that goal forward in terms of identifying some strong bipartisan arguments that can made?;N
And one of the problems is we have lots of committees that deal with these various agencies that are not excited about the idea of us trying to avoid some of the duplication and overlap.;N
I am wondering if you have given that any thought and if you see, based on your business background, when sometimes streamlining, and selling, and merging are essential, because you have the discipline of a bottom line.;D
Well, I would look forward to working with you on an ongoing basis, particularly when you find issues of duplication and overlap.;N
I mean, you know, some people on my side of the aisle do not want to confront it, but there is duplication.;N
We have it in agriculture, we have it in Commerce, two programs with ostensibly the same goals, but two different sets of personnel, and rules, and procedures dealing with the pots of money in both places.;N
So I would love to work with you as you identify with an eye towards a business mindset how we could whack away a little bit.;N
The other thing I just want to mention to you is that I have discovered there was an idea a while ago about creating a Federal workforce called Senior Executive Service.;N
And Senior Executive Service was created ostensibly to develop great talent in the Federal Government to compete with the private sector.;N
And the idea is these would be highly qualified employees with a broad background and knowledge, and that they would move around the government basically with a lot of excellence, helping us do a better job performing the services that we must as the government.;N
I think that most of the Senior Executive Service in the Federal Government is not moving much.;N
And it has come to my attention that they have continued to get very, very large bonuses, even in this economic climate.;N
I have put in a piece of legislation to stop the bonuses to Senior Executive Services employees.;N
I think the average bonus was around $16,000, and the salaries for these people range between $119,000 and $180,000 a year.;N
So these are la creeme de la creeme of--even though they only make up, I think, 1 percent of the work force, I think they were getting certainly more than that in terms of bonuses they were receiving.;N
And what I really found troubling about it is that in some agencies, everyone in SES got the bonus.;N
I would ask you to take a look at SES in the Commerce Department, and particularly the legislation I have introduced would prohibit those bonuses from being given in the environment of sequestration, because most--we have got line employees that are having to take days off without pay, and then we have this little upper crust of Federal employees that are still getting five figure bonuses.;N
So I would love you to take a look at the SESs in the Commerce Department and look at the bonus proposals and procedures, and get back to my office as to what you think--I think GSA has reformed it on their own.;N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Pritzker, for joining us today, for answering these questions.;N
Let me say at the outset that in a bipartisan note, I want to echo the comments that Senator McCaskill just raised about looking at the SES bonuses.;N
I would like to begin by talking about a topic you and I talked about in my office, which was free trade.;N
And in the course of that conversation, as I understood what you said, you said you were an enthusiastic, unapologetic advocate of free trade.;N
As I shared with you, I have been disappointed that in my judgment the current Administration has been less than vigorous in pursuing free trade.;N
And if you are confirmed, I hope that you will be an effective voice for making the Administration far more vigorous going forward.;N
A second area that we talked about that I would like to discuss is the area of regulation.;N
I think that is the most critical element to ensuring our long-term strength and also expanding the opportunity in this country for the least well off among us to climb the economic ladder and to achieve the American Dream.;N
And we talked quite a bit about the impact of overly burdensome regulation and how that can harm businesses, and especially small businesses that are just starting and struggling and that, as you know, generate two-thirds of all new jobs.;N
Yesterday in confirmation hearings with the nominee in this room, the nominee to be Secretary of Transportation, I had a similar conversation with him and asked him at the time if he would commit in his first 100 days to working to identifying at least three regulations that are overly burdensome, and to working with me and with this committee to either modify or repeal those.;N
And indeed his response, which I will confess, I liked very much, is that he suggested that three might not be enough.;N
You also suggested in our conversation the concept of zero-based regulation, that rather than piling one regulation on another, on another, and having them continue to grow vast and unwieldy, that we ought to start from a zero base and ask what regulation is needed and sensible.;N
I very much agree with that notion, and so I would welcome if you would perhaps elaborate on the concept as you shared when we visited.;N
I look forward to working with you on that, and I hope that if you are confirmed that you can provide a voice in this Administration for pulling back the regulations that I think are so damaging to economic growth and in killing jobs, and really impacting in a negative way a great many Americans who are struggling.;N
And as you know, right now, the vast majority of usable spectrum is either owned or shared by the government, 60 to 70 percent.;N
And last year's Spectrum Act statutorily requires the NTIA to ``promote the best possible and most efficient use of electromagnetic spectrum resources across the Federal Government.'';N
In my view, Federal Government ownership of assets, be they spectrum, be they land, or anything else, should be the minimum necessary to protect our critical national interests.;N
And on spectrum, in particular, I would like to see as much of it as possible placed in the private sector hands to allow entrepreneurs and businesses to put it to productive use to generate economic growth and generate jobs.;N
And would you agree to work together to try to assess just how much spectrum the Federal Government needs and now much of that can be sold at significant profit to the government, to the private sector to be put to productive use for private Americans?;N
We are about ready to wrap this up, and the unpleasantness is about over for Ms. Pritzker.;N
But I wanted to ask one other question, and for a minute here I am going to channel Senator Grassley.;N
But some have criticized the fact that you are a beneficiary of some offshore tax avoidance schemes, and that it is hypocritical for the President to nominate Cabinet members who benefited from offshore tax havens when he has criticized that practice for others.;D
One of the areas under your purview is going to be the Administration's enforcement of anti-dumping laws.;D
And the law is intended to prevent domestic industries from being destroyed by imports that are sold here at unfairly low or dumped prices.;N
The Commerce Department determines the precise amount of duties that must be collected to increase the price of dumped imports to a non-injurious level, and estimated $400 to $500 million in anti-dumping duties build on four different types of agricultural imports from China have remained uncollected, and even though their payment is secured by specialized single-;N
entry customs bonds, which are referred to new shipper bonds, that were issued by well-known U.S. insurance companies.;N
The question is, will you commit to provide Congress with a full accounting of all the new shipper bonds that secure anti-;N
dumping duties on these agricultural imports from China and a plan for collecting the unpaid dumping duties secured by these bonds?;N
There are a number of honey producers in South Dakota who would be very happy to hear that answer.;N
There is a lot of transshipped honey from China, and the enforcement mechanisms that are available to prevent that do not get effectively utilized.;N
