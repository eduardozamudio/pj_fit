Our special guest this morning as we have our first hearing or the hearing for the reappointment of Ms. Ness to the Federal Communications Commission.	N
I don't have much of a statement to make prior to the--I will reflect that in my questions, anI woulmove my spotlight to my ranking member on this Committee, Senator Hollings.	N
I include my statement in the recoranyielto our distinguisheSenators who are prepareto introduce the witness.	N
We appreciate your coming this morning anyour interest in this appointment, anI woulask at this time is Mr. Sarbanes ready to introduce his special guest?	N
I'm very pleaseto be here to indicate my very strong support for the reconfirmation of Susan Ness as the Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.	N
During her tenure there, she's chairethe Commission's Federal/State Joint Boarchargewith addressing universal telephone service issues.	D
She's been the Commission's learepresentative for the 1995-1997 WorlRadio Communications Conference.	D
She's currently a member of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners Committee on Communications anthe Federal Communications Bar Association.	D
The Committee knows well that she's been an active proponent of fair competition both domestically anglobally.	D
She's workeharto promote the advancement of new technologies, expaneconomic opportunities, reduce regulatory uncertainty.	D
She's playea key role in shaping policies for the efficient management of the radio spectrum.	D
She's creditewith helping to forge a consensus on the digital television standard, on guidelines to improve the quality anquantity of children's educational television program.	D
She's worketirelessly to facilitate delivery of advancetelecommunications systems to the classroom anto community libraries so that all children can participate in the telecommunications aninformation revolution.	D
She haa very distinguisherecorbefore coming to the Commission, although obviously her performance there is a critical standarin judging her reconfirmation.	D
She has been a senior lender to communication companies as the vice-president of a regional financial institution.	D
She has been a very active leader in our community in Maryland, a Chair of the Montgomery County Charter Review Commission, Vice Chair of the County's Task Force on Community Access to Television.	D
She has done I think a terrific job in handling some very tough problems before the Commission.	D
I think she's reflecteprudence, intelligence, fair anbalancejudgment anI strongly urge the Committee to permit her to carry forwarher goowork by reconfirming her for another term on the FCC.	D
I believe my senior colleague coverea lot of the information that I wish to convey as well anask unanimous consent that my statement go into the record.	N
Mr. Chairman, I, too, wholeheartedly endorse the renomination of Susan Ness to be a Commissioner at the FCC.	N
I think she brings competence, I think she brings experience anI think she brings a sense of community because sometimes we get so fascinateby technology--what are the new regulatory--we forget that really ultimately, telecommunications is to serve the consumer anto help bring the worltogether, either business to business or business to consumers or people to people.	D
She brought to the Commission initially an incredible educational background, a graduate from Douglass College, in addition to that, a law degree from Boston College anthen went on angot a Master's Degree in Business Administration from Wharton.	D
Now, that's a pretty excellent backgrounto bring to the technical issues facing FCC anthe neeto understanboth the law as well as the business aspects.	D
We have been particularly prouof the job she's done in the FCC anthe challenges that she's taken a very keen interest in improving children's educational TV, promoting universal service anuniversal access, again, a very keen interest to be sure that you don't have a digital divide in the UniteStates of America between our children who have access to technology anthose who don't, the roll-out of digital television, new wireless service, expanding competition in telephone anvideo, efficient spectrum management.	D
Then she's also taken the work of unnecessary regulations, not what else can we do but what don't we have to do so we don't have to shackle this new worlof E business anE buzz.	D
In her work at the Federal/State Joint Board, she has representeus in WorlRadio Communications conferences in Switzerland.	D
She was the FCC's rep in 1995 an1997 anone of the areas that she's expresseinterest in, I know the Committee was very strong in this, this opening overseas market.	D
If we invent it, we want to be able to sell it anI think she's been a real champion of that.	D
She's been recognizeby her peers, a recipient of the International Radio anTV Society Foundation.	D
Electronic Media nameher as one of 12 to watch in 1997 anshe was honoreby the Women of Wireless anthe American Women in Radio anTV for all of her efforts.	D
I know that her family's here anthey have been very prouof her work as the two Senators have, anI believe that she will ably do it, continue to do a very able job on the Commission.	D
AnI think anybody who brings her owns mitts is always preparefor anything that lies aheaso I wholeheartedly endorse her renomination.	D
Before we take your statement, Commissioner, we have been joineby the distinguisheSenator from West Virginia.	N
I know it anthat is the reason I calleyou last night with great respect to ask your permission if I coultalk for about 60 seconds, anyou saiyes.	N
I want to do that because I so strongly support Susan Ness anI think it is incredibly important for the FCC that she be renominated.	N
She's taken from the telecommunication to regulation act every single aspect of that anworkeit through.	D
We've spent endless hours working together overcoming problems anshe's patient, understanding, knows it.	D
I didn't even know about The Wharton School until I was reading about it last night, but that's just another dimension.	N
She's been very strong on universal service, she's been very strong on consumer interest, anvery strong on trying to get compromise for a digital television standareffective on that.	D
She's pusheto move new technologies towarthe marketplace as quickly as possible, which I think is important for a Commissioner, anshe's been a very effective advocate for spectrum management policies that create a level playing fielfor all kinds of technologies.	D
But given all that, still I think the experience is the thing which is so important, the stability which is needeon the FCC.	D
I sorely suspect that they're understaffed, that they're under-funded, anI will have questions for her on that, but I'm extremely supportive of her renomination.	N
I think it's an absolute must for the success of the FCC in a situation where all the work that she does is moving much more quickly than we in Congress, where our committees were set up just after the seconWorlWar are prepareto deal with them, so we really neeSusan Ness.	D
Now we'll have a statement from Ms. Ness anwelcome this morning anbefore this Committee.	N
Mr. Chairman, let me just say hearing all these laudatory statements, that I think of the comment made by Winston Churchill in July 1945.	N
We haVE Day on May the 8th of 1945 anthe enof July, Mr. Churchill was voteout of office by Clement Atlee, anunder the rule in the UniteKingdom, you're supposeto be outside, which he was, of 10 Downing with his clothing rack anhis chest of drawers.	N
Here was a fellow who hawon the war to enall wars anin just 3 months' time they were getting riof him.	N
AnMs. Ness has been helup now since, what, almost a year, having done an outstanding job.	D
As Churchill says, don't look for gratitude, which she's got some goofriends here, anyou waiteentirely too long.	D
The only reason I asked, Mr. Chairman, for you to yieljust a seconis because I wanteto commenthe Commission on its rulings with respect to Section 271 now that we have haBell Atlantic.	N
You've institutean Enforcement Bureau, anlet's continue with that, because that's highly important that we don't think to just get approval anthen they don't have to still comply with their 14-point checklist.	N
The lawyers for the Bell companies wrote those 14 points, anI'm very, very much along with Senator Rockefeller in support of your renomination, anI hope we can get it in the next markup here so we can get it to the floor.	N
Well, I think maybe with citing Churchill anhis demise after WorlWar II, it stooby the olPresbyterian saying that no goodeeshall go unpunished, anwe may be in that sort of a situation, but I understanthat it is the Chairman of--the full Committee's intent is to move this nomination out of Committee, anthat's what I understannow, anyway, anI think that's a goosign.	N
We've been joineby the distinguisheSenator from North Dakota, west of the river, we might add, Senator Dorgan.	N
I think Senator Rockefeller indicatethat this is a Commission that very much needs her continueleadership.	D
I votefor all of them anI'm prouthey're there, but Commissioner Ness has been there anis the, as Senator Rockefeller indicated, the institutional memory.	N
But, more important from my standpoint anI think the standpoint of perhaps you anothers, Mr. Chairman, is as we implement the Telecommunications Act, the use of the Universal Service Funto builout the infrastructure for advancetelecommunications services will have a lot to do with how this country looks in the future.	N
It will have a lot to do with where people live, where jobs are created, where people move, where people do business.	N
If we have a country in which there is a digital divide ansmall towns anrural areas do not have the larger pipes or the advanceservices through which data can move, they are destinenot to attract economic development anjobs annew opportunities.	N
We must avoithat at all cost, anwe must take steps anactions to make sure that the Universal Service Funis useas the Act was written anintended.	N
The Universal Service Funin the Telecommunications Act is designenot only to facilitate the services of telephones at affordable prices, ancomparable service but in addition to that, we wrote into the Act that it relates to advancetelecommunications services or broadband, as well, so the connection of the Universal Service Funto that requirement anthat opportunity is critically important.	N
There's no one on the Commission who has a better understanding of that or understands the urgency of that better than Commissioner Ness.	D
As someone representing a rural state, it is imperative that we keep Commissioner Ness on that Commission fighting for those issues.	D
This is not a case of her fighting our fight on these issues at the expense of someone else.	N
It is the fact that the implementation of the Telecommunications Act is working quite well in some areas of the country.	N
There is robust, aggressive competition where there is an income stream to justify it, anwe all understanthat.	N
I just haa meeting a moment ago when a colleague of mine, Senator Burns, took out his Palm VII ansomeone said, ``Is that wireless?''	N
Anthe point he was making just by answering the inquiry was yeah, this is wireless anit's wonderful, I'm glaI have it this morning in Washington, DC but in Montana, it doesn't work.	N
Wouldn't work in North Dakota, either, because we don't have ubiquitous services all across this country anthe build-	N
I think everyone at this dais at this point has an interest in seeing that rural areas experience the full flower of opportunity coming from the Telecommunications Act.	N
Well, like I said, the Chairman has already indicatethat he is going to move this nomination out of Committee so we're happy about that.	N
Let me start off by--I don't know of anybody that I've hathe opportunity to work with since I come to Washington, DC, ansince you were put on the Commission that we have haa very, very gooworking relationship anI want--anI appreciate your accessibility.	N
Also, we've done some things in the country anyou've been very, very, very active in furthering those things, anthose things we are concerneabout in rural areas anhow universal service works anhow we are seeing the roll-	D
There's a couple of areas that I have concerns about, if you wouljust help me along a little bit, that has to do with Section 706, of course, in the Telecom Act.	N
I haquite a lot to do with that Section anthe build-out of technology into rural areas anthis type thing anbroadbandeployment in this thing.	N
Coulyou give the Committee your view of the current state of that broadbanroll-out in America anspecifically in rural areas?	N
Do you think the Commission has been aggressive, as aggressive as it shoulhave been in implementing 706?	N
Give me an idea of when you start looking at a section like that in the deployment of broadband, have we haa disagreement on the Commission on how it shoulbe implementeor what the Commission shoulbe doing.	N
Now, let's face it, now, in my state of Montana anlike the state of West Virginia anthe state of North Dakota, we are not exactly--	N
Billings, Montana may be rural by the measurement that we use nationwide, anthen when we go to Lewistown, Montana, that's frontier, angoing back to some olterms usein Medicare anthings.	N
Senator Dorgan is exactly right on the build-out, anif we're going to have any kinof economic chance to stay up with the rest of the worlin a national or a global economy, broadbanis essential out there.	N
We've got a situation now in rural America that is not a very pretty picture, anuntil America wants to pay more for its bread, we're going to continue to be in a very, very--in an economic state that we're very uncomfortable in in our area, so we know it's very important.	N
Thank you, Commissioner Ness, for coming in front of the group ananswering some questions.	N
I want to turn if I coulto some specific questions regarding particularly Bell Atlantic's application to get into in-region long distance service in New York, but not so much that but the template it sets for future roll-outs there.	N
In the separate statement that you issuein conjunction with the Commission's approval of Bell Atlantic's application to provide in-region long distance service in New York, you indicatethat it woulhave been in your words unfair to penalize Bell Atlantic for its recoron DSL loop performance at this time, close quote.	N
You state that, quote, because the consumer market for broadbanservices has only recently begun to develop, enquote, the FCC collaborative process dinot adequately address the ordering anprovisioning of DSL-capable loops.	N
Then you go on to say that our evaluation of future applications will be focuseon this issue.	N
Now, in reading all of those together it sounds a lot like that you may be favoring an ever-expanding checklist before other applicants are going to be allowethese same opportunities that were provideto Bell Atlantic, anI'm concerneif that is the case, if there's going to be more items on the checklist, that people don't know about, anI woullike for you to tell us today, is the checklist set now for applicants seeking to provide that long distance service?	N
So the checklist for future applications will remain the same as it was for Bell Atlantic's application when it went through the FCC?	N
I want to make sure that companies in making their applications know here's the hurdles we have to clear anthat they're set anthere are not additional ones that are put after the first one has been cleared.	N
We're now in 2000 anit seems like it's taken quite a while to implement this Act, anI woulhope that those checklists coulbe set, firmeup aneverybody know what they have to meet to get into long distance services.	N
In your statement accompanying the Commission's May 7, 1997 Universal Service Order you indicateyou thought the FCC hamade substantial progress anestablishea clear timetable for implementation of that Telecommunications Act which was enacteinto law February 8th of 1996, which in telecommunications development is ancient history, I suppose, given this rate of change.	N
Diyou really think that 4 years after the bill became law that the FCC woulstill not have fully implementethe high-	N
cost provisions of Section 254? Do you consider how long it has taken anhow much further we have to go for a clear timetable there?	N
If I might submit to you, 4 years is a long time, given the rate of change that's taken place in telecommunications anthe platform for the new economy that it's providing, anby not having this issue resolved, it further impedes investment into rural another high-cost areas.	N
I woulreally hope we coulstep, you know, step up the implementation of that so the rural areas anthose providing telephony another services woulknow what they've got to work with.	N
Last year I introducelegislation that prohibits the application of spectrum caps to new spectrum that is auctionein the future.	N
One of the reasons I introducethe bill was to accelerate the introduction of advance services, including wireless Internet access another data services, for which operators neesubstantially more spectrum in order to provide the service.	N
Given the fact that some of the spectrums from C anF block licenses is not currently being used, is it safe to conclude that relief from the spectrum cap coulbe grantefor these licenses without risking industry consolidation?	N
If so, shouldn't relief be granteto ensure that advance wireless services develop without behinrelevancies?	N
Well, I'hopethat we coulprovide those anmake them available so that more of the advance services woulbe available.	N
It's very interesting, in fact, that our Committee system was in fact set up many, many years ago having absolutely no idea of the science antechnology kinds of changes.	N
Then you have the phenomenon of a Senate where, oh, I guess there's maybe a couple in their 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's an90's are the ages, anso therefore, our making a policy or deciding not to make policy for the purposes of the advancement of science antechnology in telecommunications is very important.	N
But it also, I think, means that the Federal Communications Commission is even more important, because we really don't have the experience by virtue of generation, although many of us are trying, that the Commission does, anparticularly you, because as I indicated, you are the only member of the Commission who has servesince, you know, the Telecommunications Act was passed.	N
Senator Brownback indicatethat that was really a very long time ago, but it seems like yesterday, anwhat I woullike to do, if you woulsort of reflect on some of the issues that--you've learnefrom this very kinof difficult transition from what appeareto be a relatively clear act to the four years.	N
That includes, as I indicated, under-funding, getting suefor every single thing that you do or whatever.	N
Senator Snowe anI later this week are going to be introducing a rural telecommunications bill that addresses what Senator Dorgan is also very concerneabout, anthat is the build-out of broadbanin rural areas or, rather, the lack of build-out.	N
Anit's very interesting to look at what Bell Atlantic anothers plan in terms of broadbanin West Virginia, anit basically covers five of our 55 counties anignores all the others.	N
Anthat gets you into another definition of the digital divide, not just the use of computers but the use of data flow, individual, you know, flow, anall the rest of it anat what speed--you know, what's the upload, what's the downloatime, et cetera.	N
Anso Senator Snowe anI are going to be introducing this bill which provides a tax credit to them.	N
AnI'm not necessarily a tax credit type of Senator, but I think that, you know, if that will help telecommunications expananbuilout into rural areas, anwe define rural areas in a particular way--anthis doesn't go on forever.	N
Most people on this Committee come from rural states anvery much like the Finance Committee, which useto be an Oil anGas Committee, is now pretty much a rural Committee, anI wouljust be interestein your concept in terms of what it might be like in 10 years or what needs to happen over those 10 years.	N
You know, Senator Dorgan saithat comparable services include not just universal service but also broadband, anthat's in the law, anyet here I am offering a tax credit bill to try anentice companies to do something which under the law they ought to be doing, anthat worries me.	N
Aneven the tax credit bill which Senator Snowe anI are going to introduce, I think the telecommunications companies like that but, on the other hand, even that will not cover all of West Virginia.	N
It's just going to be an increment of improvement anI think that, you know, I just think that's terribly important.	N
I was in two of them, anin one of them, there was an Internet company because there habeen a special build-out for them but for nobody else within a hundremiles in any direction.	N
Commissioner, I believe neither Senator Snowe nor I have voteanthere's a vote probably about to finish so we will have to leave in a moment, anI'm unable to come back because I'm Ranking Member on an appropriations subcommittee that is meeting as well, so I have to be there.	N
First of all, there's no living American who can interpret his or her phone bill these days.	N
You know, you get a phone bill for 25 dollars anit's eight ana half pages ancompletely not understandable.	N
AnI actually just made some calls to the carrier some while ago just for fun to see if they coulexplain it to me anthey couldn't, so the people who sent me the bill don't know why they senme the bill, anit's eight to ten pages for $30.	N
Seconon the issue of truth in billing, I have felt that you shoulconnect access charge reform to universal service.	N
What's happeneis you're giving companies access charge reductions to the tune of billions of dollars anthey take those reductions anthey smile anthey say that's fine, we like that, but now what we're going to do is to tell the consumer in one line on our billing the universal service requirement.	N
So they put a few dollars on that phone bill that says, ``Here's what we've got to do because the government says we have to do it.''	N
Truth in billing woulrequire that they tell the customer the whole story, anthat is something we ought to be concerneabout.	N
I think you ought to tie access charge reform specifically to universal service--connect those two numbers.	N
We want those companies that want to meet the checklist, go through it, anbecome competitive ando long distance.	N
We want them to do that anso we want the checklist not to be an insurmountable barrier, but the reason that this hasn't happeneas quickly as some woulsuggest.	N
The Senator from Kansas wonderewhy some companies have not made it a decision, anthey want to make the checklist.	N
It requires a company that says my company's goal is to meet this checklist, then take steps to do it.	N
Some companies have been pretty slow off the blocks in that regard, but for those that want to (annow many of them do), we don't want meeting the checklist to be an insurmountable barrier--we want it to be reasonable.	N
I'm going to ask--Bob Rowe from the National Association of Rural Utility Commissioners is working on a regional test to OSS testing under the 271 process.	N
AnI probably won't be able to listen to them, anso if you will perhaps senme a note on that, I woulappreciate it.	N
We haven't voteanI have been taking some time that Senator Snowe perhaps wants to take as well, so Commissioner Ness, consider those issues.	N
I'm sorry that I wasn't able to be here earlier but there are so many conflicting meetings this morning.	N
I want to take this opportunity to welcome Commissioner Ness to this Committee anfor her nomination for a seconterm on the FCC.	N
I applauher for the work that she has done, particularly in the area in upholding the universal service subsidy anproviding the discounts to schools anlibraries anhealth care facilities in all parts of the country.	D
Anbeyonher commitment in providing leadership at the FCC anchairing the Joint State-Federal Boaron Universal Service.	D
Commissioner Ness also is very knowledgeable anexperiencein so many of the telecommunications matters that are going to have an impact on the future of this country anis also committeto enforcing the laws as Congress intended.	D
Commissioner Ness, we appreciate your commitment to enforcing the laws according to the spirit of the statutes as passeby Congress over the years concerning telecommunications.	D
As Senator Rockefeller indicated, I do share his concern about the extent to which competition has reachethe rural areas.	D
Certainly, the intent of the Telecommunications Act in the deregulation of the telecommunications industry was to bring competition to the rural areas of the country, as well.	N
That has been much slower, anI hope that the FCC anyou will give it specific attention, particularly in terms of bringing broadbanto rural areas, anthat's why Senator Rockefeller anI are looking at providing a tax credit as a way of expediting broadbandelivery to rural areas.	N
In addition, I hope that you can address this Committee in terms of what the FCC is doing to bring about competition in all areas because it is going to continue to make a difference in the have anhave-	N
breaking, unprecedentemerger between AOL anTime-Warner that may or may not have advantages or disadvantages at this time.	N
I think it is difficult to say, but I woulalso appreciate your views anperspective on these mergers anwhat kinof benefits or disadvantages do they bring to the consumers anwhat can we expect in the future.	N
So again, Commissioner Ness, thank you for the work that you have done anI hope that we can expedite your reconfirmation here because I think you have done a superb job on the Commission.	D
Going on in this, in some mergers I think you're entirely correct, some mergers are beneficial to the consumer analso the way we do business, some are not, anyou have to look I guess at mergers on a case-by-case basis.	N
Anwe knew at some date content woultake over anbe the driving force of the Internet, anI think we have enterethe era of that.	N
There are some areas of that that concern you, there are some areas that I think will be very beneficial.	N
Sometimes when mergers happen, everybody that is under that same tent it seems like it's very competitive with each other, anif that competition continues, why, I think that's a very goosign.	N
It just seems like the Commission without the direction of Congress just took off anstartemaking policy with regarto low-power radio, ansome of our most vocal critics has been those folks in public radio, the translater interference, this kinof interference, anI wouljust like your view on low power.	N
Why do you think the Commission has to take an active role that goes beyonthe intent, what I believe is not the intent of Congress?	N
Why woulwe--even though the engineers at the FCC maybe do not have the same concerns as engineers across the country, I mean, I've not been into one major market antalketo engineering people that do not have concerns.	N
You see, I have the opinion that even though low power ansome folks who want to put a low-power station shoulgo through the same rigors of establishing a radio station that any other commercial broadcaster or public broadcaster makes when they establish an entity to do that anapply for spectrum in order to do it.	N
We have between newspapers ancable anbroadcast industries anthose entities, I woullike your views on that, please.	N
Do you have a guiding principle whenever you start making these decisions on cross-ownership?	N
Is there any way that you have a philosophy on shoulthe newspaper be able to own--anwe have three television stations.	N
Any guiding light on shoula newspaper in Billings, Montana be able to own a broadcast property there under those conditions?	N
That's like the olHarry Truman statement: Spenthe first 6 months when you're here trying to figure out how you got here, then the next 6 months trying to figure out how everybody else got here.	N
It means millions of dollars in funding for school children anlibraries to access the Internet.	N
It means insuring spectrum access for utility workers after a tornado enabling the troops of the 82Airborne at Fort Benning to have more than adequate communication capability with their commanding officers when performing defense maneuvers.	N
More anmore of them are making their homes in my state anaccess to broadbanservices--a number of services in addition to just telephone.	N
I look forwarto hearing some of your ideas about your philosophy of the last 5 years of service anwhat you woullike to do the next five.	N
Ms. Ness, as you know, Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act encourages the deployment of ``advancetelecommunications capability.''	N
The report the FCC issuein response statethat this technology is being deployeon a timely basis.	N
I woullike to know what is your opinion on the employment of advanceservices anwhat type of role do you see the E rate Program playing in achieving the goals of Section 706?	N
The 1996 act also requires co-location aninterconnection with existing ILECs, incumbent local exchange carriers in their facilities.	N
In your statement following the approval of Bell Atlantic's Section 271 application you indicatethat previous FCC decisions, ``adequately addressethe ordering anprovisioning of extant DSL loops;'' however, you saiour evaluation of future applications will, indeed, focus on this issue.	N
I've been informeof the excellent work the FCC's wireless bureau has done in reducing its backlog of paperwork.	N
A great deal of the work the wireless bureau does directly impacts the spectrum allocation in the UniteStates, which I hear is increasingly a challenge.	N
As you know, there's a great deal of exciting wireless technology that claims to reduce the amount of spectrum needefor this technology to operate while increasing the power ancapability of wireless products.	N
Five years ago when you were approveby the Senate to sit on the FCC, so much of the technology anso many of the companies that are out there today in many ways didn't even exist or, shall we say, were not even on the radar screen 5 years ago.	N
Just seeing that incredible advance of technology, anthe incredible investment in information antelecommunications technologies ancompanies that raise hair on our heads whenever we contemplate the billions anhundreds of billions investein these companies, isn't it quite a challenge as we walk into the 21st century together that over the next 5 years, just what might happen?	N
You might see a neefor the FCC to update or revamp or come up to speeon, anadjust or reform some of its practices anits own workings in order to keep up with the worlthat is growing exponentially at an incredible rate of speed.	N
When I look at just the last 5 years anlook at the prospect of what might happen in the information technology antelecommunications in the next 5 years, it's stunning what might happen in the next ten.	N
So I just offer my worof support not only for your nomination anyour further service on the FCC, but count on me to help you adapt to the neefor speein this incredible worlwhere government hopefully can adapt quickly enough ansurely enough to be responsive to industry but also continue to protect the public interest.	N
No, Mr. Chairman, but I woullike to note that which I dinot before, that Commissioner Tristani is here anI just think that's very nice.	N
I want to do some followup with you, Commissioner, with regarto I want to ask you--anI think this is better done in probably a private conversation, not keeping it from anyone, but I have some concerns about how we deal with spectrum anhow we go through the auction business anhow we handle it if it's repossesseanhow we shouluse that anthe FCC's role.	N
I think we're going to consider in Congress how we deal with spectrum once it is owneanhow much control do we have to relinquish as a government, or do we lose complete control of that spectrum?	N
I woullike to kinof ferret that out a little bit with you, anI think we can do that in private conversation, but there are some things happening that does concern Congress or at least this Member of Congress, anyway, with regarto dealing with spectrum anallocations anits use.	N
I woulask you that you might responto the individual Senators anto the Committee for its review, anthat's all the questions I have today, other than the fact that I'll be in touch with you as far as the spectrum is concerned.	N
But I want to thank you for coming today anresponding to the questions, anappreciate your cooperation anI look forwarin moving this nomination.	N
Well, Mr. Won, we intento move your nomination on this markup so that you can be reappointed.	N
Do you have any questions for Mr. Won, who is nominee for reappointment to a seconterm at the Federal Maritime Commission?	N
As we were talking before you came in the room, I realizethat I have known Norman Mineta now for 30 years.	N
In 1970, I was President of the San Francisco Boarof Supervisors, he was a member of the San Jose City Council.	D
He then went on to become Vice Mayor anthen in 1971 to 1974 Mayor of the City of San Jose.	D
In 1942 when he was 11, his family was among the 120,000 Japanese Americans forcibly removeto internment camps on the West Coast because of their ancestry.	D
I think fittingly, one of his career highlights in Congress was his leadership in the enactment of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which callefor a formal apology an$20,000 in compensation to each Japanese American survivor of these internment camps.	D
He graduatefrom the University of California-Berkeley in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science in Business.	D
Upon his return, he enterethe insurance business anbecame active in San Jose urban affairs.	D
He serveon the San Jose Human Relations Commission anthe San Jose Housing Authority prior to his tenure on the City Council.	D
In 1967, he was the first ethnic minority electeto the City Council anthat began his string of firsts.	D
In 1971, he was electeMayor of San Jose becoming the first Japanese American Mayor of a major city.	D
In 1974, he became the first Japanese American from the continental UniteStates to be electeto the House of Representatives.	D
When he assumethe chairmanship of the House Committee on Public Works anTransportation, he became the first American of Asian ancestry to chair a major committee in the House.	D
Of course, shoulthe Senate confirm his nomination as Commerce Secretary, he woulbecome the first Asian American to serve in the President's cabinet.	D
The older I get, I finsometimes there are two kinds of people, problem makers anproblem solvers.	N
I think his 21 years of experience on the Hill in a whole panoply of committee assignments, anparticularly as Chairman of the Committee on Public Works anTransportation, demonstrates a very soliknowledge of the interreaction between people anbusiness.	D
He has the knowledge, he has the legislative background, he has the experience, anhe has the ability, I think, to be a very fine Secretary of Commerce.	D
So Mr. Chairman, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I am here this morning simply to indicate my strong support anmy hope, as you just stated, that this Committee will speedily process his confirmation.	N
I want to associate myself with the remarks of my senior Senator, anI will not be repetitive.	N
My heart is full of joy today anit is full of joy for Norm, for his family, for Asian Americans, for all Americans, because, Mr. Chairman, I know you know this anyou believe this, that when we do open the door to all of our people we are such a better Nation.	N
What it means is that the door will be openeto so many others who might not have been considered.	N
I just want to say, when I servewith Norm for 10 years in the House of Representatives, Senator Feinstein is right, a problem solver.	D
Mr. Chairman, I hope you will have the opportunity in the brief time that is left on this particular term to work with this fine, soon to be I hope Commerce Secretary, because in his district there are so many different points of view anso much diversity anso many Democrats, so many Republicans, independents.	N
He was able to bring everyone together, which is a wonderful trait, anmake progress for everyone.	D
So Norm, you bring us joy today, anI am just pleasethat you askeme to be here with you.	N
Mr. Chairman anmembers of the Committee: I am most privilegeto be here this morning to join the distinguisheSenators of California to support Norm Mineta for the office of Secretary of Commerce.	N
Here is a young man who, at a time when he was beginning to understanthe complexities of society, hato leave his home with his parents to go to a desolate strange place in Wyoming calleHot Mountain, anthere he spent nearly 2 years.	D
But insteaof leading a life of gloom anbitterness, he returnehome dedicateto serve his country.	D
As Senator Feinstein anSenator Boxer have indicated, he serveon the San Jose City Council, then became mayor ana distinguishemember of the Congress.	D
I woulassociate myself with the glowing remarks of our distinguishewitnesses anthe opening statement that you made.	N
The American public will be fortunate again to have his service in their behalf as the Secretary of Commerce.	N
I enthusiastically support anendorse the nomination and, like you, Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that we can move this nomination as quickly as possible so that Mr. Mineta will be able to assume his duties anresponsibilities on behalf of the American public.	N
On a personal note, having known him for 20 years, I am very pleasefor him personally anhis family.	N
I just pointeout to Senator Inouye, I have been on this Committee, Congressman Mineta--I guess I have to call you for the moment--I have hearmany presentations of candidates, but I have never hearthem give such a deep anemotional support for a candidate.	N
I share that view, anI share particularly the historical significance that Senator Inouye referreto.	N
He dinot say that you are the first Asian American cabinet member, anhe dinot specifically talk about internments aninjustices done, but they were in his comments anin his heart.	N
I think it is a powerful day that America becomes whole as you become the first Asian American to serve in the UniteStates Cabinet.	D
During the course of questioning we will talk about steel, which you anI have discussed, the digital divide, anthe whole question of spectrum division.	N
You have the toughness, the experience, the executive experience, the legislative experience, the personal nature of conflict resolution, bringing people together, the intensity of public service, the concept of public service which is so valuable anincreasingly rare.	D
Although I think it lies in the hearts of all Americans, it is not manifesteas it once was.	N
I am embarrasseon behalf of the Committee that there are not more of us here to join you.	N
It is a little bit like Internet access, having a computer in your home as opposeto just at the schools when that happenein every classroom.	N
It is almost like something is being built into your DNA, that you are predestineby the currents of the economy to make it or not anthere comes to be very little that you can do about it, because this is not something that an individual can--I mean, sure, somebody from southern West Virginia can decide, well, I am going to go to Carnegie Mellon University anbecome a real computer science pro.	N
Cisco has Cisco Academies all over the country, all over the world, trying to do their best.	N
So I really understanit when people talk about the digital divide as being the next civil rights movement, with all of the passions anthe dangers anin many ways, since much of the civil rights movement was nonviolent baseupon that philosophy, this will not necessarily be that way, because we are not just talking about America here.	N
We are talking about the African subcontinent that the chairman was speaking about, others across the worlwho do not have this.	N
If they are denietechnology anthey feel that it is built into their DNA, so to speak, that there is no way out for them antherefore they are condemneto low wages ana life of poverty--anI think this will happen unless intervention is made on a massive scale--that they will resort to using the very technology that they do not have against those who do have it.	N
I think this is the whole question of international terrorism in a new form, where people are simply angry because they have been systemically anpredictably left out ancan see that from a very early age.	N
I will pass ansimply submit my question on spectrum management to you in the interest of time.	N
But there is simply no way for me to talk strongly enough about what I think the digital divide is in the process of doing to this country.	N
I see it in the State of New Mexico that you referreto a few moments ago, anmany other rural areas.	N
I see it in broadbanwhere Bell Atlantic, which is our phone company, has broadbanplans, but they have it for 5 of our 55 counties anthey are all contiguous anthey are where all the people are anwhere all the people of wealth are.	N
But the counties like Calhoun County, where you have 26 to 30 percent unemployment, rural areas, which in a State which is 96 percent mountainous is obviously preordained, too, they have no part.	N
We will make every effort to do it before the recess, anI know that the other members of the Committee will join in that.	N
So I will not make that my closing comment because I see our frienSenator Ashcroft here.	N
Well, Secretary Daley hacommunicateto me in a document that was a fact sheet that outlinethe staffing another things.	N
The seconissue I want to address is a little broader than China and, frankly, I have a China trade enforcement bill callethe Show-Me Act.	N
I will be looking for ways to raise the issues in my bill in the context of the PNTR debate, but if I can get a commitment from the administration that you woulpursue these principles of enforcement in a broader context in the WTO then I think that woulbe more appropriate than simply focusing on China.	N
It is my belief that the U.S. has lost a measure of its leverage or its enforcement capacity in the WTO to get actual implementation of cases that we have won in the WTO, that we frequently will litigate an offense against the UniteStates or its businesses in the context of the dispute resolution mechanisms providefor in WTO, we get the decision, but the enforcement measures providefor as a result of the decision do not really get us compliance.	N
So that the decisionmaking process ends up in sort of authorizing continuenoncompliance upon the payment of a certain fee, which is the fine or the penalty.	N
So that in my judgment in many respects the WTO has become a way to license noncompliance by paying a fee, rather than to enforce compliance.	N
I think one of the problems that exists here is that the standards for leverage or retaliation or response to noncompliance once determinein the setting of dispute resolution, the standards have changed.	N
In 1947 the standarwas that you haresponse or leverage or retaliation ``appropriate in the circumstances to achieve the objective,'' the objective being the purpose of the free trade or access to the market or to make sure that the agreement was enforced.	N
Under the GATT 1947, article 23, paragraph 2, it authorizes ``suspension of such concessions or other obligations under this agreement as they are determineto be appropriate in the circumstances,'' anGATT case law says this standarmust be liberal enough ``to achieve the objective.''	N
Now, in 1994 under the WTO the standarfor enforcement was changeanit was a standarthat was equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment.	N
The dispute settlement understanding, article 22.4, says that the suspension level must be ``equivalent'' to the level of nullification or impairment.	N
Now, in the U.S.-EU banana case, for example, the equivalency test is strictly interpreted.	N
This 1994 change has affecteour rights--in Europe, $120 million over 10 years to try to enforce the beef case we have been trying to enforce, anwe still do not have access to the European market for American beef.	N
The banana retaliation was whittledown by the WTO from a $520 million U.S. request down to a $191 million situation.	N
It seems to me that we neeto have robust enforcement for these trade agreements or else the trade agreements do not really achieve their intendepurpose.	N
I notethat in the Far East in the not too far distant past we were able to get compliance by China in terms of our intellectual property demands by having robust threats for enforcement, anyou are very familiar with their piracy, prevalent piracy at one time, of the intellectual property of the folks from your home district.	N
But we threatene$4.6 billion of retaliation over the last 5 years to enforce those property rights and, frankly, that has worked.	N
As we move from non-WTO status to WTO status, we give up some of our other capacity to determine the levels of our own retaliation.	N
So without belaboring the question, I woullike to invite your ideas about whether you think it might be possible for or whether you think it woulbe wise to pursue a way for these trade agreements to be enforced, trade agreements to be enforcein ways that are sufficient to get us to a place of compliance with the agreement, rather than being enforceat a level which provides basically a license that can be purchasewith a fine that is a basis for noncompliance.	N
What I was really saying was this, that under the non-WTO framework we have been successful in eliciting compliance when we hathe robust leverage potential of 301.	N
Anif we give that up going into the WTO, which has proveto be, at least as it relates to our access to European markets for beef, our access to European markets for fresh fruit, that in each of those cases it has been notably deficient.	N
I want to, really want to have the assurance that the administration cares about the deficiency, recognizes it, anwoulbe eager to work towarimproving our ability not just to have some enforcement, which results more in just the perpetuation of the noncompliance, but to have a kinof enforcement that will get us to the place where the agreements we negotiatewill be the terms anconditions under which we live.	N
We appreciate your continuation in public service anyour willingness to, as Shakespeare said, take the slings anarrows of outrageous fortune.	D
Let me just say, being on the Commerce Committee here anseeing the transition from just commerce to e-commerce, I know the FTC gets involveanthe FCC gets involvein e-commerce.	N
What do you see as the role of maybe the Commerce Department in the near future in terms of e-commerce?	N
Are there some rules of the roathat have applieto commerce in general, especially interstate commerce, for the last say 100 years or so that we might want to consider as we look at e-commerce, or is this such a new baby that we better take hands off until we see how things progress?	N
Ultimately, do you see that maybe government might have some kinof backstop role, some kinof fundamental role here in maybe guaranteeing privacy or working out some accommodation vis a vis the Internet taxation?	N
We will be certainly looking to you for your guidance anyour continueleadership on these another issues.	N
I just want to thank you again for your willingness to serve anI look forwarto working with you.	N
You certainly have my support in your confirmation anI am prouto see the President nominate you.	N
But what I woulpropose to do here is to have Dr. Bailey, after Frank Lautenberg has saiwhat he wants to say, to have you make your statement.	N
So now it is in all of our interests to listen to the distinguisheSenator from New Jersey.	N
Knowing how much you anI like our particular phase of public service, it then makes me feel pretty goowhen I have a chance to introduce someone who can help us serve the public as they ought to be served.	D
I am pleaseto introduce her, Mr. Chairman, to the Committee, anask for expeditious treatment, so that she can do the job that we desperately want to have done.	N
But when we look at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, we know that we have got an important task there.	N
It is the agency that is responsible for the safety of millions of American motorists antheir families.	N
It sets performance standards for motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, investigates safety defects, helps states reduce the threat of drunk drivers, researches driving behavior--that has got to be an endless pursuit--anpromote the use of safety seatbelts anairbags.	N
We have just been through what is a wrenching experience for all of America, anfor those of us in Government as well, when we look at the controversy now that exists over the tire failures anthe dispute between Firestone anFord.	N
I watcheDr. Bailey's testimony in the Appropriation Subcommittee on Transportation anit was just excellent.	N
A distinguisheSenator from Florida who has wanderein, obviously thinking this was another room, to present somebody.	N
There are so many great Americans out there, but all of them do not have a chance to serve in this very demanding capacity.	D
She is responsible for the health of 8.2 million military personnel anoversaw a $16 billion defense health program.	D
She incorporatethe President's Patients Bill of Rights into military medicine, anbolsterethe role of preventive medicine in the U.S. ArmeForces.	D
She is a graduate of the University of Marylananthe Philadelphia College of Osteopathy, completeher internship at George Washington University andiher residency at Johns Hopkins University Hospital.	D
In deference to your time schedule anthe vote that is underway, I woulrequest permission to file my full statement for the record.	N
Mr. Chairman, Ms. Joyner does not have a family member in a biological sense, but she has Mr. Chris Hart who is a member of the Hillsborough County Commission anon the Hillsborough Aviation Authority.	N
I apologize for this most unorthodox way of conducting a short hearing after a very long hearing which is sometimes, I think, actually quite helpful because you can get into things.	N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you for holding this hearing on this important position.	N
In 1991 Mary Sheila Gall was nominateto the Consumer Product Safety Commission by President George Bush.	D
The task of the CPSC is an important one, to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries andeaths associatewith consumer products.	N
Between 1991 an1999, Commissioner Gall votewith the majority of the three-member Commission the vast majority of times, supportethe Commission's enforcement actions, ansought substantial fines ancriminal penalties against companies that violatethe Consumer Product Safety Act another statutes enforceby the CPSC.	D
During this time, Commissioner Gall also cast a number of votes that have since become the focus of efforts to derail her nomination.	D
In 1992, Commissioner Gall votewith both of her colleagues against a rulemaking to put choking hazarlabels on marbles, balloons, ansmall toys.	D
One year later she voted, again unanimously, not to begin a rulemaking on baby walkers, opting insteato urge the continueimprovement of the product through voluntary standards.	D
In 1994, Commissioner Gall voted, again with the majority, not to begin a rulemaking on baby bath seats after a petition to ban them was filed.	D
Also in 1994, in response to a petition fileby the National Association of State Fire Marshals, Commissioner Gall votenot to begin a rulemaking on upholsterefurniture flammability standards.	D
That time it was to modify the standards for children's sleepwear so as not to require sleepwear for children under 9 months or snug-fitting sleepwear to be flame resistant.	N
Gall reasonethat parents were putting their children in untreated, more comfortable loose cotton garments rather than the fire-resistant fabrics anthat it was safer for children to sleep in snug, untreatepajamas, which were less likely to catch fire.	D
Since then, Chairman Brown has agreethat the CPSC shoulnot expenadditional resources to reconsider this 1996 action.	N
That same year, Commissioner Gall voted, this time in the minority, not to initiate a rulemaking on crib slats, commenting that the voluntary standards process hanot been given time to work, but cautioning that regulation might still be requireif the voluntary process proveinadequate.	D
After casting all of these votes, for which she is now being portrayeas a cold-hearteindustry pawn, in 1999--in 1999 Commissioner Gall was renominateto a secon7-year term by President Bill Clinton.	D
On June 17th, 1999, the Commerce Committee hela hearing on the nomination, during which I was the only member of the Committee to pose questions.	N
On June 23rd, 1999, the Committee recommendeby voice vote, with no audible dissension, that Ms. Gall's nomination be favorably reporteto the full Senate.	D
On July 1, by unanimous consent anwithout a single statement of opposition or concern being entereinto the record, Mary Sheila Gall was reconfirmeto a seconfull term at the CPSC.	D
Earlier this year, President Bush indicatehis intent to nominate Commissioner Gall to Chair of the CPSC.	D
The Senate has already unanimously concurreon Ms. Gall's qualifications to be the CPSC Commissioner.	D
I believe that the President is entitleto his prerogative to select the Chairman anthat the Senate shoulin most instances defer to his judgment.	N
I also believe the President has made a goochoice with Commissioner Gall, who during her tenure at the CPSC has demonstrateher commitment to reason, to fair process, anto safety.	D
What I do not believe, however, is the line that Commissioner Gall's opponents have developerecently to justify their opposition to her, anthis line is that Mary Sheila Gall, while perfectly fine as a CPSC Commissioner, is not qualifieto chair the Commission.	D
It is a collegial body whose agenda anbudget are set by all three Commissioners, all of whom have an equal vote in rulemakings anenforcement actions.	N
It is because the Commissioners must work so closely that Commissioner Thomas Moore, a Democrat who has been at the CPSC since 1995, has come to know her philosophy anwork intimately.	D
It is Commissioner Moore who offers what is in my minthe most persuasive commentary on her nomination.	N
In response to an article that appearein USA Today earlier this year, Commissioner Moore wrote: ``I was dismayeto reathe article in the April 25th USA Today giving an unfairly negative slant to the recoranbeliefs of Mary Sheila Gall, my fellow Commissioner at the Consumer Product Safety Commission.''	D
He continued: ``During my 6 years at the agency, I have been impresseby Commissioner Gall's harwork, the thoughtful consideration of every issue, anbeen persuadeon occasion by her arguments.	D
For her part, she has been willing to change her views after hearing her colleagues on certain matters.	D
But whether we agree on an issue of note, I can finnothing in her views or her voting recorto cause me any alarm about her assuming the chairmanship of the agency.''	D
Finally, he said: ``While I may have a different opinion from Commissioner Gall on some aspects of Commission business, I have no doubt she will listen to my views anthat, however she votes, her decision will be well-reasoneangive expression to a valiviewpoint shareby many, perhaps the majority of Americans.''	D
I commenMs. Gall for her service to the CPSC anto this country anI commenher also for her willingness to face the tough, but I hope fair, questions she will be asketoday.	D
CoulI just say, Mr. Chairman, you have always treateevery nominee in my knowledge in my years of experience with you in a fair anobjective fashion, anI appreciate that anI know that the witness does today.	N
Mr. Chairman, I will wrap up with this, by way of saying that certainly, Ms. Gall, there are examples where the federal government has overreachein a variety of areas, but when you use the words ``federal Nanny State'' in a lot of quarters that is code for saying that there shoulnot be an activist role for the government in the consumer protection area.	N
I think there are a number of issues that neeto be explored, but I will tell you, to vote for you I neeto be confident that your philosophy is not incompatible with the basic mission of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect the consumer, kids, seniors, anothers, because otherwise we are talking about bringing a fox into the henhouse, anthat is something I cannot support.	N
Mr. Chairman, thanks for calling this hearing today, anI am pleaseto lenmy support to the President's nominee, Mary Sheila Gall, as Chairwoman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	N
It shoulbe notethat Commissioner Gall has a distinguisherecorof public service, having serveher country for almost 30 years in many executive anlegislative branch positions.	D
Commissioner Gall has also extensive experience with consumer safety issues, having serveas Commissioner since 1991, anas Vice Chairman of the Commission for the past 5 years.	D
Commissioner Gall also serveas Assistant Commission of the U.S. Department of Health anHuman Services in the first Bush Administration, where she workeclosely on issues affecting children, families, anthe disabled.	D
I will be very brief because I am looking forwarto the opportunity to ask the witness questions.	N
The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in my judgment, plays an enormously important role in this country, providing protection for consumers from products that are unsafe anparticularly providing protection for those who cannot protect themselves, young children anbabies.	N
Obviously, the Chairman of that commission has an elevateresponsibility over the other commission members.	N
I am still open-minded, still willing to listen to aninterestein listening to your answers to questions.	N
I do have to tell you, Ms. Gall, I have reservations, though, anthose reservations grow out of some instances in your recorwhere it appears that fairly minor changes coulhave been made in products that woulhave made them safer, woulhave protectekids, anyour reaction seems to have been to finthe responsibility with others--parents, adults.	D
I just have to tell you, I do not think--anI agree only with part of what my colleague from Nevada just said.	N
If they are exposeto a product that coulby reasonable means be made safer, that woulkeep them from being hurt, I do not think that anparental responsibility are mutually exclusive.	N
We ought to do everything in our power to make sure parents are properly educateabout the dangers associatewith products.	N
I think the Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission has an enormous responsibility to those children who cannot protect themselves, ananything that can reasonably be done to make a product safe ought to be done.	N
It appears to me from looking at what I have seen so far, but I want us to talk about it, that thousands of children have been injureby products that you dinot believe were defective, that you dinot believe needeto be changed.	N
I do have serious reservations because of the reasons I have just stated, but I look forwarto asking questions.	N
It is my privilege to introduce an outstanding Virginian from McLean, Fairfax County, Mary Sheila Gall, for your consideration.	N
I know you already have been considering her for Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as Chair.	N
I know many remarks, Senator Ensign anSenator McCain, have mentionesome of the things in here.	N
This is obviously a hearing on consumer protection anI want to make sure it is not witness protection needein this.	N
Listening to Senator McCain--excuse me--Senator Edwards, I think that you will finin Mary Sheila Gall somebody who does balance needs.	D
Yes, consumer protection needs to be an issue that clearly the government has a role in warning anmaking sure products are safe, anthen there is also obviously a parental responsibility.	N
You know, Virginia style peanuts, many of which are grown in North Carolina as well, are the best anthe largest peanuts.	N
But trying to promote those peanuts in Great Britain with KP Foods, they say, we have a hartime getting mothers to buy peanuts for their kids.	N
They say, well, there is a government warning label that we have to put on all these packages that says small children may choke on these contents, which makes mothers very worrieabout them giving their children peanuts.	N
The Virginia style peanuts grown in eastern North Carolina anVirginia, of course, being the biggest, are probably even more of a danger.	N
AnI said: You know, in the UniteStates our mothers anparents tell kids to chew their foobefore they swallow it.	N
But nevertheless, those warning labels enup having an impact on the export of our products.	N
But regardless of all that, that little instruction in British consumer protection harming young children, not being able to eat nutritious peanuts because of the fear of the warning label.	N
Ms. Gall receiveher bachelor's degree, Mr. Chairman, from Rosary Hill College in Buffalo, New York, and, more importantly, her master's degree in special education from OlDominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.	D
Let us try to address a couple of the issues that have been raised, Ms. Gall, in the time that I have.	N
The question has been raiseabout a letter to the editor of October 12, 1999, in which you referreto certain Commission activities as ``proclamations issueby this agency on behalf of the federal Nanny State.''	N
You have been criticizefor voting not to bring a rulemaking on bunk beentrapment hazards.	D
It has been saiyou relieon a legal technicality to avoiproviding needeprotection for children who were dying as a result of getting stuck in the bunk berailing.	D
I am very pleasethat Commissioner Moore is here today anwe appreciate you being here, Commissioner Moore, anthe rest of the staff.	N
AnI believe it was because you were not sure that baby bath seats were safer or less safe than not using one.	D
Do you have any answer yet to the question of whether drownings occur at a higher rate when baby bath seats are not used?	N
I do not want to break in line here, but I do have a statement I woullike to submit for the record, anI do want to say how pleaseI am to offer my support to Mary Sheila Gall.	N
I have known her for a long time anI appreciate the work she has done anthe service she has given to her country.	D
I also appreciate the kinof person she is as an individual anher work on things unrelateto her government service on issues such as adoption.	D
The fact that she has two adoptechildren is a side of her personality that people do not really see, so I wanteto mention that.	D
From the perioof 1990 to 1998 the Commission receivereports of 89 bunk bed-relatedeaths.	N
Of this number, 64 percent involveentrapment, 24 involvechildren being hung from the beds by objects such as clothing, bedding, anbelts, ananother 8 were falls from the beds.	N
CPSC's statistical survey founthat about 31,400 children were treatein emergency rooms for bunk bed-relateinjuries.	N
Now, although there was a voluntary standarin place, to which you have referred, the fielstaff visite55 retail outlets in 39 cities, examining 58 manufacturers' bunk bemodels, anthey made the following findings: Of the 58 models, 23 were founto be in noncompliance with the voluntary standard.	N
Five manufacturers were discovereto have significant entrapment hazards associatewith their products, three of whom, more than 50 percent, were clearly aware of their voluntary standard.	N
You said: ``Our statute provides that the `Commission shall not promulgate' a mandatory rule unless an existing voluntary standard: 1) `is not likely to result in elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury' or 2) is `not likely' to have `substantial compliance.' '' You then hung your decision, the sole dissenting vote, on the notion that you thought there was at least it appears, presumptive, of substantial compliance.	N
The law says ``it wouleliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addresseand''--not ``or''; ``and''--``is likely there will be substantial compliance.''	N
So your decision was baseon only substantial compliance when the staff in fact recommendethat children are dying, they are being seriously injurein high numbers in the presence of the voluntary standard, anthat evidence was sufficient because it was not accomplishing what the law said, doing away with the injury.	D
How do you justify, number one, misinterpreting the law; number two, ignoring the evidence of the Commission with respect to the injuries that were continuing to be committed?	N
Well, with all due respect, Ms. Gall, I am sorry to interrupt you, but you are not, in fact, answering my question.	N
Well, because for the following four reasons: because the staff said, number one, by making it mandatory it woulallow them to pursue civil penalties for violations; number two, it woulfacilitate the recall of defective beds; number three, it woulincrease compliance; annumber four, it woulprevent the importation of noncomplying beds by foreign manufacturers--all four of which things you coulnot do under the voluntary---- 	N
If two members of the Commission were prepareto move to mandatory anthe staff was saying overwhelmingly we are not protecting these children adequately, the voluntary standarhas not workeover 8 years, but you hung your hat on a substantial compliance concept, erroneously putting it into one segment of a two-part law.	N
Now, indeepercentages are statistics, but for the 10 percent, you can have 10 percent of a large number of people which is too many of our children being submitteto a particular risk.	N
What I want to make sure is that if you are Chair of this Commission that you are willing to at least investigate--I am not talking about what the remedy is--to at least investigate whether or not product shortcomings are part of the problem as well, because in three proceedings you saiyou woulnot even take the initial steps to investigate whether there are product shortcomings.	N
My seconquestion to you is woulyou approach your job differently if you are confirmeas Chair than you did, say, as a member?	N
Everybody has got a right to change, anI have certainly made changes on my views over the years.	N
But, I woullike to have you say for the recorwhether you are going to handle your position as Chair the way you handleyour assignment during your previous 10 years.	N
I only want to say, Ms. Gall, what troubles me is that when we create this balance between consumer use anproduct shortcoming, it still looks to me like your reaction is going to be to first blame the consumer rather than to initiate an effort to examine whether product shortcomings are part of this as well.	N
Having come angone, I am not sure what was being covered, but I think everything from car seats to bunk beds have been.	N
Let me ask you something that is maybe not in the various safety matters, but I was looking at your response to the seconquestion as far as the top three challenges facing the Commission.	N
The first one that you brought up was ``The Commission needs to improve consumer product safety by harmonizing international consumer product safety standards,'' anmore participation with the technical staff anso forth.	N
Then you get into ``leveraging of existing resources of government by strategic alliances with other government organizations that have an existing international presence.''	N
I was reading on the issues as far as international trade, anI reajust yesterday how there is actually some pretty goopositive comments coming out of Great Britain with the U.S. counterpart on having not just a NAFTA for North America, but having the Americas anEurope harmonizing trade, which woulbe beneficial, I think clearly beneficial to Americans, to be able to get our products into Europe.	N
There are some very gooproducts out of France anGermany anBritain anthe Netherlands, the Swiss, anAustria anelsewhere that we woullike as well.	N
Now, the key to that I think, in the event that there is that harmonization anthat we can get our products easily into Europe anEuropean countries can get their products into our country, clearly one of the things that they talkeabout is the safety standards.	N
You made that a number one priority, which I think is very goobecause it means jobs anopportunities for this country.	D
How do you see your agency or this agency or this Commission working with your European counterparts?	N
Where woulyou see any problems or where do you see--do you think that their regulations of consumer protection woulbe so difficult that we coulnot be able to agree with them, or do you see that as fairly easy, although with some negotiations, in harmonizing their safety standards with those of the UniteStates?	N
I think that what you will finin this area is that sometimes you will finthat the industry, wanting to enter say the European market or the Europeans wanting to enter our market, whether it is on tractors or chain saws or appliances or whatever it may be, they are going to agree to maybe a stricter standarbecause they just want to please everyone with it, but it is goofor business anit is goofor consumers as well.	N
So your voluntary approaches may have industry actually saying, here is what we want to do, which is maybe further than we may want to constrain them.	N
Ms. Gall, I am going to make a couple of comments anthen at the enI am going to ask a question about recalls anyour philosophy on that.	N
I want to pick up on what you saiabout an example you gave of a drunk mother--it coulbe a drunk mother or a drunk father--who puts a child, let us say, in a baby bath seat, walks downstairs and, to use your example, forgets about the chilanso on.	N
That chilshoulnot be punishebecause that poor little innocent has a neglectful parent, mother or father.	N
You have saito me privately, anyou repeat it today, you vote97 percent of the time with the other Commissioners.	D
Most of them are noncontroversial, Mr. Chairman, such as voting to publish a notice in the Federal Register, appoint staff, accept settlement agreements, or to commena company for taking certain actions.	N
You say that; on the other hand, you saiin your testimony before this very Committee in 1999 when you were up to be back on the Commission, quote, quote from you: ``The other Commissioners anI do not always agree.	N
Sometimes you do not agree with them annow you say you agree with them, anI am very, very troubleby this conflict.	N
I want to talk to you about this education campaign that the Commission embarkeupon to let parents know that if they do take a chilinto bewith them there are certain risks.	N
It just let parents know that there are 64 deaths every year from suffocation anstrangulation when this occurs.	N
Now, clearly it is up to a parent, but I founthat to be important for parents to think about.	N
You coulroll over on a child, the chilcoulslip down between the mattress anthe guarrail.	N
In which you wrote, among other things, anlet me quote it directly: ``Infant sleeping study, a case of agency's overreaching.''	N
You wrote, anI am just quoting because of time a couple of the things: ``Frankly, as the only current Republican member on the commission''--which I find--I dinot think we think of ourselves when we are on a commission, but fine--``it has been increasingly frustrating''--your service on the Commission--``in recent years to witness the processing of proclamations issueby this agency on behalf of the federal Nanny State.''	N
 staffers for their initiative, I voteagainst proclaiming this to be an official CPSC study.''--in	N
You say: ``The only peril I can detect in this particular episode is over-reaching by a federal regulatory agency.''	N
Well, that is incredible to me when you look at the fact that there are 64 deaths each year, but the only peril you see is overreaching.	D
I am a believer that information is very, very important, anI worry because, again, being on the Commission is one thing; being the Chair, you impact the staff, you have tremendous influence over the staff.	N
I worry about a chilling effect on the staff when they are tolnot to give information to the public.	N
Now, obviously people will make that decision, but you know, a breast-feeding mother might just say: I never thought of that, so I am going to bring my baby into bewith me anwhen I am done I am going to change that baby's diaper anput her back into her crib that has safety standards, anmaybe that woulin fact save lives--64 kids a year.	N
So it greatly troubles me that not only woulyou oppose the Commission informing parents, but you go so far as to write an op-epiece mentioning that you were the only Republican anyou are worrieabout the direction of the Commission.	D
please correct me if I am wrong--that the way a recall works is the staff will recommena recall anthey will sit down with the product, the maker of the product, the manufacturer, antogether they will come to some conclusion about a recall; is that correct?	N
Well, I haheara tape of one of these discussions with the Commission, Mr. Chairman, where you, Ms. Gall, are talking about a baby walker.	N
It involvethe Safety First baby walker, where children were getting their teeth caught in a seam on the handle of the baby walker.	N
What woulhappen is they woulput their teeth down anliterally their teeth woulpop out anthey woullose their teeth on this ``Safety First'' baby walker.	N
I was listening to your questions anI was frankly stunned, because your line of questioning was, anI am quoting directly from your question: ``The teeth we are talking about are baby teeth, right?	N
In other words, your whole approach to it was to sort of belittle the fact that these kids were losing their teeth, anwe know that in fact if baby teeth are lost prematurely it impacts on the speech development of the chilanall the rest.	N
My time has run out, so we can either ask you to responto that baby teeth question or we can wait until the next round, Mr. Chairman.	N
You have correctethe recorin a lot of instances in today's hearing anI think you are acquitting yourself quite well.	N
As a grandmother of five, I want to compliment you on the vote to rescinthe infant sleepwear rule requiring that pajamas be flame-resistant antherefore polyester.	N
Our grandchildren have sufferefrom heat anhave not worn pajamas at all because they are so hot in the summertime because they coulnot be all cotton.	N
I know that that has been twisteanmade you to look like you were not for the flame-retardant safety.	N
You have, in fact, been able to look into it, get the facts, andetermine that actually the flame-resistant sleepwear dinot make that much of a difference.	N
I appreciate your willingness to stanup, ana lot of mothers angrandmothers in the southern States especially appreciate it in the summertime when they want cotton next to their children's bodies, not polyester.	N
Diyou want to elaborate on your reasoning behinthat anclarify what I think has been a distortion of your recoron that point?	N
I just want to ask if you think common sense plays a role when you are in a regulatory position anwhere you woulapply the common sense, as I think you diin this particular instance?	N
Are there places where you think common sense shoulbe more a part of the regulatory processes that you as Chairman, if you are confirmed, woulbe able to affect?	N
My question to you is directly--I know we can cite examples, but I have given you two examples where some woulargue that the redesign of a product can take into account the improper use of that product, anit is not going to be adequately supervised, that people are going to misuse the product.	N
Your position has been in those two cases that you feel that if the negligent use of the product causethe accident, we shoulnot consider redesigning those products.	N
He made reference specifically to your dissenting vote against issuing a Federal safety standarfor bunk beds.	D
The two of you talkeabout two components in the law that are necessary in order to finthat a voluntary standaris adequate.	N
The voluntary standarfor bunk beds habeen in place since 1992, I believe; is that correct?	N
The two requirements in the law, one of which you made reference to when you made your decision, was--	N
it is actually the seconrequirement--that there be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.	N
Some woulargue that 630,000 recalls over the course of 7 or 8 years is not substantial compliance.	N
But, I want to focus on the first requirement, which is that you have to finthat the voluntary standarwouleliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury.	N
My question to you is, diyou finin making that decision anrendering that vote that there habeen adequate compliance, number one; annumber two, that the voluntary standareliminateor adequately reducethe risk, even in the face of 50 some ochildren dying while the voluntary standarwas in place?	N
If children were dying during that perioof time, whatever the number is, anmaybe we coulargue about that, but whatever the number is, if children diewhile the voluntary standarwas in place--anin fact by 1999 it habeen in place for 7 years--if children dieduring that perioof time, from your perspective dithat voluntary standareliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury?	N
Are you saying that all those children who diewho fell in the categories you just talkeabout--none of the children who diewoulin fact have been covereby the standard?	N
For example, sitting two rows behinyou is Lyn Starks, who lost her daughter, I think in 1997, her 3 year olchilin 1997, 5 years after this voluntary standarhabeen put in place.	N
Woulyou say to her that this standaradequately protecteher daughter from the risk of injury, excuse me, from this bunk bed?	N
Two of your colleagues apparently thought that it was important to have a mandatory standard.	N
They laiout the fact that 89 deaths haoccurred, 57 by entrapment, that Ms. Starks halost her chilin 1997, her 3 year oldaughter, 5 years after a voluntary standarhabeen put in place.	N
One of the responsibilities of the Commission is you have authority over whether or not to pursue legal action against companies that manufacture defective products, correct?	N
I want to ask you about an area that I do not think you have been askeabout before, which is sprinklers, sprinklers to avoifires, put out fires, sprinklers in homes, dormitories, hospitals, that sort of thing.	N
You opposethe filing of an administrative complaint, anI think you alone opposeit, against the sprinkler company that habeen founto be manufacturing sprinklers that dinot operate properly.	N
They were in homes; they were in schools; they were in hospitals; they were in dormitories.	N
The result of the complaint, I think, was a resolution where a huge number of these defective sprinklers were recalled.	N
However, you were the sole dissenting vote against the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action against a company that hamanufacturesprinklers, put them in homes, hospitals, dormitories, all over this country.	D
But, in fact, in this case there was, as a specific result of the action being fileby the Commission, which you opposed, there was a specific resolution recalling all of these defective sprinklers.	N
In the mean time, if you dinot take legal action anyou were just engaging in discussion, these sprinklers stay in place, these defective sprinklers stay in place, anthe risk of families, students, anpatients in hospitals being hurt as the result of a fire continues, does it not?	N
Is it your view that there are businesses out there that sell anrun, that are flim-flam operations?	N
That is why we have criminal laws to go after those with criminal intent, anthose things are ongoing.	N
But it is your experience that most in business are trying to produce products that are safe, affordable, anthat serve their purpose, anthey want to sell the American consumer not one day, but every day if they can?	N
I wonder if you can tell me, because I am new to this Committee, what difference will there be in your role as a member of the Commission, which I understanyou will continue to be whether or not confirmeto be the Chairman or not.	N
What different role woulyou have, what influence change woulyou have, if you were the chair?	N
I think what every Senator who is going to vote on your confirmation is really struggling with is do you have a different thresholthan other members of the Commission for when, or burden of proof, if you will, for when you regulate or when you resort to voluntary.	D
I askeyour staff to provide us with examples of deaths of elderly Floridians particularly that were occasioneby space heaters another kinds of unfortunate accidents.	N
I woullike for you to talk to us a little bit about how you woulpropose to deal with a vulnerable population like the elderly.	N
What woulyou propose with regarto minority populations of elderly, where there is a language barrier?	N
I have sat here anlisteneto the dialog this morning, anwhat a novel thing it is to have a person up that has 10 years experience with the Commission anstill has a sense of humor.	D
How novel it is to have product knowledge anunderstanthe human being anstill approach it with a common sense type thing of trying to solve problems without going into court.	N
I think there have been some examples here that have been pretty far-reaching this morning.	N
After listening--I sat here just to listen this morning more than to ask question, to be right honest with you, because I am not real sure after hearing all this that I could--we dinot have bath seats for kids.	N
But I know that I guess when we lost our daughter when she was 15 years olanwe haan unfortunate accident, I guess I coulgo through a lot of things anprobably blame somebody else.	N
I know there are going to be three votes on that Commission anthe desires of the Commission I woulimagine will be seen by a majority of two to one.	N
But nonetheless, I am going to support this, anyour answers, anjust to keep approaching these problems under a common sense approach.	N
So I appreciate all the questions that everybody else askeanI am going to take that into consideration.	N
But I appreciate your positive attitude, approach to some very serious problems we have in product safety.	D
You know, I sat on the boarof directors at one time of the Shriners Hospitals for Children.	N
No other organization in the worlhas done more research on burns than that organization.	N
When we lookeat different circumstances that caused, after we dealt with it, what causethis thing anfire anfire retardants anthis type thing, we finally came to the conclusion sometimes the fire retardant wear dimore damage under certain circumstances than, say, just straight cotton in what we slept in as kids.	N
I just want to emphasize on my little minute here that we startewith Love Canal anall the toxic fumes andisease andeath that that causeup there in Buffalo, anwe institutethe Environmental Protection Administration, anthat savea lot of law cases.	N
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has savea lot of law cases as well as lives aninjury.	N
While I have workefor some 34, almost 35, years now in the cancer field, it was not Dr. Koop anDr. Kessler.	N
Now, when I go to the tobacco-growing area of Florence, South Carolina, in the courthouse they have got no smoking.	N
But, it was not until we really brought that case angot that settlement that people understoothe dangers of smoking.	N
I appreciate your having a seconround, Mr. Chairman, because this is really a signal today about how the Administration is going to handle consumer protection issues and, frankly, I am very troubleabout what we have hearin the last couple of hours.	N
When I anmy colleagues have given you these examples of these cases where you essentially saiit was the consumer's fault, your response has essentially been to cite extreme cases of individual irresponsibility.	N
excuse me, drunk parents this morning, anit seems to me that you are overlooking the significant role that the product is going to play in the vast majority of mainstream cases where the consumer has behaveresponsibly.	N
But just so we are clear now, anI woullike you to responto the question, that is not what your recorshows.	N
Your recorshows that you will not even begin the inquiry, anyou cite this question of extreme irresponsibility for not beginning the inquiry.	D
Coulyou give some examples in the last 10 years where you opposean industry position that industry felt strongly about?	N
But the witness has saithat in 10 years at the Consumer Product Safety Commission she voteagainst industry in one instance.	D
I want to wrap up with this, Mr. Chairman, because I think this is right at the heart of the question.	N
What has troubleme the most about what you have saitoday anin the past is that when you will not even initiate an inquiry in most instances you cannot get industries to the table in order to start looking for these kinof practical solutions.	D
Yet, when we try to educate parents about placing their children in adult beds, you not only oppose it, but you write a letter to the editor anyou condemn the Commission staff.	D
I think it is important that my daughter knows of this problem, anshe can make her own choice on how she wants to deal with it.	N
You can have an opinion, but then you write an op-epiece striking out at the staff for what they did, saying the only issue here was overreaching.	N
I simply think these inconsistencies are very, very troubling, anI do not believe that you will educate the elderly because you dinot want to educate the kids or even a grandma who might take her grandchilinto bewhen there is an infant involved.	D
Now, you then say, in response to Senator Edwards' questions about the sprinkler, oh, you dinot want to take that issue on because it takes too long.	D
So your point that, oh, when you issue a complaint it takes a lot of time, is disproveby the facts.	N
I think, Mr. Chairman, we have a witness here who is recasting herself ansaying, well, 97 percent I votewith the Commission, I only votetwice against administrative actions, complaints, when in fact there were only 3 in the last 8 years, to make us believe that she is in the mainstream.	N
Now, we got this information from the Commission staff, that there were only 3 in the last 8 years.	N
You voteagainst a rule for baby walkers because caregivers were failing to provide ``adequate supervision.''	D
We have gone over that, anI have tolyou I agree we want to give adequate supervision to our children; but a childoes not choose its parents anif there is a real problem anthe parent does not supervise, we want the safest products possible for the child, to protect the child.	N
You know, with the bunk beds you saithe parents shoulnot put the kids in the upper bunk.	N
As a result, you voteagainst a rule for baby walkers anyet the injuries droppe60 percent in 5 years as a result of the redesign.	N
Mr. Chairman, anyone who knows anything knows the reason industry sat down was because of that rulemaking.	N
We have the safest products in the worlbecause we have people who serve on these commissions who care, who are fiercely fighting.	N
Anwhen they slack off, we do have trial lawyers what come in, much maligneas they are.	N
We have the safest products in the worlbecause we have a system that protects consumers.	N
If we have the heaof the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Mr. Chairman, who is anything less than vigilant ana fighter anan advocate--Ms.	N
But to make you the heaof this Commission, it seems to me to be wrong, because we neea fighter.	N
We neesomeone who is going to get out there anadvocate, not someone who says, well, the rulemaking hanothing the do with the fact that the people came to the table.	N
Knowing that 11,600 kids each year--let me correct that--11,300 injuries to babies have been avoided, woulyou still vote against that rulemaking?	N
But, I want to point out that as of this point in a direct question, Ms. Gall refuseto answer woulshe cast the same vote.	N
Because the other Commissioners hathe guts to say that 11,300 injuries a year to babies is too much to take.	N
What troubles me tremendously is the fact that you voteagainst agency action on the bath seats, again claiming negligent parents.	N
While your primary reason for opposing the rule was to defer to voluntary standards, which hanot worked, anthe recorwill show that, you also voiceyour views that the real cause of death was the parents inappropriately placing children under 4 years olin the upper bunks.	D
I do not want to do anything on my watch that is going to punish children because they cannot reathe warnings or is going to punish elderly people because maybe they are not as swift as they once habeen.	N
I think, if anything, we can see here that, while someone may provide a balance on a commission as a commissioner--anI do not question your integrity in any way.	N
You believe that industry shoulfix itself, you believe that parents are to blame, anthat is what you believe anyou have a right to believe it.	D
You do not believe in doing what it takes to make products safe, anyou woulrather let it go to industry to deal with it.	N
I think that is a problem when considering your nomination to be the Chairman of a commission whose mission is making products as safe as they can be.	N
Let me first thank our regular Chairman, Senator McCain, for his leadership, in showing that a 50/50 divideSenate can work together as a unit.	N
Anour regular Chairman has been outgoing in wanting to move things along anget things done.	N
It is not to get into partisan struggle to see who is on top anwho can get the most publicity.	N
First, we do not have the Office of Government Ethics report from the financial statement you submitted.	D
Anit coulbe that some of the predictive Members on both sides who have yet to be announcenext week woulwant to be able to meet with you, Mr. Evans, anask some questions, particularly about the census.	N
Anwe will finthen if Chairman McCain at that time in the week of January 22 wants to hola further hearing before we move to confirmation in this Committee.	N
Before yielding to Chairman McCain as mentioned, I have cut my opening statement down to respect our time limits anbecause I have hathe opportunity to meet with Mr. Evans to go over the matter of manufacturing.	N
Anthere is one other thing that we dinot get to touch upon that I ought to cover here in an opening statement.	N
But be that as it may, we have got a wonderful happening down there in Vincente Fox's election.	N
Anrather than to pass through money anthe Wall Street bankers operating the policy towarMexico, we can develop, as President Fox has indicated, a common market.	N
They taxethemselves some $5 billion before they alloweGreece anPortugal to come into the Common Market.	N
You've got to have not only free elections, but labor rights, property rights, a respectejudiciary.	N
Rather than sending money down to go back to Wall Street, which has been the case over the many years, we want to help builthat infrastructure anreally solve that immigration, solve that drug problem, anbring up their economy so that it is relatively competitive with ours.	N
So I want to make sure that we not only enforce our trade laws, but we make sure that they work.	N
It is just an outpouring of manufacturing jobs down there because we as politicians at this particular level say ``Before we open up Evans manufacturing, you have got to have clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing, parental leave, safe working place, safe machinery.''	N
All of that goes into the cost of production, anthey do not even have a goominimum wage down there.	N
I want to thank you for your continuecooperation, including holding this confirmation hearing.	N
I think it is both significant antraditional on your part that you woulagree to holthis hearing at this early time.	D
I woulalso like to mention that I was thinking this morning this begins our fifth year of working together.	N
I appreciate that very much, anI look forwarto the opportunity in the next 2 years of working together as we have in the past.	N
In his acceptance remarks following the President's nomination, Mr. Evans laiout his vision anpriorities for the Commerce Department.	N
They include the promotion of free enterprise, first in America anthen abroad, the free flow of capital, anfree anopen competition.	N
At the outset, I want to applauwhat I take to be Mr. Evans' emphasis on free anfair trade.	D
The rapirise of the Internet is just one of the more recent factors that makes a global economy an undeniable reality.	N
Erecting anenforcing trade barriers between anamong individual countries is simply the wrong policy to pursue.	N
Establisheprocedures, rather than retaliatory trade actions, are available to ensure trade is fair.	N
Turning to the Department's responsibility for the census, we all know that the issue of statistical sampling is controversial, anhas been deemeunconstitutional strictly for census counting purposes.	N
This issue is important to me as well as many other Members of the Committee because traditional counting methods do not provide an accurate count of the population in my home State of Arizona, anArizona citizens have suffereas a result.	N
I look forwarto Mr. Evans' comments on his plans to ensure an accurate census count, especially in those locations where there have been documenteundercounts in the past.	D
I believe that one of the most important missions of the Commerce Department is to remain politically neutral.	N
Commerce Secretaries Daley anMineta made great strides in reducing the political emphasis of the Department.	N
Mr. Evans, I hope anexpect that you will strive to continue animprove upon their efforts.	D
Charges include allegations that seats on foreign trade missions were ``sold'' to major donors, anthat Commerce Department officials were directly involvein political fundraising.	N
Mr. Evans, your vigilance will be essential to ensure that the Department remains true to its publicly statemission, rather than an agenda that merely promotes political interests.	D
Your business experience speaks for itself as you face the challenging management task aheaof you.	D
I am going to endorse the statements made by our two chairmen here this morning, anwelcome you to the Committee.	N
But I first want to thank both you anSenator McCain for setting a terrific example for the Senate.	N
AnI appreciate the fact that this Committee is meeting today in a way that I hope paves the way for people to understand, particularly when you look at the last years of recorof this Committee, how effective bipartisanship cooperation can be.	N
AnI think it shows that no one has anything to fear from some of the proposals that are on the table for our cooperative effort.	N
Anby the way, over the holidays, from your remarks, I haan opportunity to drive through South Carolina anNorth Carolina.	N
AnI am delighteon this appointment, by the way, anour visit with Mr. Evans anto welcome him here this morning.	N
We realize that public service is sometimes not too keenly sought after among successful people that we neeto get into government anthey bring a certain amount of expertise to government that we certainly need.	N
commerce anthe information age, those new technologies do not recognize national or international borders.	N
So the NTIA is a very important part of the Commerce Department, anhow we foresee new technologies into areas where the majority of Americans can take advantage of those.	N
Also, an important area that I just want to bring to your attention is the National Institute of Standards anTechnology (NIST).	N
NIST is sometimes overlooked, anI woullike to recognizethat institution up the roahere in Maryland.	N
Anfrom Eureka, Montana to Alzada, Montana, flying like a crow flies, maybe a little straighter, it is further than it is from Chicago to Washington, D.C.	N
That is the lanmass anyou understanlanmass as far as the State is concerneanso does my frienhere on my right.	N
So whenever we talk about recognizing population anthe representation in this Congress, I think I have got a pretty gooargument.	N
AnI founyou, frankly, even on first meeting, to be very direct, very candid, very pragmatic.	D
Let me just make three quick points which we discussed, anone of which I will ask a further question on.	N
It is not impossible that very shortly about 50 percent of the steel industry in the UniteStates will be in bankruptcy or in financial comparable status.	N
Vice President-elect Dick Cheney came to Weirton, West Virginia, ansaithat there coulnot be a defense industry without a steel industry.	N
I just neeto say that even though it may create tensions within the administration, there really is, in terms of the steel industry, a neefor the Bush Administration to intervene quickly.	N
But this is a genuine, genuine crisis for the industry anfor all of the people that work within it.	N
Second, there are three quick technology issues, one of which Senator ConraBurns, my goofriend, has already mentioned.	N
The first I woulmention woulbe the question of the digital divide which has almost become a cliche, but which is becoming in my judgment not only a severe, more severe, problem, even as we work to expanour technology infrastructure within States, within the country, anobviously even more dramatically, within the world.	N
Also, there is an interesting program callethe TOP program which is the Technology Opportunities Program.	N
Hardly anybody has hearof it, but it makes an enormous difference to States anto regions which woulotherwise be under-servein a very dramatic way.	N
Anthird, something we discusseyesterday, the EPSCOT program, which is the technology equivalent of taking not just University of Texas where you graduatefrom, in other words, the first tier universities--excuse me, Senator Gramm--among others, anthe Stanfords anthe Harvards, et cetera.	N
But going to first-rate, seconlevel universities where first-rate research is being done by first-	N
AnI think it represents one of the truly important challenges for you anfor your department anfor the country's success as you go into your new job.	N
Very finally, another rather obscure program, but we have to protect our information infrastructure.	N
Anyou have within your Bureau of Export Administration a program callethe Critical Infrastructure Assurance office.	N
Having saithat, I do not want people to come back here in 5 years with us in shambles in this whole area anasking why it was that we dinot do something when we have the ability within your department to take action on that.	N
I think your qualifications will give you an opportunity to excel in this particular role.	D
But I do want to say that I am very interestein the issues of technology, the NTIA, the work it is doing, third-generation wireless.	N
There are so many interesting ancritically important things that are being done in these areas.	N
AnI want to mention that Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, anmyself authorelegislation that createa trade deficit review commission.	N
Anone of the things I saiis we neeto devote more resources to monitoring compliance with trade agreements.	N
The President shoulrequest more resources for Commerce's market access ancompliance unit.	N
You know how many people over in Commerce are involvein monitoring our trade relationship with China with respect to enforcement?	N
The largest trade deficit--the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country angrowing rapidly.	N
I will not continue further except to say a number of our colleagues have talkeabout this anit is very important.	N
Anas you come to this job anthis opportunity, I know you will pay some attention to it from our discussion yesterday.	N
Again, thank you for being willing to serve our country anI look forwarto supporting your nomination.	N
May I just say what a pleasure it is to be here with Mr. Evans anour distinguishecolleagues from the great state of Texas.	N
I feel that this hearing is a harbinger of goothings to come anbipartisan cooperation on behalf of our country anbehalf of our federal government.	N
AnI too want to join my colleagues here today in welcoming you, Mr. Evans, to this Committee anto congratulate you as well on your nomination as Secretary of Commerce by President-elect Bush.	N
I also want to say you are in goocompany here today with our colleagues Senator Gramm anSenator Hutchison.	N
It is certainly clear from your backgrounanyour experience that you bring a broarange anexpertise to the position for which you have been selected.	N
As others have indicatehere today, the Department of Commerce has a broarange of jurisdiction among a number of agencies.	N
There is every indication that you possess the credentials anthe knowledge anthe expertise that is consistent with the post.	D
We neeto have an individual who has clear vision, innovative ideas anskill anadministrative abilities.	N
I think that you will be a tremendous asset to the Commerce Department efforts in export promotion which is key to providing a strong competitive environment in which our businesses can thrive.	D
I believe small anlarge businesses must have the opportunities to export abroato maintain a strong economy.	N
Others, particularly Senator Dorgan, have talkeabout being vigilant about unfair trade practices.	N
Certainly, it is a concern to have the estimate$440 billion trade deficit which we incurrelast year.	N
This unprecedentedeficit mentioneby Senator Dorgan underscores the Federal Trade Deficit Review Commission finding that long-term trade deficits are not sustainable or desirable for the long term.	N
Anthat is certainly something that we have to be mindful of with the passage anthe ratification of the trade agreement with China.	N
We have to be vigilant in China's compliance anenforcement with WTO agreements without any question.	N
AnI woulencourage you, as I was discussing with you yesterday in our meeting, to seek anfill the position that was proposeby the Clinton Administration last year with respect to having a deputy secretary at the Commerce Department to monitor China's compliance with WTO agreements, especially for import-sensitive businesses like textiles anapparel that have been devastatein my State anthe State of the Chairman of this Committee over the last decade.	N
I think it is all the more important that we have a responsibility--indeean obligation--to strongly enforce the principles of these agreements to make sure that their enof the bargain is being upheld.	N
As Chair of the Ocean anFisheries Subcommittee, I also woulcall your attention to our nation's fisheries.	N
I guess I do not have to reminyou, given the coastal State that you come from, Mr. Evans, anour colleagues.	N
But our nation's fisheries are an invaluable resource, certainly to my State as well anto this country.	N
We have seen the value of those resources increase by more than 11 percent last year alone.	N
I woulhave to say my biggest concern is in holding regulatory agencies accountable for the regulatory decisions they make.	N
In this instance, as we prepare to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act which is the primary law governing our nation's fisheries, we have to make sure that we have the gooscience to back up those regulatory decisions.	N
I conductesix hearings across this country last year, anthe major complaint that I hearfrom the wide range of stakeholders is that the agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, faileto provide the kinof science to back up anto reinforce the strong regulatory action that they were taking.	N
Also what is disturbing is the trentowarlitigation driving the agency's decisions because of the lack of gooscience.	N
So this transition to sustainable fisheries has been a difficult one that has really culminatein a never-ending morass of regulations upon regulations.	N
To cite an example, the New Englangroundfishing industry--as Senator Kerry woulalso acknowledge--has facemore changes than one coulcount.	N
AnI hope that with your backgrounanexperience that you woulbe able to leathat change in improving the management of that agency as well as the overall fishing industry.	D
That is a very important program to many areas of the country, including the State of Maine.	N
AnI hope that you will continue to sustain that agency, to help revitalize areas of the country that have been bypassein this unprecedenteera of economic growth.	D
Anfinally, on the technology issue, I too want to underscore the importance of the Technology Opportunities Program that is within the National Telecommunications anInformation Administration, because it is important to revitalizing anrejuvenating areas of the country that have not experiencestrong economic growth anwho are apt to be left behinin this information revolution.	N
AnI am certain that in your hands we will be able to succeeanthrive anflourish in Hawaii.	D
The Committee is pleaseto have our distinguishecolleagues Senator Gramm anSenator Hutchison to present the nominee.	N
Mr. Chairman anMembers of the Commerce Committee, let me thank you for having this early hearing.	N
It is a great privilege for me to be here today to introduce my fellow Texan anmy friend, DonalL. Evans anto introduce you to him as the President's nominee for Secretary of Commerce.	N
Don Evans has serveas Chairman of the BoaranCEO of a major oil angas exploration company with a billion dollars of private assets.	D
Few candidates for Secretary of Commerce have ever brought the rich anlengthy experience in the private sector of the economy to this job that Don Evans brings.	D
I think as an indication of his ability as a manager, he became CEO of a billion dollar company when he was 33 years old.	D
He has serveour State in many positions of leadership, certainly one of the most important is Chairman of the Boarof Regents of the University of Texas which is a huge concern, 80,000 staff members, $6 billion budget.	D
But he has servewith great distinction as Chairman of the Boarof Regents of the University of Texas.	D
He was the driving force behinNative Vision, which is a program to assist Native American children.	D
Anthat program, which is largely his creation, now provides services to some 10,000 Native American children in America.	D
He is a graduate of the University of Texas in mechanical engineering which is one of their most outstanding programs at the university.	D
AnI think the happy condition we are in today is finding ourselves where through our action in the Senate we can put Don Evans on America's side as Secretary of Commerce.	N
AnI very strongly recommento this distinguisheCommittee that Don Evans be reportefavorably anconfirmeby the Senate.	N
AnI want to thank you anSenator McCain for working together to have this early hearing so that we can get an early confirmation.	N
Anhe said, ``Well, if you coulreminme of every place I livewhen I went to the University of Texas.''	N
I want to say that I am particularly pleasethat our President-elect has chosen someone who is a true entrepreneur, someone who knows the ups andowns of business.	D
Because this is a man who knows first-hanwhat the businesses of our country go through when we have economic swings as we are seeing today.	D
But mostly he will understanwhat they are going through anhow we can level out those peaks anvalleys.	D
Second, from a non-credible source, an Aggie, no less, you have hearof his service to the University of Texas.	D
But in fact, I am also an alum of the University of Texas anvery prouthat he has helthe very highest position of leadership in our mutual university anthat he serves as Chairman of the Boarof Regents.	D
Senator Rockefeller, you were talking about the importance of research anbringing fledgling researchers up through our system in America, that was one of the great strengths of Don Evans' service as Chairman of the University of Texas Boarof Regents.	D
He focuseon research anincreasethe opportunities for our young researchers at the University of Texas throughout the system because he too felt that that was so important.	D
So I have a feeling that research is going to be one of the important priorities that he will bring to the Commerce Department.	D
I do not neeto go back through his resume because I think Senator Gramm has given you that.	N
But I will just say that I am very prouthat this Texan has been chosen to leathe Department of Commerce.	D
AnI do hope that our Committee will confirm him quickly so that he can represent the best that is America in our free enterprise system to the world.	N
When you talk about trade it cannot be a one-way street with the opportunity to export, but that is not our problem.	N
You reminme of that Small Business Administration questionnaire that went out some years ago, Mr. Evans.	N
I take almost everything I produce for General Electric in Greenville anthe Dozer turbines down in Florence where we are making the magnetic resonance images.	N
What we really neeis a change of mindset to get away from the foreign trade as foreign aid.	N
If we make a finding in favor, then we are going to run up the price of gasoline during an election year.''	N
So they buckeit up to the Court of International Trade on a technology issue about standing.	N
But I want to give you that as an example because the Zenith case, the entire Cabinet after a 3-year trial ana Supreme Court finding aneverything else of that kind, with President Reagan, the Cabinet havoteto go aheaanenforce the finding.	N
So America's industry says ``the heck with these trade lawyers anspending 3 years anmillions of dollars in court.	N
Anso before you can produce the Boeing 777 or sell it in the People's Republic, they say you have got to produce half of it in downtown Shanghai.	N
You pick up Monday's Wall Street Journal anit says we are going to try to compete now with the 747 super-duper 747.	N
The Europeans do not have one, but the AirBus crowis now trying to go to 600 passengers.	N
Not the crazies that came out of Oregon--excuse me, Ron--that trieto break up Main Street there in Seattle, you know, that crowthat came.	N
That is why we pleawith you to please take over so that we have got a proper, not just--we do not neea sheriff or chief of police to enforce.	N
Everybody else uses their market to promote the interests of their manufacturer, anwe have got to start doing the same.	N
Before you become a nation state, you have got to produce the steel for the weapons of war anthe tools of industry.''	N
Anthen we come back to our workers ansteel plants here ansay, ``Oh, you have got to compete.	N
That is what you appearebefore the group, International Trade Commission, anmade an eloquent statement about that need.	N
With respect to fisheries that Senator Snowe anSenator Kerry pointeout, we actually hato holup an almost continuing resolution ancoulnot adjourn just before Christmas on account of a fisheries case--the sea lions up in Alaska.	N
Anwe hanot gotten the right science to feeinto the right court finding to protect those fisherman up there in Alaska.	N
So a little thing--all for the want of a horseshoe nail--a little thing in your department becomes an almost super important matter here on the Hill itself.	N
I note the presence of Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn from the State of Washington, who is here in support of our nominee anwe thank you for being here, Congresswoman Dunn.	N
One of your responses to the pre-hearing questionnaire states that Tom Brown, Incorporatehas been involvein various State anFederal administrative agency proceedings in the normal course of this business.	N
Coulyou clarify what proceedings Tom Brown, Incorporatewas involvein antheir disposition?	N
Andiany of these proceedings involve damages or civil penalties paito the government or to thirparties anyour involvement there.	N
There have been numerous reports in the past that the Department of Commerce trade missions have involveexplicit animplicit fundraising activities or requests.	N
There have also been allegations that there may have existea quipro quo involving campaign contributions in return for being involvein or inviteon such missions.	N
Without passing judgment on the veracity of these reports, I woullike to know what actions you intento take to ensure that such activity does not occur in the future.	N
Woulyou for the recorsubmit to this Committee no later than 30 days from now in writing your plan to ensure that electoral politics do not play a role in the Department of Commerce programs antrade missions?	N
Well, I appreciate the priority that you are putting on it anparticularly that you woulwork with all of the others involveto try to set a policy that everyone has a part in developing anthen letting everyone know what that policy is.	D
The only other comment that I woulmake, anI think that you have seen the diversity of issues with which you are going to have to deal from the opening statements of Members.	N
I wouljust say that I think the President-elect's focus on an energy policy in the very near term is well placed.	D
AnI hope that you as Secretary of Commerce ansomeone who understands this business will be helpful in formulating an energy policy that not only is goofor the short-term anthe help that is needein the short-term to stabilize prices, but also for the long term.	D
We must have conservation anproduction in our own country if we are going to control the stability of our own oil resources.	N
So I hope that with the Secretary of Energy, with the Secretary of Interior anwith the President-elect, you will be a part of a process that will give us an energy policy really for the first time in this country that will value all of those elements anput us on the right course for having better control of our own destiny as it relates to energy.	D
Anwith that, I will just say that you know I am going to support you anI am very pleasethat you are here.	N
Among those were about an undercount of approximately 8.4 million Hispanics, Asians anblacks.	N
The sampling back then founthat the decennial census undercounteNative Americans living on reservations at a rate of 15 times that of whites.	N
Anit also undercounteLatinos anblacks at a rate of 6 to 7 times the rate of whites, anAsians at a rate of 3 times that of whites.	N
Now, the experts in the Census Bureau have determinethat a statistical sampling process is a viable, scientifically sounmethoto ensure that those counts are accurate, anthat that woulprovide us with a single uniform standarby which we can count accurately our fellow Americans.	N
I woullike to know if the professionals in the Department were to recommento you as Commerce Secretary--anwe do not know this yet--but if they were to come to you ansay, Mr. Secretary, there is a baundercount here anwe have determinebaseon this scientific methodology that we neeto rectify that so that Americans are properly represented, your predecessor Mr. Mineta has, in fact, left in place a process that will allow them to do that.	N
Will you honor what Mr. Mineta has put in place and, in fact, follow the professional recommendation?	N
What I anothers are concerneabout is that it is left to professionals, that politics does not enter into it so that some recourse is sought that does not respect the rule that is in place.	N
I mean, is there any reason that you woulsee as you approach this job that woulmotivate you to suggest that you woulnot leave it to the Census Bureau?	N
Woulyou as a matter of your confirmation today guarantee to the Committee that if there were some reason that you thought that the rule Mr. Mineta put in place shoulnot be honorethat you woulcome back to the Committee anexplain to the Committee in an open session precisely what the rationale for changing that might be?	N
Last year at the WorlEconomic Forum, which is a gathering of significant business ancorporate interests from arounthe globe, a poll was taken of the leading businesspeople there.	N
Anoverwhelmingly, these corporate chiefs from arounthe planet agreethat one of the most serious issues, the most serious issue, that they felt they facein the long-term was the problem of global warming.	N
Paul O'Neil, who will be our new Treasury Secretary, has been a leader, in fact, among the corporate community in leading his company to proactively take steps to deal with this issue.	D
AnNOAA is our most important research entity, most important entity for climate change knowledge, science.	N
AnI wonder if you are familiar with the IPCC climate assessment anwhat your commitment woulbe with respect to that issue anthe leadership role the Commerce Department plays in it?	N
On the census, Mr. Evans, it is the Committee's hope that you will support President-elect Bush's supporting sampling anopposing hancounts.	D
In your position you are going into, Mr. Evans, now, this morning we hathe opportunity to visit with the appointee for the Secretary of Agriculture.	N
Anfoosafety, of course, is always an issue with the Department of Agriculture another departments.	N
You know, we have the most inefficient government in the world, but it is designethat way.	N
Anwith you coming in, what happens in the Department of Transportation anwhat happens in the Department of Energy anwhat happens in the Department of Agriculture effects a lot of things that happens in the Department of Commerce.	N
In other words, you have the ability to oversee or to look on what the policies of those agencies are, anhow it effects our commerce, our movement of trade, our everyday life.	N
I do not know how you set it up, but I woulcertainly like to see some sort of a little office off in the corner that is in charge of communicating or nourishing a relationship between departments because of these very sensitive areas.	N
I think the same challenges in order to make government work, we have to nourish those relationships between communications of what we do over in the Department of Labor.	N
Now, what we do in the Department of Energy anTransportation does effect our ability to foster economic opportunities for every American in this country.	N
Anyou know that unlike any other steel industry in the world, not one single dime of Federal money has gone into the productivity increases, the remodeling, the complete--whether it is environmental, furnaces, whatever, it has all been money which has been borroweor taken from profits anwhich can no longer be borrowefrom banks.	N
I indicateto you in my opening statement that about half of our steel industry, if two more go under, which I think they are going to, about half will be in bankruptcy.	N
But when Bethlehem is trading at about $1 stock, one really has to stanback ansay what is going on here?	N
Now, Italy produces steel--ansubstitute them for any other nation in the world--they have not made a profit in a generation or more.	N
Whatever the difference is at the enof the year, the government makes up that difference.	N
Anhence, the whole concept of making sure that import surges ananti-dumping circumvention laws are enforced.	N
I mean, people say that if you say something like that, you are a protectionist or that you are doing something which is regressive.	N
If the UniteStates were to make a decision, an inadvertent decision, by not making other decisions, to say, ``Oh, well, the Middle East has a lot of oil.	N
We import an enormous percentage of what we use in this country now because it is dumpeat lower prices than the cost of production in the home country.	N
Anas I indicateto you yesterday, Weirton Steel, which when we made it into an ESOP in 1982 ha13,000 people working for it.	N
If you want to ask Mr. Gore why he dinot carry the State of West Virginia, a large part of it woulcome arounto that anthe effect on the coal industry which feeds the steel industry in West Virginia.	N
Now, I do not want to inject politics into that, but it is a very graphic example of how angry our people are at the Export/Import Bank loan anthe way steel import surges anthe steel prices was not dealt with by the present administration, the Clinton Administration.	N
I go back to what Vice Present-elect Cheney said, that we have to have a steel industry to have a defense industry.	N
You cannot go to war in the Gulf or any other place ansay, ``Korea, coulyou lenus some steel so we can make some more whatever kinof armaments?''	N
One, that you woulin a sense make a commitment that you recognize that in the promotion of American industry that that also involves the promotion of keeping, as Chairman Hollings has indicated, that manufacturing base of which there can be no more important component than steel.	N
Second, that you woulagree with me that if this industry is, in fact, going to be saved, if we are not going to simply lose all of it, that the government--anthis is always a difficult decision.	N
On the other hand, clearly it dinot work with a Democratic government--has to somehow intervene to be helpful.	N
AnI hope that you woulsay to me that you woulbe willing to consider anperhaps promote not just sort of a generalizeintervention into this problem of your own intellect anenergy, but also take a very clear look at the Section 201 approach which wouldo more to stop import surges than anything else I can think of.	N
One of the things about commerce in the couple of years I have been on the Commerce Committee ancertainly the 4 years I have been in the Senate, that one has to realize as we move into the 21st century is the impact of e-commerce, the impact of technology on our society, the neefor technological workers.	N
In my own interest, I mentionethe products from my State that we sought to export, that we seek to finmarkets for abroad.	N
In all honesty, I finit fascinating that our country, our economy, has to import a lot of technological workers from abroato fill the 3- to 4-hundred-thousanhigh technology jobs out there that are going lacking for workers.	N
Which brings us to more maybe your role as Chairman of the Boarof Regents of a great university system anthat maybe the key to economic growth ancommerce, particularly e-	N
commerce, is growing our own high tech workers anproviding the kinof connectivity to the not only global marketplace, but through the Internet for all of our workers.	N
If President-elect Bush's goal is to leave no person behind, no community behind, is really to be fulfilled, which is our basic wish, it is obvious if you look at America, ancertainly my State, there are lot of people that are not connected.	N
I hela forum in South Georgia, rural Georgia, on the whole point of high tech workers anwhether or not rural America, rural Georgia, was connected, particularly via the Internet.	N
I founit interesting that in urban America, aneven the urban poor, are more connectevia the Internet than shall we say anyone, wealthy or poor, in rural America or in rural Georgia.	N
In the Commerce Department, there is something callethe Technology Opportunities Program, TOP, the TOP program, which provides infrastructure anInternet access to disadvantagecommunities.	N
Not particularly black, not particularly Hispanic, not particularly white or particularly wealthy or economically disadvantaged.	N
Anthe cost seems to be higher in rural America for that connectivity than if you were just living in say a suburban part--urban part of America.	N
Well, the point being this forum highlightefor me this little-known program that happens to be in your agency.	N
I wouljust like to know or to ask you to take a look at that as maybe an opportunity through that program to facilitate connectivity.	N
Anthrough continueinfrastructure anInternet access grants or help to disadvantagecommunities through these TOP grants.	N
In other words, continue to boost the American economy or the chance to participate in the global marketplace.	N
As you well know, some rural or poor or disableindividual sitting at home can through the Internet market goods abroaanin effect have a job, have a sales effort anso forth.	N
Technology Opportunities Program which provides infrastructure anInternet access to the disadvantagecommunities arounour country.	N
AnI will be looking at that as a way to hopefully expaneconomic development, e-commerce anaccess to the Internet from their point of view.	N
commerce anthe global marketplace that there is more anmore information to suggest that a certain portion of our culture, our economy, is being left behind.	N
Anto the extent to which we coulboost their chances for connectivity is the extent to which that rising tide coullift those boats too.	N
AnI appreciate your insight too into how both the private sector anthe academic sector, with maybe a little help from government as a catalyst, maybe can with all three partners in effect working together, a lot of goothings can happen.	N
Well, I hope you will get us a proposal on this promptly, because both Senator McCain anSenator Hollings spent a lot of time in discussions at the enof last year.	N
We feel we are pretty close anhave something that woulbe important for the entrepreneurs in the new economy that holso much promise anat the same time woulbe fair to the mayors anthe governors by saying if you have got a proposal, we will consider it.	N
Because in your emphasis in terms of free markets anfree enterprise, the key, of course, to free enterprise is for citizens to have confidence that they are being treatefairly.	N
We feel that you obviously neeto get the consent of the individual anthey ought to have access to their records anprovisions for security anenforcement.	N
Anagain, I know because this is all new to you, I wouljust like this morning to have you outline your general feelings about how you are going to approach this privacy issue.	N
Because I think Fritz Hollings anJohn McCain have done very goowork on these new economy issues over the last year or so.	N
Anwith your leadership, we coulon both of these issues--the Internet Tax Freedom bill anthe privacy issue--we coulget out of this Committee bipartisan legislation anput something on the President's desk that he woulfeel gooabout signing.	N
Their leaissue that they have right now is spectrum anavailability of spectrum to go into the next generation of wireless services.	N
So that I guess all of us can mindlessly be connecteall the time anywhere wherever we are.	N
That is going to be a major issue for you in the department is the allocation of spectrum for this next generation of wireless services.	N
I hope you will be open to providing the necessary spectrum so that that next level of connectivity over the Internet, wireless, video wireless, a whole series of innovations within that industry will move forward.	N
Because I think that issue is going to determine the future of that next generation of wireless services.	N
Because the decisions made today put in place what we can or cannot do for the next couple of decades, I think, in this whole industry.	N
It can aa level of comfort ancommunication to people that we have really only dreameof in the past.	N
But we coulalso limit it such that we will not be able to do it if we do not do it right.	N
So I appreciate your interest anyour thoughtfulness on it, because it is an issue that is out there.	N
Ana lot of times we spentime looking back on industries that we want to try to change.	N
A seconone that is somewhat similar is high speeInternet access, particularly in our less populateareas in the country.	N
We haa hearing in this Committee several months ago about access to high speeInternet, anfounthat in the suburban anurban areas, generally really in the suburban areas, there was as much as 70 percent penetration of high speeInternet access.	N
There are a series of bills that have been put forward, some subsidies, some deregulatory, some tax incentives, on trying to get more deployment of high speeInternet into less populateareas.	N
The approach I am supporting is a deregulatory approach towarit, but you woulasome real focus aneffort anintensity to this so the problem does not continue to grow anexacerbate ancause difficulty for economic activity another type of activities in rural areas.	N
The Members to be appointenext week have yet haan opportunity to confer or ask questions.	N
Whether or not that will require a further hearing, it will be up to our regular Chairman.	N
It is the Committee's hope that we can confirm you that first week after the inauguration.	N
I look forwarto the continueclose working relationship between our staffs, anI thank you again for holding this hearing on a very important position.	N
This Committee takes its advice anconsent role very seriously, anI will note that Mr. Kassinger has respondein detail to the Committee's request for biographical anfinancial data.	N
I have hathe opportunity to review your responses to the Committee's questionnaire anI look forwarto moving your nomination quickly along with the other nominations we have considerebefore the Committee yesterday.	N
Prior to Mr. Kassinger's appointment, he was a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, where he hapracticesince 1985.	D
From 1981 through 1985 Mr. Kassinger serveas International Trade Counsel to the Senate Committee on Finance under the leadership of Chairmen Bob Dole anBob Packwood.	D
Previously Mr. Kassinger serveas an attorney with the U.S. Department of State from 1980 to 1981 anthe U.S. International Trade Commission from 1978 to 1980.	D
Mr. Kassinger is currently serving the Department of Commerce as Senior Adviser to the Secretary.	D
I appreciate your willingness to serve, anif you have any family members here, please feel free to introduce them before you begin your remarks.	N
I know this is a very proumoment for all of you, especially your daughters, anwe want to welcome them.	N
I just want to say a few quick words regarding today's nomination of Mr. Kassinger anlater the testimony of Dr. Michael Adams, the distinguishePresident of the University of Georgia.	N
Mr. Kassinger has a distinguisherecorof public service, as an appointee in the Reagan Administration as well as his many years as a high-level staffer to Senator Bob Dole.	D
Mr. Kassinger is a prourecipient of both his undergraduate angraduate degrees from the University of Georgia.	D
I understanthat his father was Director of Public Safety in Athens, Georgia, some years ago, anI have every reason to believe he will continue his fine career in public service in his new capacity, anyou certainly have my support.	D
As General Counsel for the Department of Commerce, the nominee will be the Chief Legal Officer of the agency anwill oversee a variety of counsels ranging from the Patent anTrade Office to the Export-Import Offices.	N
I think a little later, Mr. Chairman, the Committee with hear Dr. Michael Adams, the President of the University of Georgia.	N
Dr. Adams is here to present his views in the current situation regarding college sport gambling.	N
We are aware of the controversy surrounding the issue anI look forwarto his testimony.	N
Dr. Adams is no stranger to the Senate, having serveSenator--Majority Leader, HowarBaker, for 6 years, 3 of which he was his Chief of Staff.	N
He has helpeto make the University of Georgia one of the finest public universities in the country, anis quickly becoming a leading national figure in all issues affecting our education.	D
Mr. Chairman unfortunately, due to the previously schedulehearings, I won't be able to stay for today's hearing, but I look forwarto the testimony of witnesses.	N
I look forwarto moving your nomination as quickly as possible so that you can get to work as quickly as possible.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you especially for having this hearing for these important nominees.	N
It is my special pleasure to introduce to our committee Nancy Victory as the President's nominee for the post of Assistant Secretary for Communications anInformation in the U.S. Department of Commerce.	N
Not only is Nancy a tremendously qualifieto leathis important office within the Department of Commerce.	D
I note here it says maybe she puts in that many hours at Wiley, Rein & Fielding, anshe is a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, anhas been for 7 years, anwe are very prouto have her as a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia.	D
She taught at Georgetown or went to law school at Georgetown University, graduatecum laude.	D
She has experience anknowledge garnerein the private sector dealing with a great number of technology issues which I think makes her an ideal choice to be the President's principal voice on domestic aninternational telecommunications aninformation technology issues.	D
Yesterday, we haa hearing, very important hearing, on the issue of trying to finadditional spectrum for the ever-	N
The National Telecommunications anInformation Administration, or NTIA, which Nancy will head, is an essential player in meeting these very truly important missions since the agency is responsible for managing the Federal Government's use of the radio frequency spectrum.	N
The efforts of NTIA, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Defense, anall the private sector interests, as we witnesseyesterday will significantly impact short-term anlong-term policies relateto truly one of America's most vital economic annational security interests.	N
Nancy Victory is uniquely qualifieto serve as the Assistant Secretary of NTIA, given her 12 years plus of experience covering spectrum issues in particular.	D
As a partner with the law firm of Wiley, Rein & Fielding, Ms. Victory gainea great deal of expertise in wireless ansatellite issues, including spectrum allocation, licensing, ancompliance.	D
AnI have met Nancy on several occasions over the years, anI feel very strongly that with her experience anher knowledge, I am convinceshe will be a tremendous asset to our country's technological advancements.	D
I know she will bring all those years of experience anharwork on the very difficult anrelevant telecommunications issues that we face today in her role as Assistant Secretary.	D
I also can say with great confidence that she is a woman of outstanding character anI have no doubt she will serve our country with integrity anwill certainly meet the needs of all Americans, consumers, as well as our telecommunications enterprises alike.	D
So in closing, I hope the Committee will move quickly on her nomination so she can get to work on these important issues for the competitive advantage of our country in the years to come.	D
Welcome, anI have been most interestein filling that position at the Commerce Department for quite a while.	N
NTIA, I believe, is one of the most important seats there is down there, anto have someone of your capability, your leadership is really good.	D
Yesterday we haour first hearing on spectrum anspectrum reform and, of course, with the 3G, thirgeneration wireless upon us now, your position becomes very, very important, so we are looking forwarto working with you as we wander down that path to spectrum reform anmanagement reform.	N
I am going to ask consent to include a statement in the recorfrom Senator Helms in addition to the statement made by the Congresswoman a few minutes ago in support of the nomination of Dr. Jeffrey Runge.	N
You actually answeresome of the questions, or addressesome of the questions I was going to ask you questions about.	N
But on the broadbandeployment, I know the concern of the two Senators here, Chairman Dorgan anSenator Burns, as far as getting broadband, especially to rural areas.	N
As my goofriend, Senator Burns will say, there is a lot of dirt to dig if you are using fiber-optics as a way of doing it.	N
sponsor of Senator Rockefeller's bill, S. 88, which is a broadbantax credit for deployment.	N
What woulyour view be of making it more, let us say technology neutral, in that the incentives are there as well for wireless, which may be a more practical way of getting broadbancapabilities to rural areas anmountain hollers anso forth?	N
I do suspect that fiber will be important, anwireless will be, as well as satellite, in that mix.	N
However, there is a great deal of concern about the timing of this, when it shoulgo forward, anobviously in some regards, depending upon which part of the spectrum is allocated, national security matters as well.	N
At this point, woulyou be willing to identify the most promising chunks of the 1755 to 1850 megahertz spectrum that coulbe available in the short term for commercial 3G use?	N
Now, in the short term, there is going to be an auction, or there may be an auction on the 1710 to 1755 megahertz chunk of the spectrum to release that.	N
There was discussion about waiting on that with concerns that many in the commercial industry are not ready to utilize it, but others will say gosh, we have to get involvein it, otherwise we will be left out whenever that arises.	N
What is your, if you do have a view, or if the Administration has a view, on the timing of that auction?	N
That is going to be probably one of the first decisions working with Dr. Powell, but you'll all have to determine, I believe, on that issue.	N
It is pretty obvious from yesterday when we hathe hearing on spectrum that we are not using the spectrum that we have allocatenow that is already in use efficiently.	N
In other words, there are new technologies that woulallow us to do a lot more with the spectrum that has already been allocated.	N
Well, it will always be obvious that the industry will always say we neemore spectrum, we neemore spectrum.	N
Whenever we start down this roaof trying to pass any kinof legislation that deals with management of that spectrum, if you think there was a lot of moving parts in the 1996 Act, you wait until we start down this roaof performing this.	N
AnI woulsuggest that, I think the role that you will play as the liaison between Congress anthe Administration, or putting forth the Administration's approach to how they woullike to see their policies with regarto telecommunications.	D
The FCC, you have two different roles, I think, annow we have hearsuggestions that we should, some of the functions, they shoulbe put together anfunction together--NTIA anFCC.	N
I think your function is primarily in the area of policy anhow the Administration views telecommunications anwhere you want it to go.	N
It was fairly obvious yesterday that if we do not allocate more spectrum, then the technologies to use the present spectrum--in other words, putting a lot more in a bushel basket than just a bushel--that those technologies will continue to be developed.	N
Now I am just going to ask you, what do you think the wireless industry will look like in 5 years, in 10 years from now?	N
What kinof a vision do you see the role that it plays ancan you, not right now, but I woulsay our next visit, advise us on how we can get there?	N
Dr. Runge, I think you are taking over a very important post, anI appreciate you coming by the office anvisiting.	N
I just want to tell you that we have all haour experiences in an emergency room, anso I am very aware of your work, anthe importance of your work, analso the importance of your vision of what you are taking on here.	D
Mr. Wolff anMr. Hammerschmidt, of course, I know Mr. Hammerschmidt's father, too, anso we welcome you all to public service.	D
We are very fortunate in this country to have people who are willing to go through anjump through all of these hoops, fill out all this damnable paperwork.	N
AnI just heaback for the hills anthis is the last time you woulever see this olcowboy.	N
But nonetheless, it proves to me that there are people who sincerely want to serve this country.	N
Anhave an idea, ana vision of where we want to go, anI applauyou for that because it is a work--it is a labor of love.	N
Dr. Runge, as you know, as part of the TREAD Act, NHTSA was given some very substantial tasks, anI think there are upwards of a dozen rulemaking processes going on.	N
I think the tire pressure rulemaking was just released, but tire standards, rollovers anothers.	N
If you neemore resources, are you committeto moving forwaron all these fronts, anif you neemore resources, will you come to us for more resources?	N
Let me ask you, why are you unable, in your judgment, to get broadbanor DSL broadbanservice in your home?	N
Because the provider that normally wouldo that has simply decidethey are not going to do it.	N
If the Senator woulyield, I just got this last week, got a little flyer anI have been poking arounanlooking for it.	N
There is some wireless services that are coming in now, are being deployed, anwe are going to look into those situations, but there is some competition coming, annow, when it wakes up the local loop guy, I do not know.	N
The reason I askethe question is because you anMs. Victory anI anvirtually everyone else are subject to the whims of an incumbent carrier who decides whether they will or will not builout DSL.	N
There are many areas of this country where you ought to have DSL service, they say we are not going to do that.	N
Anthe bull's eye of public policy in my judgment for you in a wide range of areas is to make sure we have communications capability in this country that are universal, anthat includes not just a telephone, but it includes advanceservices which we wrote in the 1996 Act.	N
The only way that is going to happen is if it is supporteby the universal service funif the FCC is cappecontrary to the law we wrote, Senator Burns anI, anothers actually helpewrite those provisions.	N
My hope is that every day when you go to work you understanthat I couldn't get DSL at my home anI am a little upset by that anI am going to change public policy that provides robust competition, but provides stimulus to those incumbent carriers so we get riof this digital divide.	N
You want to responto that, colleagues, I think the President has chosen well, anI woulecho the comments by Senator Burns.	N
It is important to ask men anwomen to present themselves for public service to serve our country anyou anyour families I hope are prouof your willingness to do that.	N
Today the Committee will hola hearing on the nominations of Chief R. DaviPaulison to be U.S. Fire Administrator anDr. Arden Bement to be Director of the National Institute of Standards anTechnology.	N
Each of these individuals, I believe, will be confirmed, because they are very qualifieanare going to play a critical role in our war against terrorism.	D
Obviously, science is getting increasingly important as it relates to America's national security.	N
Since the attacks on September 11th anthe anthrax scares of the past several weeks, it is clear that our science antechnology can, in fact, be useagainst us.	N
During the first days of the crisis, some news organizations were reporting that anthrax from American labs was actually sent to Iraq in the 1980's as part of a scientific effort.	N
Although the report dinot mention government involvement in such an effort, the inherent risks are unmistakable.	N
It is our view that intellectual security needs to be part of any national security approach and, given the possibilities of the misuse of science, there is tremendous potential in harnessing science antechnology in an affirmative anprotective way.	N
That can include everything from developing the technology to safely lanairplanes from a control tower insteaof a cockpit to using science to quickly create antidotes anvaccines to potential bioterrorism agents.	N
Clearly, taxpayer funds, smartly investein scientific advances, ultimately rewaranbenefit the safety anpeace of minof all citizens.	N
This Committee is acutely aware that information technology anscientific information such as that developeat NIST is critical to combatting terrorism.	N
I think it is also worth noting that, no matter how gooyour technology anscience are, it always comes down to people.	N
That is why it is so important that we work closely with our nominees anevaluate their qualifications today.	N
The people on the front lines responding to domestic incidents from biological to conventional attacks will be our nation's firefighters, anwe look forwarto having you represent them, Chief Paulison.	N
The Subcommittee on Science, Technology, anSpace has recently hela hearing on the needs of the Fire Service in responding to terrorism.	N
This country has more than a million firefighters, anthe federal government must be a better partner in working to ensure that these dedicateancourageous Americans have the tools to do their jobs.	N
Towards that end, several weeks ago I calleMitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of Management anBudget, to ask that he make supplemental funding available immediately from the grants that are available under the Firefighter Investment anResponse statute so that local fire departments can get the needetraining anequipment that is so essential.	N
Chief Paulison has been tappeto leaFEMA's U.S. Fire Administration anbe the firefighters' voice within the federal government.	D
Chief, we know you brought several members of your family with you today, anwe woulvery much like you to introduce them anhave them stanat this time.	N
Also our goofortune to have Dr. Bement here, who has been nominateto direct NIST, anwe will consider his nomination as we consider Chief Paulison's.	N
The Fire Administration anNIST have a long history of working together on building anfire research.	N
At the urging of New York's Fire Department leaders who testifieat our hearing on the needs of the Fire Service, I have written to Secretary of Commerce Don Evans to ask that NIST begin to look at developing standards for firefighting equipment.	N
One of the concerns that the Subcommittee has hearis that as equipment becomes more technologically sophisticatesmall departments have only the claims of the manufacturer to use in evaluating essential products.	N
Currently NIST's Office of Law Enforcement Standards has measures for low enforcement equipment such as bulletproof vests.	N
The Subcommittee is interestein working with the agency to see that effort expandeto include firefighters' equipment as well.	N
We want to congratulate the scientists both at NIST anNIST-supportescientists who sharein the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2001, anwe are going to be discussing with Dr. Bement some of the priorities that he will have at the agency.	N
With that, I really woullike to recognize my colleagues because I know their schedule is very tight.	N
But Dr. Bement, before we do that I understanyou have some family here as well, anwe woullike you to have a chance to introduce them.	N
We are glayou are out in force, anwe will have some more to say about your distinguishebackground, Dr. Bement.	D
I enjoyeour visit yesterday, as chaotic as it was, given the fact that we were standing up in the Capitol basement looking for space.	N
He has been a great addition to this Subcommittee anbrings to this Committee expertise in areas such as space aninsurance ana whole host of areas.	D
I hathe goofortune, Mr. Chairman, of being Chairman of a subcommittee of which Ms. Morella was a part, anshe was an outstanding member.	D
A lot of her interest in science antechnology goes back to those days when we were first put on that Committee in the House.	D
He is a frienwhose services are going to be enjoyein the federal government, particularly in something that, as we approach the threat of terrorism, we cannot afforto have less than the best.	D
I hathe opportunity to observe him from my capacity as the State Fire Marshal for Florida.	N
That is a job that a lot of the officials in the past never have paimuch attention to, because the job is a lot more than that.	N
As you can imagine, in that capacity I got to work with Daviin his current position as the Chief of the Miami-Dade Fire anRescue Department.	D
In 30 years of his dedicatepublic service, he rose from the rank of a rescue firefighter to fire chief.	D
He oversees 1900 personnel, a $200 million operating budget, ana $70 million capital budget.	D
His distinguisheservice on behalf of Miami-Dade County anthe state of Florida has causehis expertise to be sought out arounthe country annow by our federal government.	D
He is Past President of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, anhe is currently a member of the Boarof Directors of the American ReCross.	D
So now, as the heaof the U.S. Fire Administration, he is going to serve us in an additional capacity.	D
I think it is important for Members of Congress to do that when they know ancan testify as to the character anexpertise of an individual.	D
I also want to be joineby my colleague Bob Graham, who is in an Intelligence Committee meeting right now anwho has submittea letter endorsing Chief Paulison.	N
I am going to leave, with your permission, so that I can tento some other things having to do with all kinds of nasty guys trying to do bathings anus trying to prevent them.	N
We appreciate your coming and, in spite of your desire to be calle``Marshal,'' I am glathey call you ``Senator.''	N
I can assure you it is a great privilege, anone of the great privileges is having the opportunity to work with folks like you.	N
Suffice it to say, having haa chance to work with you, Connie, during my career in the House, it is just great to have you.	N
You are constantly on the side of trying to practice googovernment out there anbring people together.	D
We really appreciate your coming, anwe will make your prepareremarks part of the recorin full, anyou may proceein any way that you feel comfortable.	N
But I am just very honoreto speak in support of this wonderful nominee anthis great, great nomination for the country.	N
As you know, I have watcheyou work on NIST issues over the years anyou are really one of the people we look to for guidance on these issues.	D
In fact, first we'll have your presentation, then we will hear from Mr. Paulison, anfinally I will have questions for each of you.	N
We will make your prepareremarks a part of the recorin full, anif you woullike to just highlight some of your major concerns that woulbe helpful.	N
We haour hearing for Dr. John Marburger, as you know, who will be heading up Science anTechnology, anwe discussethe neefor a coordinateeffort among the federal science agencies in conducting research to combat terrorism.	N
We were concerneabout the General Accounting Office report that showethat often the left handoes not talk to the right hand.	N
They said, for example, that the Coast Guaranthe Defense Department were doing the same research on chemical weapons detection for cruise ships.	N
So you enup taking dollars away from critically needefunctions because of duplication, anyou do not have the benefits of the sharing of information.	N
Why do we not start by having you describe how you see NIST being a part of this fight against terrorism.	N
You have obvious areas with respect to technical competencies, such as quantum computing, encryption, sensing tiny amounts of substances.	D
On the question of fire research, as I mentioned, we lookeat fire services issues in some depth not long ago.	N
We hearat our hearing testimony from a number of witnesses, including the New York Fire Department, in which they describethe neefor the development of performance standards for firefighter equipment.	N
They saiat this point there are not any standards by which they can credibly evaluate the new equipment, particularly the equipment containing advancetechnologies.	N
After we hearthat testimony, I wrote Secretary Evans asking that NIST look into this issue anset up a program to deal with it specifically, such as the one that now exists at NIST for law enforcement services anequipment.	N
Coulyou state for the recorwhether you are willing to put together a program that addresses the concerns raiseby the firefighters at the Subcommittee's recent hearing?	N
Tell me then, because that is very helpful anvery constructive, to have your position with respect to putting together a program on the standards for the equipment, what other areas of research do you think are promising as it relates to NIST in terms of getting the next generation of advancefirefighting technology out to the firefighters?	N
My understanding is you have got one-quarter of your people, something like upwards of 800 people, eligible for retirement this year.	N
Suffice it to say, again anagain we are getting these reports about the great neefor talented, dedicatepeople in federal service.	N
GAO has citethe human capital challenges as a top concern affecting many federal managers.	N
How do you plan to address this issue so that NIST has an adequate supply of young researchers ready to step in?	N
I woullike to know if you plan to expanyour postdoctoral program or other kinds of approaches so that we can attract more young researchers.	N
In terms of your resources, I woullike to know whether you think you have got enough resources anfacilities to continue the kinof work that has producethe Nobel Prizes, the repeateinstances where you have won, anwhether you have the resources to deal with the relationship with the Technology Administration, which as you know has always been unique ana big disparity between NIST anthe Technology Administration.	N
Why do you not talk for a moment so we have it on the recorhow you are going to approach this question of the adequacy of resources.	N
As you know, Bayh-Dole anStevenson-Weidler are essentially the two statutes that govern cooperative research anthe licensing of federal inventions.	N
I am of the view that, at this point, the statute does not work anywhere near as well as it coulfor all of the stakeholders, businesses, universities antaxpayers.	N
I am interesteparticularly in the involvement with the laboratories as it relates to universities anbusinesses.	N
They are constantly talking to me about delays anthe amount of paperwork that they have to slog through to be part of the statute.	N
When you look at the numbers in terms of return on investment research, they look pretty paltry.	N
I have, as I indicateto you yesterday, made it clear that I want to see the Administration look again at this statute anlook at ways, working with all of the stakeholders, that it can be improved.	N
I woullike to have you tell me how you see the tech transfer system working at NIST, given the fact that your operation, as we talkeabout yesterday, is one piece of the puzzle.	N
I think we can streamline the retape anthe bureaucracy that has been frustrating for businesses anuniversities, anI think we can shore up the return on investment for taxpayers.	N
Secretary Bonis a gooman, anI appreciate your taking it up with him anwith FloyKvamme, if you will do that anget back to us.	D
In fact, I woullike you, if you would, coulyou get back to us within 90 days after you are confirmeangive us your sense of how NIST, to the extent you can, anthe Administration is willing the proceeas we look to try anstrengthen?	N
I am always anxious to avoigetting entanglein legislative rewrites of complicatestatutes.	N
But, I woullike to see us take this out through the prism of each of the stakeholders--universities, businesses, laboratories, antaxpayers.	N
We are going to get you confirmequickly so you can go to work on these another pressing matters.	N
Well, thank you anI think you are going to be sparea little bit now while we will go to Mr. Paulison.	N
I think, given the fact that you are there in Miami-Dade, you have seen first-hanwhat local fire departments are up against.	N
Tell us what you think the biggest needs are anwhat your priorities woulbe at the U.S. Fire Administration to address, the big priorities?	N
We are going to have a specific Subcommittee hearing to look at some of the technology aspects of what happeneon September 11th.	N
You may have hearthat I have actually suggestethat we look at something along the lines of a technology equivalent of the national Guard, a kinof effort to mobilize people in the private sector so that we have got the equipment anthe brains anthe talent, essentially, ready to go.	N
Tell me, if you would--ansort of step back from what you saiearlier--what the problems were in terms of interoperability when people trieto be in contact with each other in that situation anwhat you think we might do to deal with it?	N
Now, I gather that you trieto do some of these things in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.	N
I reathe article that you wrote in ``Fire Chief'' magazine, anit talks about your prepositioning platform aerials arounyour county angenerators anportable repeaters, in effect, a backup kinof communications system.	N
Do you think it woulbe helpful to have people from the private sector in the communications antechnology sector in position to try to assist you, a sort of talent pool that you coulcall on to re-establish normal communications?	N
We will be looking to work with you as we go forwarwith the hearings in an effort to develop an initiative.	N
You are a local fire chief, so you can tell us a bit about what it is like to go through the bureaucracy anthe retape anwhat you can do to improve the process there, anthen I am sure you have hasome thoughts already about what you will do after confirmation.	N
What coulbe done that woulreally be helpful to a local fire chief, since you hale from those ranks, anthen what seems doable to you in terms of the Washington, DC., situation?	N
Now, as you know there is a lot of discussion in the Congress about hiring a substantial number of new firefighters, a discussion of perhaps 70,000 new firefighters.	N
We woullike to know if you think a program like this is needed, do you have the resources to administer it, anwhat you think of the suggestion that the Department of Labor woulrun it?	N
The only other question I have for you, Mr. Paulison, deals with preparedness coordination.	N
As you know, the General Accounting Office has been making recommendations for several years now to reduce duplication animprove coordination of the assistance programs to the first responders.	N
They cite in their most recent report that there is still some confusion about these various kinds of programs.	N
What in your view coulbe done to responto what the GAO has been talking about with respect to confusion among federal assistance programs?	N
As you can tell, it is particularly hectic right now with so many colleagues being pulleto other meetings.	N
Chairman Hollings is, as well, given the fact that we are already asking you for projects anto do things about standards for firefighter equipment anget into whole areas you never thought you wouleven be askeabout, like Bayh-Dole, Dr. Bement.	N
We have got to get you all credentialeanapproved, anI am confident that the Senate is going to do that.	N
On behalf of the Committee, we are very pleasethat two distinguisheindividuals such as yourselves are interesteanwilling to serve our country right now.	N
They have been very cooperative, starting with Secretary Evans anthe other individuals that you have talkeabout today, anI think that is a very appropriate one to quit on because that is what it is going to take, that kinof bipartisan effort maximize the success of our policies in an area that obviously is in the forefront of the public's attention.	N
We are very prouof what all of those in your profession have done to help our country when very often it is not at all expecteando it extraordinarily well.	N
Senator Hutchison from Texas was going to be here, Captain, to present you, but was unavoidably not able to do it, with the aviation security conference going on, which is why a number of our Members happen to be absent, because we are trying to get that important legislation out before we leave for the recess.	N
This morning we are here to consider the nominee for Maritime Administrator, Captain William Schubert.	N
I appreciate very much that the Administration has nominatean individual who has actual experience in this particular area dealing with the merchant marine.	D
Captain Schubert has previously workeat the Maritime Administration anbrings a great deal of knowledge anexperience in that very important field.	D
You helpefacilitate the sealift operation during the Persian Gulf effort, which was very difficult, indeed.	D
I think it is important that we get you in place as soon as possible anhope we can take this to the floor this week.	N
1969 graduate of King's Point Merchant Marine Academy anwe will not holit against you, but your brother-in-law is one of our former colleagues, Senator Bill Brock.	D
My home state of Louisiana obviously is one that is very concerneabout the merchant marine, the maritime, anwhat we do at the Maritime Administration.	N
We are obviously very heavily dependent on maritime industry anmaritime transportation in general.	N
Louisiana is the bottom of the funnel through which two-thirds of this nation drains all of their waterways anobviously that creates some problems, but it also creates enormous economic benefits for the state analso for the nation.	N
We live near anare on the waterways anthe Gulf of Mexico, so we certainly in our areas understanthe importance of ports, understanthe importance of a strong maritime industry, anknow quite well in my state, anI woulhope the rest of the Congress feels the same, that this is something the government needs to be involvein.	N
We cannot just say to the U.S. maritime industry gooluck, pat you on the back, anhope you are successful, because, in fact, our industry has to compete not just with fellow American companies, but we have to compete throughout the world.	N
Many times we finour industries having to compete, not with other companies alone, but other companies who work with their governments very closely anin many cases are partially owneby their governments.	N
So it is a very unlevel competitive fielthat our industry must face as we ply the oceans of the world.	N
I think that there are many of us that recognize that, while we are free enterprise supporters, that we have to recognize that you have to deal with the hanthat you have been dealt, anuntil all the worloperates as we do that there is a very legitimate role for the U.S. government in helping to guarantee that we remain strong as a maritime nation.	N
The Congress does not have a 100 percent view of the importance of some of the things the Maritime Administration does.	N
In fact, some of the folks in the Administration do not like some of the programs that you administer.	N
Title 11 obviously is one of these, where they recommended, as I remember, zero funding for the Title 11 program, which is a program where we have hathe ability to aiour U.S. industries, not through giving them money or giving them grants or giving them construction subsidies, but rather giving them loan guarantees whereby they can go to the private markets anborrow money to builships in U.S. yards that will have U.S. sailors on board, anthat that loan has to be repaiby the private company anonly if they default woulthe government have to participate in picking up a portion of that loan, anit is only a portion of the loan.	N
We regularly funthe differential or the risk factor in getting a loan that is guaranteeby the government.	N
That is a program that has workevery well anit has workevery well for a very long time.	N
It has particular challenges now because of the economy anparticularly in some of the civilian cruise ships that we are watching very closely.	N
This is going to be on your watch, anit is going to be tough, because you are going to be in the middle.	N
You work for the Administration, but you also have to follow the laws of the Congress, anthe Congress has saivery strongly that the Title 11 program is one that we support, this Committee supports, this Congress supports, anit is the law of the land.	N
You have somebody downtown on Pennsylvania Avenue looking over your shoulder anyou are going to have Congress looking over your shoulder, anyou have to carry forward.	N
You are not going to come up here ansay, I do not know anything about ships, I am not for an American fleet, anI am not for an American flag, I am not for American seamen.	N
But we want to make sure, anI think you are that type of person, that it is more than words.	D
It has got to be a real commitment, that you know this is an opportunity for you, it is an opportunity for this country, because you have a great challenge anevery challenge presents great opportunities if we accept them.	N
Norm Mineta, the Secretary, a goofrienof mine, former colleague of mine, he was happy when I left the House because it movehim up one seat anhe became Chairman of the Public Works anTransportation Committee.	N
He was one of my most enthusiastic backers to run for the Senate, so he coulbecome Chairman of the Public Works Committee in the House, annow he is Secretary of the Department.	D
But he has got a lot of other things on his plate, anthere has got to be a voice that nags at him constantly.	N
You have got to be the nagger for the oceans, the nagger for the maritime industry, anthe nagger for the programs, because nobody else is going to be the advocate over there.	N
The maritime transportation system, the Department of Transportation dia recent report that talkeabout the fantastic growth in the maritime trade worldwide, but at the same time they spoke of the rapidecrease in capacity that we have.	N
So on the one hanthe maritime trade worldwide is really increasing, but the U.S.'s ability to participate in that is decreasing in the sense that we are rapidly running out of ships, they are becoming older, more aged, anbeing retired.	N
Do we just say, all right, we will have all the trade in the world, we will ship everything, but we will just ship it on tankers from ThirWorlcountries under flags of convenience?	N
Suppose the Office of Management anBudget Director Mitch Daniels calls you up ansays: Bill, come down; I want to talk to you about Title 11; I want you to go down to the White House ansit with the President antell him what you think about it; I have recommendethat it be zero-funded.	N
You go in the Oval Office anPresident Bush says: Captain, I am trying to get riof this maritime program calleTitle 11; what shoulI do?	N
That is why I phrasethe question, if the President calls you in ansays, Captain, what do you think about this program.	N
My question to you is if the President says, Captain, what do you think about the Title 11 program, am I right or am I wrong?	N
If he only listens to people that are landlubbers, they are going to say zero it out, it is not needed.	N
If they say eliminate it anthat is my final decision, you have to carry out those recommendations.	N
But in reaching those recommendations andeciding on those positions, if they call you anask you what do you think, I woulhope that the person in charge of the Maritime Administration woulbe in a position to advocate a program that I think Congress has always saiis important anhas been successful.	N
Because let me tell you, if you do not advocate it there ain't going to be nobody else down there.	N
For the maritime, we do not have anybody else that is higher up dealing with ships anthe maritime industry than you are going to be.	N
So we have to depenon you for making arguments as to why we shoulhave programs that help these areas, because if you do not there is not going to be anybody else there that will.	N
I accept that anwant to give you all the help you can angive you all the support you can in making those arguments.	N
But a lot of times you are going to be the only one in the room that is going to have the opportunity to speak aggressively for this industry anwe are counting on you to do that.	N
If you look at the programs that are trust funprograms that we have, we have a trust funfor the highway program.	N
You pay your gas tax, 100 percent of it goes into the trust funanit is usefor things that are important to people who pay the tax.	N
You have got an aviation trust fund, dollar in, dollar out; highway trust fund, dollar in, dollar out.	N
But the maritime industry, according to some of the earlier figures that I have seen, is contributing through taxes about $22 billion annually, $22 billion, anwe are getting back about $5 billion.	N
So if you look at what we are doing with things that fly, things that are on roads, they get back what they put in.	N
But this industry is significantly different in that people who ship things, who pay fees antaxes, fuel taxes antaxes for the intercoastal waterways, inlanwaterways, the customs duties--anwhat else?	N
If you aup all these various taxes that are paifor the maritime industry, we are not getting back anywhere anything that compares with what these other areas are getting.	N
But when you kick in $22 billion anyou only get back $5 billion, something is wrong, because in aviation it is not like that, in highways anroads it is not like that.	N
We are going to raise it anI really woullike to work cooperatively with the Administration to see whether we cannot get a more reflective anbalancesystem for money contributefrom this industry angetting it back, in terms of whether it is seaport security or whether it is in terms of port development or whether it is in terms of U.S. maritime fleet expansion.	N
You know, I think a lot of people think that, well, all these tonnage taxes anall these other things are coming right back to the industry, anit is really not.	N
I think that you uniquely bring some qualifications to this job that are in keeping with what this Committee anthis Congress wants to see in a Maritime Administration.	D
My daughter works with a law firm in New Orleans ancalleme yesterday, because I am in the Hart Building--well, I am not really in the Hart Building.	N
I am supposeto be in the Hart Building, but the Hart Building is closed, so we have not been getting all of the mail.	N
One of the clients in their law firm has written a very strong letter of support to me on your behalf, asking that I support you for Maritime Administrator.	N
Since we hanot respondebecause we hanot gotten the letter, they got my daughter to call me anto say----	N
I thought she was calling asking for money, but she was calling to ask me to support your nomination.	N
I said, ``Well, call the people back antell them not only am I supporting it, I am chairing the confirmation hearing, so you are in really gooshape''.	N
With that, we hope that this Committee will--I woulimagine we will try anhave something off the floor whereby we will report this nomination anget it to the floor so you can get to work, Captain, angoosailing.	N
It seems to change every few minutes, anmy apologies to you for the delay anany inconvenience.	N
We are pleasetoday to consider the nomination of Vice Admiral ConraLautenbacher as the eighth Under Secretary for Oceans anAtmosphere anAdministrator of the National Oceanic anAtmospheric Administration.	N
We woulalso like to thank him for his ongoing cooperation anwe are glato have him here.	N
NOAA was createon October 3rd, 1970, due in large part to the work of our distinguisheChairman, Senator Hollings.	N
Congress createNOAA in order to provide ``better protection of life anproperty from natural hazards, for better understanding of the total environment, anfor exploration andevelopment leading to intelligent use of our natural resources.''	N
All the Members of this Committee recognize the neeto have an agency whose mission is to describe anpredict changes in the Earth's environment anto conserve anwisely manage the nation's coastal anmarine resources.	N
The recently establisheCommission on Public Policy is going to take a new look at these issues, which ought to raise the profile of NOAA issues nationally ancertainly here in Washington, DC.	N
With an annual appropriation of over $3 billion anover 11,000 employees locatein every state, NOAA represents over 60 percent of the Department of Commerce's budget annearly 30 percent of the total Department of Commerce workforce.	N
The agency faces a number of challenges over the next decade, including management of the coastal zone, protecting anmanaging fish stocks anmarine mammals, providing critical information on climate change, ancontinuing to protect the public anfacilitate commerce by issuing state-of-the-art forecasts anwarnings.	N
One-half of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of the coast anif population trends continue as expected, pressure on conflicting demands for ocean coastal resources are likely to increase, as will vulnerability to coastal hazards.	N
States ancoastal communities certainly neean activist federal government to improve coordination, strengthen partnerships, anprovide the necessary resources.	N
Given our nominee's experience both in anout of the federal government, he clearly is in a position to assist the NOAA team.	D
We believe your practical management experience will also serve you well in efforts to improve NOAA management of marine fisheries andevise innovative solutions.	D
As I think our nominee knows, our West Coast groundfish fishery anthe communities that depenon it are clearly in desperate shape.	N
Over the past decade, the West Coast groundfish fishery has experiencea population decline for several of the species that comprise the fishery, forcing the managers to impose even more strict regulations anleading to a great deal of economic dislocation.	N
I am particularly concernethat the management of the Northwest Region has ignorea number of these looming problems.	N
I will say that the NOAA Fisheries Director Bill Hogarth is now working to improve this situation, anclearly there is much to do.	N
I want the nominee to know that I look forwarto working with him anDr. Hogarth on these issues.	N
The challenge is to get the right number of fishers out there at the right time, catching the right number of fish, in order to make this industry sustainable.	N
The average fisherman in Oregon has now lost 40 percent of his income anin some cases regulations have cut the total allowable catch by 90 percent.	N
There has been no long-term help for the fisher who wants out of this regulatory nightmare.	N
For the past few years, Congress has provideeconomic assistance to help these folks get by anthat is to a great extent through the help of Chairman Hollings anSenator Stevens, anwe are very appreciative Senator Stevens is here.	N
But we also neeyou as our nominee to help finthese creative solutions to there being too many fishers annot enough fish.	N
I am going to put the rest of my prepareremarks into the recorso I can recognize my colleague who has been patient, Senator Stevens.	N
I am in another meeting concerning the defense bill right now, but I diwant to stop by anthank him for visiting with me.	N
But I do hope that you will look into our situation in Alaska with regarto global climate change.	N
In any event, in Alaska it is real, because there is no question that we now have sea water intrusion in many of our villages.	N
We have a situation up on the Arctic Ocean coast, where public anfederal facilities are soon to be inundatewith the Arctic Ocean.	N
The permafrost is disappearing in some areas of Alaska anit is coming to other areas of Alaska.	N
So it is not a total balance in terms of whether it is getting warmer or colder up our way, but there is change up there that needs more understanding anwe neemore basic research.	N
I think if we coulcatch up anunderstanwhat is going on in the Arctic, we might understanwhat will go on in the rest of the country in years to come.	N
I woullike to travel arounanshow you some of the things that I have seen anhopefully fina way to get you to work with NASA.	N
NASA also is very interestein this anI think that your two agencies coulgo a long way in trying to get us some understanding that we neeof what is changing anwhy in the Arctic.	N
But I do congratulate you anlook forwarto working with you, anI am sorry I have to leave, Mr. Chairman.	N
I just appreciate all the help that you anSenator Hollings have given us on these issues.	N
Admiral why do you not go aheaanmake any remarks that you choose anthen we will have some questions.	N
I appreciate very much the support of the Secretary of Commerce Evans anDeputy Secretary of Commerce Bodman in this appointment anI look forwarto working with them.	N
I am very grateful for the courtesy shown to me by the Members of this Committee that I visitethis week.	N
I am again, as I say, very happy to be here today at this hearing anlooking forwarto the future.	N
Senator Stevens certainly articulatesome of the major challenges involvewith climate change that will affect the whole country anthe whole globe, not necessarily just Alaska, although it is deeply felt in that part of our country.	N
We face a number of challenges, not just in the climate change, but in environmental management, environmental monitoring, new energy sources, in biotechnology, biodiversity, medicine anjust the general coupling of the atmosphere anthe Earth anthe ocean systems together for the well-being of humanity.	N
I think that we neeto work in the future to support anbring on boarall of the disciplines that are needeto builthe basic science necessary for goopublic policy.	N
The Earth anthe atmosphere anthe oceans remain coupleanthe work that we do in the future will affect our economic health anthe health anthe well-being of each individual of this country anindeefor the world.	N
All of our industries function today on understanding what is happening in the climate anwhat is happening in their environment.	N
We have enormous challenges in our coastal environment, managing the oceans anthe coastal ecology anthe atmosphere in those areas as well.	N
I woullike to wrap up by saying that I am a strong believer in intergovernmental cooperation.	N
I want to work together with all the agencies that deal with the oceans anthe atmosphere.	N
I want to work together with the Congress anthe members of the staffs anall the committees that cover this broaarea.	N
I am prouto have been nominateanshoulI have the privilege of earning your confirmation I look forwarto working with you.	N
My intent is to serve the President, the Secretary of Commerce, the talentepeople who make up NOAA today, anour fellow citizens across the nation.	N
As my recorshows in the past, I will work harwith the gooMembers of this Committee, the Senate anthe House in building sounprograms anbuilding support to enact those programs for the betterment of our country.	N
Admiral Lautenbacher, according to the information that you have given the Committee you do not appear to have a tremendous amount of experience regarding fisheries.	D
I guess it is fair to say that I another members of the Northwest Congressional delegation will be happy to provide the tutorials.	N
It is critically important that steps be taken to make the industry sustainable, anclearly to deal with the Northwest groundfish fishery we are going to have action for the Administration anthe total support of your office.	N
The legislation offers a buyback program fundeone-half by federal appropriation anone-half by the industry through a federal loan.	N
I think I woullike to start by asking you what alternatives woulyou propose to voluntarily decrease the number of fishers?	N
Senator, I have to agree with you that I am not experiencein the management of fisheries anthat I am learning in this area as well.	N
But to date what I have learneso far is that there are a number of opportunities that we have to combat or to deal with the overfishing.	N
I think some of the proposals that have been made for buybacks, either government-fundeor by loans, are very interesting.	N
I know that your support on this bill aninterest on this issue are very much appreciateby the Administration anby NOAA.	N
I am delighteto have on the team that has been chosen already to work in NOAA, Dr. Bill Hogarth, who as you mentioneis very experiencein this area, anBob Lawn, who is the Regional Director in the Northwest anI understanis very knowledgeable about it.	D
I think we neeto work together to buila solution that will be protective of our environment as well as ensuring that the economics of fishing maintains its viability.	N
Do you think that there needs to be a faster process to get disaster money out to communities?	N
The reason I am asking this question is that the West Coast groundfish fishery was declarea disaster in January of 2000 anit took nearly 12 months after funding was appropriated.	N
Frankly, at that point I haa hearing on the coast in Oregon anit was clear it was not ever going to get out.	N
We basically said, look, we are going to bring folks there constantly until the money gets out, anfinally it did.	N
In our legislation we require NMFS to report to Congress on how they coulspeeup the distribution of disaster money.	N
I woulbe interestein whether you think there does neeto be a faster process to get it out.	N
I think it is important that emergency assistance shoulbe receiveby the people who deserve to have it as soon as possible.	N
Now, at present the IRS taxes this money as regular income anat the same time puts families off the fooassistance rolls.	N
Fishermen also have to shovel large quantities of fish overboarbecause of regulatory or market restrictions on what they can bring to the dock.	N
I have been working for years to get NOAA to create a program so we woulnot have the disgrace of having all of these needy people in the UniteStates anpeople chucking fish overboard.	N
I think it is very unfortunate anI woulbe interestein knowing what ideas you have for eliminating this, the waste of this resource.	N
I will have to look into the rules anregulations that have createthat situation, Senator.	N
It sounds to me like we neeto work on that anI woulbe happy to work with you to try to solve that situation.	N
I mean, there are pictures repeatedly in major publications all across this country of people throwing fish overboard.	N
It is a disgrace that there is not a system that gets this resource to needy people while at the same time not leading to overfishing anthe like, which presumably has been the argument.	N
I hope that you will do better than your predecessor, because your predecessor made a commitment.	N
This is one of the most flagrant examples of waste that I have seen in my years in public service.	N
You are throwing this report overboarwhen you have needy people, when you have all the economic hurting communities across this country.	N
Tell us what process you think you woullike to pursue to ensure better cooperation between the agencies anfishermen anprocessors in order to address the sustainability question anmaintain fishing communities.	N
Again, I woullike to address that after I have haa chance to look more at the way the agency works.	N
But, in general, I woulsay that what I see as a private citizen is, first of all, controversy over the basic science anthe pieces that we put together to make, builthe criteria on which we judge ourselves.	N
I see contention between the various components anadvocates of various parts of our society, working on data which generally is inadequate or not fully thought out.	N
I think that we neea process that builds the proper basic knowledge of science anknowledge of the fishing environment to the point where people at least agree on the basic facts.	N
At that point, I think we neeto have a balance in the constituencies that are representein this important area of our country, both economically anfrom quality of life.	N
NMFS has been conducting stock assessment surveys in the West Coast groundfish fishery every 3 years insteaof every year.	N
So at this point there is not adequate data on 83 of the species that comprise the groundfish fishery.	N
The law states that a precautionary management approach is requireto conserve the stocks that we have left.	N
How woulyou go about complying with that law anmaking sure that there are resources to conduct scientifically valiassessments on an annual basis?	N
I do not have enough of the details of how the agency does that work or the resources that are involved.	N
This is something I feel very strongly about anI think it is important that when you are before this Committee you can talk at least to some degree specifically about matters that are important to my constituents.	N
This is something that has been in front of the agency for a long time anI hope that you get up to speeon this.	N
I am going to give you some additional questions in writing on the West Coast groundfish fishery.	N
But this is something that I feel very strongly about anI think we have got to get your people working on this anpursuing it vigorously.	N
Let me ask you about one other issue that is important to my constituents anthen we will turn to some other matters.	N
NOAA is responsible for making forecasts on water levels in an important part of my state, in the Klamath Basin.	N
Each year the forecast comes out on April 1st, but the farmers have to make their decisions before April 1st.	N
Woulyou be willing to work with me, anI know my colleague Senator Smith feels very strongly about this as well, to look into a way to help the farmers get the information they neeearlier?	N
My backgrounon this tells me that some of that information is available anwe shoulbe able to make it available to you much earlier.	N
Ongoing oceanographic research is critical to the nation's understanding of the physical world.	N
I view ocean observing anocean exploration as kinof the two bookends of the knowledge set that we neeto fill up to put on our bookshelf of knowledge about the oceans.	N
I think there remains much to be discovereabout the oceans anwe neethe work at it from both ends, both observations anexploration.	N
Offshore aquaculture has the potential for increasing the amount of domestic fish entering the U.S. market, thereby decreasing the deficit, while at the same time ensuring that aquaculture goes forwarin an environmentally sounfashion.	N
I think that is the place where we are going to have the greatest opportunity to increase our economic value of fish anfisheries in the UniteStates.	N
Well, I think we have a lot of issues with the way we set these fish farms up anthe research that has been done on the types of breeding anconditions under which they live, in which they can cross-breewith native species.	N
We neelots more work in terms of the basic research on it anwe neethe support work that is ongoing right now.	N
For many years there have been attempts to eliminate the NOAA corps, as well as the NOAA fleet, both of which are essential in terms of the mapping ancharting mission of the agency.	N
The recent public anscientific success of the Ocean Exploration Initiative only underscores the importance of preserving anexpanding the fleet ancorps.	N
How woulyou assess the adequacy of NOAA's aircraft anoceanographic fleet to support the current ananticipateneeds?	N
Again, I woullike more time to assess the requirements, but in general, I believe that the NOAA corps is a valuable part of that agency.	N
I believe that we neethe recapitalize the fleet that NOAA uses, as well as the aircraft fleet.	N
These are essential tools in research anbasic observation of physical phenomenon that we are all interestein.	N
Woulyou agree that NOAA's naval deputy coulbe helpful in procuring new ocean assets for the fleet, like remotely operatevehicles for use by the agency anthe university community in ocean exploration?	N
Now, one other area that a number of the Senators on the Committee are interestein is the effectiveness of coastal zone management.	N
In 1972, it was certainly a revolutionary approach to go about addressing the increasing threats poseto fragile coastal areas.	N
Coastal populations, as you know, are growing in many areas of the country anthe modern pace of development seems to have outstrippethe nation's ability to protect some of these coastal areas.	N
With the thirtieth anniversary coming up in 2002, it seems like an ideal time to take a close look at coastal zone management's effectiveness at the local level.	N
Tell me, if you would, how you woulpursue a management review of the program so as to maximize its potential?	N
I think that many of our problems that we are going to face are going to be in the coastal zone.	N
As both you anSenator Stevens have stated, the majority of our population, at least 50 percent at this point, the majority will be living in the coastal areas.	N
I intento, when I get to NOAA, take a look at the coastal management programs as they are set up anreview them ansee what needs to be done.	N
Any ideas on strengthening anaccelerating coastal protection efforts at the grounlevel insteaof or perhaps in addition to some of the state programmatic grants?	N
Well, I am a believer in partnerships in this area, so I think that we neeto continue to partner with the state anlocal agencies, the federal government.	N
There is a definite neefor the regions to be able to come in with their specific needs andeal with it.	N
So I am a supporter of partnerships with the agencies involvein each one of these issues.	N
So often, it just seems that those people come to our community meetings anthe like ansay, nobody is talking to us, nobody is aware of us.	N
So if you can make sure that the partnership has those people at the table, that is the key.	N
Let me state, just so that the recoris clear, that Secretary Evans has been extremely helpful.	N
When we hato get that groundfish money out where it hajust been idling for months anmonths, I think Secretary Evans barely got a chance to get to his phone when I callehim.	N
I am blesseto be surroundeby more wisdom anability in the U.S. Senate than at any time previously, anI thank my colleagues for being here.	N
Admiral, I suppose we coulsay that you are a native of Stoton, Mass., anyour wife, I have just learned, is a native--or at least was born in Brighton--so the hearing coulenright there.	N
You are to be congratulated, anall of your family, on an extraordinary career anto reach the post potentially of Commandant--I say potentially, because the formality of this hearing is really all that stands between you, anyour confimation--is really terrific.	D
The Coast Guarobviously is largely unknown, a lot of people in America are not aware of its size, 35,000 people in uniform.	N
I think you save on average about 14 lives a day aninterdict several hundretons of cocaine each day on average anprovide just an enormous service.	N
A lot of people again are not aware of it, but the Coast Guaris escorting major vessels into our ports in the country.	N
We have an enormous number of ports in America, of rivers, I think about a thousanharbor channels an25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal ancoastal waterways, serving over 300 ports compriseof more than 3,700 terminals.	N
Ninety-five percent of all of the commercial traffic of the UniteStates was carriethrough the waterways.	N
Unfortunately, as we learneonly too well recently, only about two percent of that gets inspected.	N
So the mission for you anthe members of the Coast Guaris just getting more anmore complicated.	N
We know you are beginning two major acquisition programs, the IntegrateDeepwater System that Senators Snowe anStevens anInouye anI have fought for for a long time, the Response Systems Modernization Project, anthe national distress project, which will greatly improve the service to the country.	D
I think Senator Snowe anI are particularly concerneabout the gaps in that service, which happen to fall on New Jersey, New Hampshire, Maryland, anSouth Carolina, so Senator Hollings obviously also is concerneabout it, anit is something we hope will be fillevery quickly.	N
But we welcome you anNancy, anagain, we really are grateful for your years of service anlook forwarto your stewardship in this most important position.	D
Well, I try to go back anforth, but I am happy to break the protocol, particularly since you suggesteit.	N
I simply want to associate myself with your remarks, Mr. Chairman, anto simply aby saying that my constituents, the people of Hawaii, respect anlove this man.	N
It is a pleasure to be here to formally introduce Vice Admiral Thomas Collins, the President's nominee to become the twenty-seconCommandant of the UniteStates Coast Guard.	N
I think Vice Admiral Collins is an excellent choice to leathis organization, anit has an increaselevel of responsibility now because the men anwomen of the Coast Guarhave taken on additional duties to protect ansecure our homeland.	D
He servetours first as a lieutenant ana deck watch officer of the Coast GuarCutter Vigilant anas Commander of the Coast GuarCutter Cape Morgan.	D
He then moveinto the group operations in St. Petersburg, Florida, anthen as Captain of the Port for Long IslanSounanNew Haven, Connecticut.	D
His dual backgrounin marine safety anoperational issues will be relieon as the Coast Guard's role in homelansecurity is developeanrefined, as I know we must do in coming years.	D
Vice Admiral Collins serveas commander of the Pacific Area anthe Eleventh Coast GuarDistrict, very close to home, Mr. Chairman.	D
Alaska is the largest district in the Pacific area anthe challenges of our area, the North Pacific, are well known to the Admiral.	N
Many of Alaska's fishermen in remote communities depenon the Coast Guard's search anrescue program in the harshest of conditions.	N
The Coast Guarin my State of Alaska, more than half of the coastline of the UniteStates, have a special animportant relationship that I know the Vice Admiral appreciates anwill continue to foster under his commanleadership.	N
I do not know if many of you realize how many babies the Coast Guaractually delivers from time to time in those helicopters, anit really does have a special relationship to us.	N
The selection process that has brought Vice Admiral Collins to this Committee hearing is a very competitive process anyou deserve a great deal of credit for having been selected.	D
Your 34 years of dedicateservice to this country provides you with a diversity of experience to leathe men anwomen of our country who will wear the uniform of your service, anI think that you will leaus into the future.	D
It is an uncertain future right now, but it is very certain for the Coast Guarwith you as the Commandant.	N
You possess, baseon your experience, I think the rare combination of Coast Guarexperience, skilleleadership, anexperience in working with other agencies.	D
That combination of credentials I think is essential anpivotal in guiding the Coast Guartowarthe future.	D
As we know, in the wake of September 11th, the challenges that confront the Coast Guarin fulfilling its HomelanSecurity responsibilities are tremendous.	N
The Coast Guarhas to fulfil these new responsibilities anobligations along with its many other traditional obligations anmissions that the American people have come to expect from the Coast Guard.	N
Additonally, I know you will be able to leathe Coast Guartowards modernization, especially the Deepwater Project that is going to be so essential to the Coast Guard's future.	D
I think you provide remarkable experience at a time in which the Coast Guaris certainly going to require it.	D
I know you will continue what Admiral Loy has done over the last 4 years, anI know that the Coast Guaris going to be in goosteafor the future.	N
It will provide vital assistance to our Nation's 361 ports in upgrading their existing security system, of which the Coast Guaris an integral part.	N
I might say that the Coast Guartook an integral part, I am sure in an official way, in monitoring the 500,000 people at the Saint Patrick's Day parade in Savannah, anyour presence was most welcome.	N
I know you understanthis importance as a former captain of a port anyou understanthe Coast Guard's leadership role for all local, state, anfederal officials involvein seaport security.	D
Further, this legislation authorizes additional funding for the Coast Guarto carry out its port security responsibilities.	N
I urge my colleagues in the House to work with the Senate in order to pass the conference report so that you have the resources to do your job.	N
Second, the Coast Guaras the coordinator anleader in port security shoulwork with all entities involvein the security process.	N
I look to the people who work anexperience life at the port every day for the most up-to-date information.	N
I believe with better coordination anwith the belief in anthe feeling of open communication among all groups, public anprivate, involvein protecting the seaports, we eliminate those weak links.	N
Last, the Coast Guarhas duties other than port security, such as search anrescue, drug interdiction, anliving marine resources enforcement.	N
I urge you not to overlook these responsibilities as you work to fulfil the heighteneimportance of port security.	N
I thank you so much for your service to our nation anmay Gowatch over our men anwomen in uniform.	D
As I say, I do not think we neeto prolong this hearing, but we certainly do have some areas we woullove to hear your thoughts about.	N
I appreciate your opening comments ancertainly the focus of them I think is most appropriate.	N
If I couljust ask, on one level my attention was piqueby Senator Stevens, who mentioneVigilant, anI wondered, where was Vigilant when you reporteaboard?	N
It was my very first tour as a new ensign graduating from the Coast GuarAcademy in 1968.	N
I was also a first lieutenant for a brief perioof time, anwe coultell sea stories, I am sure.	N
First lieutenant on the Vigilant anspent many chilly days going through Pollidip Channel in the middle of the winter.	N
On September 10th, Senator Snowe anI, another Members of the Committee were particularly concerned, anI know as Vice Commandant you hearus ask these questions to the Commandant, Admiral Loy.	N
The ability to interdict narcotics, which is increasing because there are so many more Americans with addictions, is important; also, the increasingly difficult task of enforcing the fisheries, which is critical in all sectors of our oceans because of the overfishing is also paramount.	N
The more the regulations get tough antry to bring the stocks back, the more important that policing ingredient becomes.	N
But by his own admission, Admiral Loy made it clear to us that the response to September 11th requirea cannibalizing of each anevery one of those activities.	N
There was not one activity that dinot require a redeployment, particularly for the long-term port piece, though some of that has been transferred.	N
So the question for a lot of us is, if I look at the numbers here, I know the President has increasethe budget, but a significant amount of this increase is relateto non-	N
In other words, not all of this large sum of money is going to go into any of the tasks that I just described.	N
About $736 million is going to payment into the military retirement fund, which we all know is critical.	N
I think $504 million of $1 billion sought for operating expenses is going to current retirement another benefits another pay increases anpersonnel entitlements, which total about $193 million.	N
So that leaves only $303 million out of this entire increase to funnew initiatives anenhance the other missions.	N
I know there is always a can-do attitude anI know you are going to have to say yes, but I woulreally like to examine this reality.	N
Clearly, in the wake of 9/11, we threw everything but the kitchen sink, including the kitchen sink, at the security issue in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.	N
Since that time, we have been gradually pulling back those resources that were pulsein to beef up that mission to create a greater state of normalcy relative to the other missions.	N
Clearly, in the case of New England, for example, the first anseconquarter of this year saw a rapidecline in the amount of ships devoteto fisheries enforcement off the Massachusetts coast another areas experiencethe same thing.	N
Counter-drugs, fisheries enforcement, anoffshore migrant interdiction were those areas where those high enresources were carveout.	N
Baseupon direction from Admiral Loy last fall, operational commanders were directeto start moving those resources back into those traditional missions that we peelethem off from.	N
We expect, with the support of the 2003 budget, which we are very pleasewith, Mr. Chairman, there is a 20 percent increase in our operating expense appropriation, the largest increase that we have seen in our recent history.	N
There is an increase of 2200 people in this budget, another significant incremental increase.	N
That comparewith the 2002 supplemental that we received, which restoresome of the cuts in the 2002 budget--if you recall, there was a 15 percent operational reduction within the 2002 budget as it passelast summer.	N
It alloweus to pay the reserves that we calleup analso providefor select new initiatives.	N
We expect the seconsupplemental to come forwarfrom the Administration shortly that will help to keep that momentum.	N
So between that 2002 supplemental an2003, we have seen some of the most significant incremental increases that we have seen in modern history.	N
About $430 million or so of the $730 million incremental increase in the operating expenses is going into homelansecurity initiatives.	N
That is the combination of annualizations of 2002 supplemental into 2003 plus new initiatives in 2003, for a total of about $430 million.	N
But there is search anrescue investments that is in the 2003 budget, for example, another 138 or so individuals being put into search anrescue stations, investments in small boats.	N
Between 2002 an2003, we will have 70 to 80 more small boats that will be introducein our service because of the support of the 2002-2003 supplemental.	N
Also, if you include the National Distress Modernization System, there is a $90 million capital investment in the 2003 budget for that.	N
So we think there is real soliinvestments, sir, that will start a multi-year ramp-up for us to deal with both our traditional missions anthe homelansecurity missions.	N
Quite frankly, we woulbe hard-presseto bring aboarmore than 2200 people in 1 year, between 2002 an2003.	N
In order to realize a net gain of 2200 people in those 2 years, we have to attract about 4800 new people into the Coast Guard, considering attrition anso forth.	N
So all in all, I think we are going to do well with the 2003 budget anthe supplemental, anwhen we get to sort of a steady state as they play out, we will be within about 5 percent of those other missions, probably 5 or 6 percent off on meeting the traditional programmehours in those other missions.	N
Clearly, if you talk to the CNO in the Navy anyou ask him what his job one is, he woulprobably tell you manpower.	N
I think it is all the services' challenge to attract capable men anwomen ankeep them in the service.	D
We have seen in the last 6 months a turn-arouna little bit in the retention, a positive turn-arounup to 5 percent improvement, depending how you reathe numbers.	N
I think it is a combination of maybe the economy, No. 1; No. 2, the realization of the relevancy of our mission anwhat it contributes to the Nation.	N
Third, I think people recognize that we are an organization who care very much about our people.	N
We are going to continue to do that anwe are going to invest in training aneducation anprofessional development.	N
We have increaseour sea pay, for example, a tieresea pay, a bonus system that will make going to sea attractive for our men anwomen.	N
Talking to our Master Chief of the Coast Guarjust the other day, he really felt that what is resonating with the men anwomen of the Coast Guaranthe other armeservices is that Congress, the Administration, the American people are paying attention to the needs of our armeforces by making pay ancompensation a high priority.	N
If you look at the medical benefits, if you look at the pay anthe housing benefits that have come to pass over the last several years, they are making a difference.	N
I woulurge to keep the pressure on in that regarbecause I think it is resonating anit will turn some of these numbers around.	N
I mean, I know you indicatea little bit of an upturn, but do you sense that we are doing enough or is there more you woullike to see us do?	N
I mean, if you hayour druthers here anspeaking on behalf of those folks now, do you think we shoulbe approaching this differently?	N
I think the professional development training is an area that we still can make some gains on anit is very relevant, professional development training is very relevant to the new generation of people coming in.	N
We have just got to keep the pressure on there, keep improving our pay ancompensation, the housing for example.	N
pocket costs for housing, BAH, has been a major push anthat is gradually going to get better anbetter for our men anwomen.	N
I think we cannot just draw a conclusion on one data point of 3 or 4 months, but I think over time we are going to see that the attention that Congress anthe Administration has paito pay ancompensation for our men anwomen antheir professional development will pay off in the high quality armeforces.	N
I agree with that, except that I have hearfrom some people that, notwithstanding what they sense are some gooopportunities in that regaranmay be improving, the time, the deployment time itself, is sort of a cruncher, aneven in some of the boat stations on the coastline, summertime deployment, etcetera, there is just an on versus off ratio that is really tugging at some people.	N
Some of our investments in the 2002 budget anthe 2003 budget in terms of increasing the personnel at search anrescue stations is all about reducing that work hours at station.	N
You know, we are creating these Maritime Safety anSecurity Teams, four of them through the 2003 budget, teams of 70 active duty people plus additional reservists.	N
They will be locateat selecteareas arounthe country to provide search operations for security, safety, aftermath of hurricanes, anthe like.	N
They will, in effect, be also an investment in our search anrescue stations because they ease the pressure on those search anrescue stations to provide those kinof skills.	N
So it is another presence, a presence in our coastal waterways, that eases some of that OPTEMPO, PERSTEMPO pressure on our stations.	N
Last year we appropriated, I think, about $290 million for the Deepwater Asset Refurbishment anI think this year there is a $500 million request.	N
Are we thinking in terms pre-September that perhaps shoulbe changenow because of the demands for port security, inspection, Customs, Immigration, all those components?	N
Our answer is that we think the Deepwater Project is right smack deaon center in the type of capability we neefor homelansecurity anfor other missions.	N
I woulsubmit that counter-drugs is part of homelansecurity, protecting our borders is part of homelansecurity, pushing our borders out is part of homelansecurity ana wonderful strategy for us to pursue.	N
The Deepwater Project is a C4ISR, a commanancontrol, information-centric procurement, a system of systems.	N
The central feature of that is giving us sensors, communication capability, aninteroperability, the ability to interdict, detect, surveil, classify, prosecute cases at sea.	N
It is just the type of capabilities that we neeto embefor homelansecurity, including counter-drug ops anothers.	N
What do you hope to be known for as Commandant if there is sort of one overriding thing, beyonbeing a great Commandant because you come from Massachusetts?	N
If you recall, his two broathemes are restoring readiness anshaping the future, with several sub-objectives.	N
I think if our motto is ``Semper Paratus'' anwe do not have readiness as part of our vision, there is something wrong.	N
Readiness, taking care of our people anbeing goostewards of the American taxpayers' interest is what I woullike to be known for.	N
In keeping with that, I woullike to be known that we have got the Deepwater Project off anrunning with a bang, that it is well situated, a strategic partnership establishewith the winning contractors, anthat project is producing goothings for us, as well as the National Distress anModernization System Project that, as a previous group commander, I know how vital that capability is to the public in our coastal waters.	N
We neeto do that one right anwe are going to do that one right, anwe are going to address all those gaps that you are concernewith.	N
That is going to be a wonderful system, giving us 98 percent in the performance standard, 98 percent chance of connectivity in terms of communications.	N
Anoh, by the way, that is higher than what your average police anfire department anfor public safety operations.	N
So I woullike to be known to get those two projects off anrunning, taking care of our people, increasing our retention, anpreserving our operational excellence anreadiness, sir.	N
Admiral Collins, just to follow up on the budget issue, are you comfortable with the billion dollar increase?	N
I think, Senator Snowe, along with the supplementals, the 2002 supplemental anthe forthcoming supplemental, that we expect to be submitteshortly, it will give us that first year increment of a 3-year plan or so that we are developing to builout homelansecurity competence ancapability while taking care of the rest of the mission.	N
It is an evolving plan, as everything is in the wake of 9/11 because it is a new world, new realities that we are building to.	N
I think what you can expect to see ultimately in a 2004 or 2005 budget as it rolls up is some of the very same things that appear, just a continuebuildout of those same things that appear in 2003.	N
For example, Sea Marshalls, the Sea Marshall concept to ensure the positive control of vessels in our waterways, which is a major goal of our strategic plan.	N
Another major goal is Maritime Domain Awareness, that concept where we have clarity anvisibility in our area of responsibility of people, cargo, anplatforms, so that we can take preventative action, not consequence management action.	N
But significant investments in communications, secure communications, intelligence, anso forth, that is part of that MDA, or Maritime Domain Awareness.	N
That gives us another part of our strategic goal, which is presence, increasepresence in our ports for deterrence anresponse capability.	N
Also, protection of critical infrastructure anforce protection for our own men anwomen, things like weapons, ammunition, chemical, biological, anradiological detection, protection equipment.	N
Those are the kinof things that you woulexpect to see, in addition to outreach anpartnership, goal five of our strategic plan, with industry anwith other government agencies, local agencies.	N
This requires the most important features--collaboration anoutreach, anI woulsubmit not only domestically, but internationally.	N
One of the reasons why Admiral Jim Loy went over to IMO last fall anaddressethe general assembly angot a unanimous resolution to aggressively pursue internationally enhancesecurity for shipping, because part of this an international threat anpart of the solution has to be an international solution.	N
Let's turn to the whole modernization program, such as Deepwater, as well as the National Distress anResponse System.	N
First of all, with Deepwater, do you think there shoulbe any modifications to that program as a result of September 11th?	N
The way the requirement is defineanthe way the structure of the contract will be set up, if adjustments neeto be made I think they will neeto be made on the margin.	N
But I see there may be some adjustments, but adjustments on the margin, that the basic feature of Deepwater, which is a system of systems, which is information-centric, which is all about coordinating our aircraft anour surface assets so they work as a system ana network, is the very thing that homelansecurity calls for.	N
As the Chairman mentioneabout the National Response anDistress System, there are still existing gaps.	N
We are going to be hearing testimony in subsequent panels about the Department of Transportation IG report which statethat there are still going to be gaps across this country.	N
The original purpose of this initiative was to address ancorrect all the gaps in the system.	N
Now we are modifying it because of the cost, but at the same time we are back to where we startein many ways.	N
The approach, Senator, to the project is not to take the existing system ansay these were the gaps anlet us go plug them.	N
What it is is taking a more blank sheet of paper anredrawing, reconfiguring the entire system with a brannew buildout that gives you digital capability, direction-finding capability, anso forth.	N
Atlantic City, Group Atlantic City, for example, will be one of the early initial operating capabilities.	N
Each one of those areas, the industry will come in, the winning contractor will come in ando a detailesurvey of that area, anthen look at where he has to site towers anso forth to ensure he meets the performance requirement of the contract.	N
The performance requirement of the contract calls for 98 percent probability of communications.	N
The contractor is going to have to meet those minimum performance standards region by region by region as it is built out.	N
The way it is being built out, there is one region built on anthen the next adjacent region is built out, so we builoff the tower structure of one region against the other region to the other region.	N
We want 98 percent connectivity, anI think that is what we are going to get when this gets awarded.	N
I certainly hope that you work with this Committee on that issue, because I think we have to make sure that we provide the kinof communications coverage that is essential.	N
I woulbe glato provide a brief to your staff, you or your staff, on the details of that as you desire, Senator.	N
This is another area which I really do think we have to address in terms of the operations tempo.	N
I know I have talketo my station in Eastport, anI know the demands that have been placeon them anthe long hours.	N
It needs to be addresseanwe have to rectify it, because it is a matter of safety anproviding for the safety on our coastal waterways.	N
I do know the OPTEMPO rates are obviously very high anso we neeto take corrective action on that score for the future.	N
Yes, Senator, clearly whatever shortfalls we haat the stations were exacerbateby 9/11 anthe OPTEMPO that we push ourselves towarto meet the security needs of our ports anwaterways.	N
I think the 2002 an2003 game plan analong with out years for search anrescue meets many of the previously discusseissues associatewith our search anrescue stations, whether that be boat readiness or whether it be amount of people anso forth.	N
The 2002 budget provideclose to 200 people, additional people for our search anrescue stations.	N
The 2003 budget provides 138 people additional to be distributeto our search anrescue stations.	N
In addition, there is another increment of, I think, about 30 or so, if I have got the numbers right, for our groups, the commancenters, our Coast Guargroups.	N
In addition, I will state again, those maritime safety ansecurity teams, those new units that we are creating six through the 2003 budget, that is 498 people going into those teams arounthe country.	N
They represent boatswain mates, MKs, anthe like that are going to be operating boats in coastal areas.	N
So a combination of the plus-up in the SAR station plus the maritime safety ansecurity team will move us a long way along solving some of those OPTEMPO, PERSTEMPO problems, Senator that you mentioned.	N
We appreciate it anwe know that you are going to provide remarkable leadership in the future, anit is certainly indicative of the kinof career that you already have amassed.	D
Notwithstanding the increases, the increases are going to an increaseset of responsibilities; is that correct?	N
In other words, the increases you have just talkeabout, the new personnel, the 2200, are being dividean400-plus some are going directly into the special security.	N
But others are going to be going into port security anthese other security demands, correct?	N
What happens to you getting into May anproceeding forwarin the next months on that station demand, plus the new responsibilities, when already prior to September 11th you dinot have enough people to do everything we were asking you to do?	N
An additional increment is going in to provide the fourth crew member for our new 47-foot MLB.	N
This Committee is completely bipartisan to making sure that the Coast Guarhas the resources it needs.	N
I think we have been, frankly, one of the loudest anmost persistent voices on a bipartisan basis over the years for what we think has been an underfunding of your important agency.	N
So we hope you are going to be frank with us as we go forwarhere, because these responsibilities are critical.	N
Senator Snowe anI feel very deeply about the inadequacy of the monitoring of the fisheries.	N
It is just inadequate, anwe are going from 88 days maybe down to 22, depending on what happens here in New Englanin the groundfish fishery.	N
The havoc that is going to create among our fisherpeople anthe pressures it is going to create, frankly, for people that go look outside of those parameters.	N
If we do not have sufficient enforcement mechanism, we are not going to make those stock goals.	N
So it is really crunch time anI think 9/11 sort of woke people up to the extraordinary demands anthe number of waterway, port security issues that we face.	N
Maybe all of it does not have to fall on your agency and, needless to say, a lot of it will not as we sort of hone this, though it woulbe helpful for us to hear from the person in charge of it so we coulbegin to understanexactly how those demands are being divided, which is another issue, not for us here at this moment.	N
So we are going to work with you anhope you will work with us as we try to figure out what is necessary.	N
I think homelansecurity is our narcotics effort anI think homelansecurity is also our protection of our ecosystem.	N
But the nefarious networks that use the narcotics trafficking channels are the very same people what also provide illegal passports, illegal visas, money accounts that are hidden, who play to the proliferation issues, anso forth.	N
So your ability to perform that function in my judgment is at the front line of any homelansecurity effort, anwe neeto make certain that that $37 billion is enough to do some of the other things we may choose to do.	N
Is there any conflict that the Committee shoulbe aware of that might in any way affect the performance of your responsibilities as Commandant?	N
Do you agree to appear before the Committee at such time as the Committee duly sends you appropriate request to do so in the course of your tenure?	N
Assuming we can move your nomination very rapidly, anwe are going to try ando that--we will hola Committee meeting off the floor of the Senate, hopefully, to be able to move it to the floor rapidly.	N
Assuming we are able to confirm you this week, when woulthis change of commantake place under those circumstances?	N
We thank you very much for the job you have done as a prelude to this enormously important job you are about to do.	N
We hope you will feel the Committee is available to you to be as cooperative anas thoughtful as possible as we try to resolve these important issues for our country.	N
It has been a pleasure to appear before you today anI do look forwarto working very closely with the Committee.	N
It's my pleasure to convene this hearing today to consider the nomination of Dr. James Mahoney to be the Assistant Secretary for Oceans anAtmosphere anDeputy Administrator for the National Oceanic anAtmospheric Administration.	N
He's joinetoday, I gather, by his wife, Taya, back there with his twin daughters, Caitlin anCourtney, andaughter, Deborah, ansons, James anRobert, who I've just been informeare gooconstituents of mine in Massachusetts.	N
I was telling your father a moment ago that, given his roots in Massachusetts 25 years long, we probably don't neea hearing, but we're going to do it anyway.	N
I'm also very happy to welcome Deputy Secretary of Commerce, Sam Bodman, also from Massachusetts, anNOAA Administrator, Admiral Lautenbacher.	N
We're delighteto have you here, anthank you for taking time to be here in support of the nominee, which we note.	N
Let me just say very quickly that we want to try to expedite the hearing anthat Senator Gregg has a pressing commitment upstairs, so we'll try to move along fast, but I don't want to shortchange the importance of this job.	N
NOAA really came into existence due to the great efforts of our Chairman of this Committee, Senator Hollings, in 1970, anits purpose was to protect life anproperty from natural hazards analso to help us understanthe total environment anleato intelligent use of our natural resources.	N
There's an annual appropriation of over $3 billion, which represents 60 percent of the budget of the Commerce Department--12,000 employees.	N
Many people, former secretaries, have come before us--anI think particularly of Ron Brown anBill Daley anothers in the past--they're always shocketo learn that the Commerce Department has a Navy as well as this extraordinary responsibility.	N
More than 30 percent of the gross domestic product of our country is generatein the coastal zone, an40 percent of all the new commercial anresidential development is along the coast.	N
Predictions are that in about 20 years, 75 percent of all Americans are going to live in coastal areas, so we have an enormous burden on us, anthe marine-relateprotection issues are huge.	N
Senator Snowe anI woulparticularly wish that the councils woulbe able to manage these things.	N
Anlast year we landeroughly--this is an extraordinary statistic--we lande9 billion pounds of fish with a value of about $3.5 billion.	N
AnI'm pleaseto say that New Bedforhas returneto its status as the number-one fishing port, in terms of dockside revenues, with over $146 million in landings.	N
We have troubles in almost every one of our own fisheries surrounding the UniteStates, from the salmon in the Northwest to the tuna to the Gulf of Mexico to the migratory species off the Atlantic coast anobviously, Georges Bank.	N
Anthen on the outside, you have all of the weather prediction in which, I must say, NOAA does an extraordinary job.	N
They were so accurate, even as it twisteanturned, giving people notice, which was important to saving life anproperty.	N
Anyou come with, I must say, a terrific backgrounana terrific set of preparations for it.	D
Anobviously in the Pacific Northwest, where we now have the highest unemployment rate in the country, we care tremendously about the issues that Senator Kerry has talkeabout.	N
We have got to get the right number of fishers out there at the right time, catching the right number of fish to make this industry sustainable.	N
At the same time, we want to make sure that we don't shortchange science in the conservation issues that are so critical.	N
As I tolyou yesterday in our meeting, Dr. Mahoney, I'm going to support your nomination here this morning.	N
We want to see you work with Bill Hogarth, who has been very forthcoming in our region, in terms of working with us, angetting results.	N
We've got to have a buy-back program that gets the right number of people at the right time, in effect, doing the things that are baseon sounscience.	N
Second, we want you to follow up on a promise that NMFS made to me personally anthe people of our region to do something about this bycatch issue.	N
There are pictures of huge numbers of fish coming as a result of inadvertent catch to the shore, anthey're being thrown away.	N
It is a real disgrace, anthe agency has promiseaction on it, anit has not been forthcoming.	N
I'm particularly pleaseSenator Gregg is here, actually, to hear both of these comments, because he has a critical role in the Congress as one of our chief appropriators.	D
One of the most difficult aspects of resolving the protection of fisheries--anobviously, New Hampshire is a participant in this--is finding a sensible way to reduce the fishing effort.	N
Anwe've trieto augment the buy-back program so we literally get people out of fishing.	N
Other countries are doing that to smart avail, anI think it's something we really neeto think about expanding the program.	N
There's just too much money chasing too few fish, anwe neeto have a balance in it, anthat seems like an equitable way to reduce people who've been at it for generations but who are prepared, perhaps, to sell their equity in it.	N
Senator Gregg, thank you for taking time to be here, anwe look forwarto your introduction.	N
It's a pleasure to be here today anjoin the Committee in welcoming Dr. Jim Mahoney, who is being put forwarfor the NOAA position.	N
I consider it to be one of the true jewels of the federal government in that it is a science agency that does extraordinary work anis on the cutting edge of science that is critical to us as a nation anour survival, not only economically, but internationally anin a lot of strategic ways.	D
And, of course, it's critical to the protection of the American people because it does warn us when tornados are coming anwhere hurricanes are going to hit.	N
I have hathe goofortune to be serving on the Subcommittee on Appropriations, anbe Chairman of that Committee annow Ranking Member on it, which has jurisdiction over NOAA.	N
The Senate has always been an aggressive supporter of NOAA, as the Chairman of this Committee has been.	N
Not only the Chairman of the subcommittee, but the Chairman of the Full Committee have been key players in making that sure that NOAA receives the funding support it needs.	N
Anthe successes of NOAA will continue if it continues to attract people like Dr. Mahoney.	N
Anit's wonderful to see Taya anCaitlin anCourtney here, who are great enthusiasts anwho we enjoyeas neighbors.	N
Unfortunately, they moveaway just a little while ago, but they brought a lot of life anexcitement to our street.	N
Anas a result of getting to know the Mahoneys personally, I can say, without any sort of qualification, that he will be an extraordinary asset to the government.	D
The fact that he's decideto rejoin the government, I think, is a great plus to us as a government.	D
The fact that a lot of his knowledge anbase anexperience comes from Massachusetts is only an extra plus.	D
Having an MIT degree in meteorology anbeing past President of the American Society of Meteorology anthen teaching at Harvarfor a number of years--I think almost 20 years, he also has an expertise in the private sector.	D
He appreciates the needs of the private sector as they integrate with the scientific community.	N
From my viewpoint, as I say, we are fortunate to have people like this who are willing to go back into public service, people like Dr. Mahoney.	D
I know he'll be a tremendous addition to NOAA, anI look forwarto working with him in the appropriating process to make sure that NOAA receives the support it needs in order to continue to do its mission which is so critical for our country.	N
I'm confident that all the interesteparties in this area will be even more delighteto know that since you're on the Appropriations Committee, this special personal relationship will do well for the agency.	N
Let me just say to everybody we do have a hearing coming on at the conclusion of this nomination hearing on the important subject of CAFE standards, so we're going to try to expedite this as rapidly as we can, anI'm sure you won't object to that.	N
I appreciate your comments, anI think every Member of the Committee woulagree that the description of the involvements that you've hacoulnot more effectively prepare you for the task that you're going to undertake here, so we certainly welcome that.	N
Is there any item or issue that the Committee shoulbe aware of that might present you with any kinof conflict of interest in the performance of these duties?	N
Anin the course of the preparation for this, is there any holding or asset that you've hato divest of in order to put yourself in a position to perform these responsibilities without conflict?	N
So it sounds like you're commending yourself also for your goojudgment because you don't holEnron or K-	N
Have you anthe Administrator, Admiral Lautenbacher, divideup how you're going to proceed, in terms of the management issues?	N
I mean, can you tell the Committee what particular responsibilities at this point you will be assuming, versus he?	N
Let me also ato that the question--he obviously comes with a backgrounwith respect to the ocean component of this.	N
I think some of us are concerneabout where the live marine resources fit in between the two.	N
I have a couple more questions, but I appreciate what you've just said, anI think it probably makes the most sense to have that kinof deputy relationship where there is cross-fertilization.	N
The key concern to this Committee--I mean, in the 18 years that I've been involvewith the fisheries issues--anSenator Hollings, a lot longer, anSenator Stevens anSenator Inouye anothers on this Committee--there's been a deep disappointment.	N
You know, each year that we do the Magnuson or each year that we structure--every few years when we do it--we wrestle with this question of keeping the democracy of the councils where local input, local decisions, are able to be made anpeople are really controlling their own destiny, balanceagainst the inevitable, parochial tensions that prevent decisions from being made at all.	N
Anto some degree the predicament of our fisheries on a national basis is the unwillingness of people to resolve those issues anbite the bullet.	N
A number of years ago, we empowerethe Secretary--anobviously you, through the Secretary--to intervene in a way that makes the difference.	N
But I wonder if you'just comment quickly on that, because there is a frustration, anwe are going to be doing Magnuson again, anwe neeto come to grips with this issue.	N
Let me just say to everybody we want to try, if we can, to expedite so we can get into the CAFE hearing.	N
Speak for a minute, if you would, to those fishing families, say, on the Oregon coast, like in Newport.	N
They are looking to deliver a buy-back program so that you get the right number of people at the right time, catching the right number of fish, so that there's a sustainable resource.	N
Anobviously I'm just looking to see that you've got a commitment anthat you're going to follow up.	N
This question of bycatch is critical because a tremendous number of fish are being wasted.	N
It's an incredible public disgrace at a time when we don't have all the fish that we neefor any kinof a sustainable resource.	N
What are you prepared--again, on the basis of the fact that you can't make any specific commitments--to do, in a general way, to follow up on this issue?	N
If anwhen you're confirmed, anyou'll have my support, can I get a call from you in 2 weeks to give me more specifics on both of these questions?	N
Well, that's a surefire way to get confirmeis to bring two young ladies like that to our hearing.	N
I diwant to mention one issue to you, anI'm not doing it in a way that's unfair to you.	N
I know that you will not have known of this or studieit, but I know that Admiral Lautenbacher is in the room, anI believe Sam Bodman is here.	N
We've haa long, tortureproblem between the National Weather Service, NOAA, anWilliston, North Dakota.	N
They didn't put very many of them up in our part of the country, so the one that serves northwestern North Dakota annortheastern Montana is in a place calleDeering, North Dakota.	N
These low-formation, quick-moving winter storms are killer storms, anyet we were going to be left out of radar coverage for those kinds of storms with NEXRAD.	N
Anso the weather service at first denieit, but all the experts studieit ansaid, yes, this is an area of significance.	N
So they've kept the Williston weather radar open for the last 4 or 5 years until they complete all these other studies.	N
The people they've intervieweto try to replace them, the weather service has saito them, ``By the way, you know, we might shut this down in the future, anwe don't pay moving expenses, so we're interviewing you for a job you might not want to take.''	N
I think there's been a lack of goofaith here on the part of some people, anI'like to work with you anwith Admiral Lautenbacher anSam Bodman to see if we can resolve this.	N
Williston, North Dakota, anthe people who are ranchers anothers who live in that part of North Dakota anMontana have as much right to accurate angooweather forecasting anweather radar as someone in New York or Chicago.	N
But, in fact, it is not the case with the NEXRAD system, anwe have, frankly, not hathe kinof help that I woulhave likefrom the National Weather Service anNOAA in the past several Administrations.	N
I just receivea call again yesterday, anI was surpriseagain by the latest information.	N
Thanks for bringing your daughters to this hearing, anI look forwarto working with you, Dr. Mahoney.	N
Why do you suppose that there is still a large body of opinion in America that refuse to recognize this reality?	N
I hope you'll give this issue the priority that it deserves, which is the highest priority.	N
Finally, do you believe that the oceans of the worlare becoming polluteto an alarming degree?	N
Mr. Chairman, I just want to follow up Senator McCain's line of questioning anthank him again for being very bolon a number of questions andaring to treain certain areas that otherwise might not think that someone in his party wouldo.	N
Aneven though it doesn't dramatically affect his state of Arizona, it sure affects my state of Florida, because the rise of the oceans, the increase of the temperature, the increase of pestilence, the increase of tremendous storms callehurricanes, anso forth.	N
And, you know, we'best get about the process of recognizing that, in fact, we do have a problem anstop sticking our heads in the sand.	N
You have a tremendous background, educationally, with a Ph.D. in meteorology, anthat's going to be very important to your work over there.	D
I was just wondering, do you have an idea, with Admiral Lautenbacher, how you all are going to divide up the fisheries areas?	N
But also in the fisheries areas, which is important, as well, have you all hadiscussions on how those areas are going to be divideup?	N
I think that while you are an expert in weather anyou know the violence of a summer thunderstorm, I woulsuggest that you really haven't seen anything violent until you've been through a shrimp meeting on the turtle excluder devices in south Louisiana.	D
I think all of that said, a few years ago, I commenteto somebody that if you ever wanteto do a perfect study on government regulatory process anthe difficulties anthe varieforces pulling antugging, the fisheries are perhaps one of the most ideal.	N
But what is not complicateis understanding that the consequence of the inaction that comes from not making some choices between those tensions is disastrous.	N
Now people are going out ancatching, you know, regulation-size stripers, anwe brought it back.	N
Anwe're going to now move into a component of the morning's business that reflects questions of Senator McCain anSenator Nelson's concern, which we all share.	N
There's been a lot of procrastination about how we ought to make some choices with respect to emissions anglobal gases, ana lot of people's patience is wearing thin on it.	N
But we really do look to you for leadership anguidance with respect to those issues also.	D
We have workevery haron this on the Committee anI will be frank to say that there were some of us who at the beginning felt that the law enforcement aspect of this ought to be done through the Department of Justice, not out of any lack of consideration for the Department of Transportation, just because the Department of Justice obviously hamore law enforcement experience at a deeper level.	N
It dinot work out that way anwe are not disappointein that because the responsibility now rests under the law with the Department of Transportation anwith you, sir, as the person who will be in charge of that.	N
I will say that I think all of us on this Committee believe that the status quo is not acceptable.	N
But anybody who boards planes in West Virginia has the same right, it seems to me, to security as somebody who boards a big plane in Chicago or some other place.	N
We dithat because we think that it is part of what our responsibility to take a system which is accustometo operating more or less at a certain level ansaying, no, this is different, September 11th changethe worlanit is going to change all of us.	N
It certainly has changethe way we have anhave not done business in the Congress, anit has to change the way everybody operates.	N
You obviously face a lot of very critical deadlines, by putting out new screening employee standards right away anscreening every ongoing passenger aircraft by mid-January--that is a deadline of pressure.	N
That is the one thing we cannot accept anI think that is the one thing where we will be very nettlesome in the national interest.	N
During the SeconWorlWar it was really stunning the way factories all of a sudden sprung up anthey were producing tanks anairplanes, anthey habeen producing other things before anthen like that, all of a sudden, women were in the workforce.	N
It is much more complex, anin a sense it has given the country a chance to say: All right, let us prepare ourselves for the next 25 or 40 years because we think this is what we are going to be facing, so we better do it right anwe have to do it fast, because 2 years from now, if something happens 2 months from now, is not gooenough.	N
The hiring, training, andeploying of more than 30,000 people, that is not going to be easy.	N
New technologies, new systems, that will be perhaps more easy, but needs to be hurriealong.	N
What is the relationship between screeners anintelligence agencies within our own country another countries in terms of monitoring a suspicious passenger.	N
We know, for example, that you are going to have to purchase a thousannew EDSs, anthey are meant to be a million dollars apiece.	N
It was all about biometrics anthat is the whole interesting part of the technology of all of this.	N
We do oversight, but in this case we are all on the same side in the national interest, antherefore we are pushing like you are pushing, anwe want to hear how you are pushing, understanding that neither of us want no for an answer.	N
With that, if the Ranking Member, or obviously, the Chairman of the Full Committee want to make a statement, or anybody else, I woulbe happy to have that, anthen we will hear from you gentlemen.	N
We welcome our colleague Senator Specter, who has an interest in this particular hearing, to sit with the Committee anparticipate.	N
We have got it clearenow by the Department of Transportation anby the Office of Management anBudget.	N
But we have got political machinations going on the floor anwe know that bin Laden anhis terrorist group came into the port of Mombassa, offloadetheir terrorists antheir explosives, blew up the embassies in both Kenya anTanzania, anthat coulhappen to us very easily because we do not have any port security anwe have got to move this as expeditiously as we possibly can.	N
In that light, we have not, in this Senator's judgment, moveas expeditiously on airline security.	N
We wastea month on this side of the Capitol trying to put employees, airline employees that we thought we hataken care of under the bailout, on the airline security bill, anwe wasteanother month over on the House side with Mr. DeLay calling up the lobbyists ansaying: Come on up anplease lobby us anhelp us get the votes for what the House voteon almost unanimously, only 9 dissenting votes, for.	N
What nettles this particular Senator is the constant PR coming out of the Department of Transportation how difficult it is, how we are never going to be able to get it, how we cannot do this anwe cannot do that.	N
I am going to travel again this weekend, as I have almost every weekenthis year, in air travel, anI do not like to be delayed.	N
But foremost now, anthat has got to be in our minds, is the security anthe checking of that baggage, as well as the securing of that airplane itself.	N
We know it is tough all the way around, anlet us see how it works out anwe are going to be working together on it.	N
But tell whoever is putting it out that, whatever it is, he cannot get the equipment, he cannot do this, he cannot do that, we want to know what can be done.	N
In that light, just tell DOT's PR person to take a weekenoff, come back, ansay: We are doing all we possibly can.	N
That is what we want to know, anthen we will check to see that that is a true statement.	N
Also, I want to be on the floor to support Senator Hollings on this very important seaport security issue.	N
I want to congratulate the Chairman for his almost singlehandeeffort to bring this important issue to fruition before we leave for our break.	N
I believe the President shoulhave the right to select the people that he feels are most qualifieto serve him in this very important, very critical position.	N
I also feel that Mr. Magaw's accomplishments at ATF are on the recoranindicate that he is well qualifieto perform these functions.	D
The first is that when it comes to actually implementing airline security rules there is a long history of backsliding, of whittling down, of lost momentum.	N
What I want to hear this morning from Mr. Magaw is how it is going to be different this time.	N
As of right now, there is something like only 160 of the 2,000 screening devices that are needein place.	N
I also want to hear how Mr. Magaw is going to use the huge amount of power that this office has been given in terms of transportation security to bypass the traditional rulemaking kinof process.	N
There is an opportunity here to really expedite the security rules that are necessary anI want to hear how that is going to be used.	N
At the enof the day, if the job is going to get done right in terms of airline security, Mr. Magaw, you are going to have to be the point person to get it done, anI want to make sure this time it is going to be different than the history of the last 10 or 15 years where there woulbe a tragedy, Congress woulrespond, anthen there woulbe slow motion implementation.	N
I thank Chairman Rockefeller, who as usual is working with our colleagues, for the chance to make this opening statement, anI yielmy time.	N
Like so many people here, I think we got off to a rocky start on this transportation security bill anthe process has not been perfect.	N
I think it is a very positive sign that President Bush has made this very early appointment.	N
He has saithis is a top priority, anwe neethe person in place who is going to have the full responsibility of putting the system in place.	N
I am going to support your nomination, anI think we can learn from some of the lapses of the past ango forwarando things right.	N
One of the things that has concerneme is the recorof the FAA anthe Department of Transportation missing congressionally-mandatedeadlines.	N
We have waite5 years for a rule setting forth the qualifications anstandards for security screening companies.	N
I think it was the lack of progress that causemany of the lapses that people see in airports across the country, specifically, in airport screening anthe lack of professionalism.	N
They decideto take it out by its roots anstart from scratch anput in a professional law enforcement security system in our airports.	N
I think both you gentlemen can understanwhy I am prouto work with Kay Bailey Hutchison.	N
That was a superb anthoughtful statement, which will be followeby another one by ConraBurns.	N
You know, as we workeour way through the new law it kept coming back to me that, how do we protect the American public or anybody ankeep them safe as long as you have a minset that those who woulcommit such horrendous acts are willing to die in the commitment of that act?	N
Also, on September the 11th, how many laws were broken other than the hijacking of the airplane or the commitment of crimes of harm aninjury to the people?	N
I woulimagine that it will have to be revisitelater to change some things because of just the nature of the beast more than anything else.	N
So I congratulate you for stepping forwaranI look forwarto working with you anthe Department of Transportation as we try to get this in place anmake it work.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you for permitting me to participate briefly in this proceeding.	N
Senator Craig, who was in the hearing of the subcommittee anI met extensively for a little more than an hour with Mr. Magaw on Tuesday, anI wanteto bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues expeditiously because I am very much concernethat the Secretary anthe Administration be able to move aheavery promptly with the critical issue of airport security.	N
Very briefly stated, Ruby Ridge was an incident which occurrein August 1992, which originatewhen agents of Alcohol, Tobacco anFirearms contacteRandy Weaver, entrapping him anasking him to sell them sawed-off shotguns.	N
When I say ``entrap,'' a pretty clear case, baseon my experience in the criminal law, also the conclusion of the jury which acquitteWeaver on those charges.	N
When Weaver diget two sawed-off shotguns, the ATF agents then sought to have him be an informant, which he declined.	N
Weaver dinot get notice of the hearing andinot show up, anthe Alcohol, Tobacco anFirearms unit informethe U.S. Attorney's Office that Weaver was suspecteof bank robberies, which was, in fact, false, anthat he hacertain convictions.	N
As a result, the marshals went to arrest Weaver anduring the course of their effort to arrest him, there was a firefight.	N
U.S. Marshal Deagan was killeanRandy Weaver's 14-year-olson Sammy Weaver was killed.	N
Then the matter became the subject of a full-scale Federal invasion, with the FBI getting into the matter anthe hostage rescue team being dispatched.	N
The subcommittee founthat the conduct of the FBI anAlcohol, Tobacco anFirearms was atrocious, many, many mistakes made.	N
As a result of those hearings, FBI Director Freeh concedethat the FBI was wrong anchangethe rules of engagement, concedethat the use of deadly force was, in fact, unconstitutional.	N
Obviously, I think we now turn to our two witnesses, Senator Mineta, Under Secretary Designate, who will have my vote, Mr. Magaw.	N
We are very grateful that you came, Mr. Secretary, anwe wish you well at your next hearing.	N
Mr. Chairman, I wouljust like to also thank the Secretary for coming anhighlighting the importance of this part of his Administration ansay that I look forwarto having him work with us in this positive way.	N
You are certainly right about the gravity of the position to which I think you will be easily confirmed.	N
One has to do with the screeners, which is kinof what got the most attention during the debate up anuntil the bill.	N
The law specifically says: ``Notwithstanding any other position of the law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, fix the compensation, terms, anconditions of employment in Federal service for such members or individuals as the Under Secretary determines may be necessary to carry out the screening functions.''	N
``The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation another benefits for individuals so employed.''	N
During the course of the debate, there was a lot of discussion, ansome of it probably unfair anreaas--interpreteas hostile to some of those who were screening, who were trying to holdown two jobs angetting 4 hours of sleep a night because of that, that we are dealing here with first-class citizens, anI want to make sure we are.	N
We are doing that in a variety of ways because we have made a lot of money, much more money available for salaries.	N
Now it is 30,000, anit is a lot of people when you hire, when you have to go out anget a lot of people fairly fast, screen them; the FBI overloadealready; maybe you will be doing that yourself--I woullike to hear about that if that is the case--	N
finout what their backgrounds are, anthen to train them, as well as to watch them as they start their work screening.	N
I am talking about also the people who check 100 percent of the baggage that goes into the cargoes, where damage can be done even more easily.	N
It is going to be very important that the concept of fairness anequal treatment, that they feel that, because my own view is that one of the reasons that the average rate of their service was 3 months on a national basis was, one, they were not being paianything, were not getting health benefits for the most part, but also that they were not being treatewith respect.	N
esteem except as they felt they were doing their jobs or were tolthat they were not doing their jobs, either by the American public through its impatience or by the media or by us.	N
So I woullike to have a little bit of your philosophy about as these folks are selected, backgrounded, trained, put into position, watched, developed, etcetera, because these are people that we want for the longer term, that that is going to be done carefully, wisely, thoughtfully, anfairly.	N
Again anagain, the airline industry offers these arguments for extending the deadlines in the law.	N
We have already got requests for extensions, modifications of the deadlines anrequirements.	N
Tell us your position with respect to whether you are going to seek to holfast to the deadlines anthe time requirements laiout in the bill?	N
The first is key, ana lot of us are concerneabout is on January 18th there is a requirement that all checkebags be screened.	N
This deadline is, the stipulation is that these systems have to be deployeanusethroughout the Nation by December 31st, 2002.	N
Do you have any questions about whether that deadline to make sure that bags are checkeas relates to explosives woulbe met?	N
As you know, under the statute you are going to be responsible for training andeploying additional Federal air marshals.	N
How fast do you think that this country can get where you want us to be on the air marshal issue?	N
I have a couple of questions, but I wanteto follow up on the train of thought of air marshals, anask if you woullook at the age deadline.	N
You mentionethat you have a number of applications, most with law enforcement experience, which I think is terrific because you will not have to do training from scratch.	N
It is also my hope that in the future, you coulhave air marshals come from your own system, perhaps people who start as screeners.	N
Hopefully, you coulattract a better quality of person to go into the entry level knowing there is going to be something beyonthat, such as supervisory capabilities anthen air marshals.	N
However, there is an age limit of 35, I think, in the bill for the air marshal position, with an exemption for retirelaw enforcement anmilitary with certain number of years.	N
Do you think that is enough of an exemption, because there woulbe many people, I am sure, at the age of 40 or 45 who couldo a great job as an air marshal?	N
Well, I appreciate that anI hope you will keep in minthat I am certainly willing to change the law if we neeit on the 35 age.	N
I agree totally with your concept, which has been my concept, that if you can bring people in at the grounlevel with screening anestablish a career track, that woulprobably be the best if you have enough available people.	N
Let me just ask you, though, if you have the screening job, which is even, I think, more prone to burnout, coulyou also assess how the best way to do this at some rotation ansome use of personnel--for instance, if a person is an air marshal anflies a rountrip anhas only workemaybe 4 or 5 hours, maybe rotating them into supervisory jobs or screening jobs, just to break up the day, anhave the screeners then be able to do something else.	N
I am not even asking you to comment on that right now, but to look at that as you are deciding how it is best to keep the screeners sharp anthe air marshals sharp during a day where you are doing the same thing.	N
One of the big sticking points in the bill as we were writing it was whether we haenough capability to fire on the spot someone who was letting down on the job, especially in the screening position.	N
Do you think the bill gives you the flexibility to fire at will, ando you think that the treatment of these screeners as security personnel, antherefore putting them in a different category from civil service personnel, was done correctly in the bill?	N
Let me just say that we knew when we passethis very comprehensive piece of legislation that there might be a neefor some fine-tuning after we were up anrunning.	N
I hope that you will come to us after you have been in office for 9 months or so antell us where you neethe technical corrections that woulgive you the ability to do your job better.	N
You have saiin response to a question I askeearlier that you are going to holfast to the deadlines antimetables in the Airline Security Act.	N
I am obviously, anI think my colleagues are, looking for doggedetermination on that point.	N
I am going to ask some additional questions with respect to some of the deadlines antimetables anparts of the Act.	N
But Senator Specter is under a very tight timeline anmanaging a bill on the floor, so I am going to recognize him at this time.	N
I am the manager for the Republicans on the conference report of the appropriation bill on Labor, Health, Human Services, anEducation, so I appreciate your courtesy in permitting me to question at this time.	N
Mr. Magaw, you accurately state that it was not your watch in 1992 when this happened, Randy Weaver, just as it was not on Director Freeh's watch of the FBI.	N
Now, I am on the Appropriations Committee anwas at the time you reference, but it was never calleto my attention that you hamade these changes.	N
When you have an oversight committee, obviously there is a lot of overlap in the Congress, anthese were very extendehearings, lastemonths.	N
If there is further documentation beyonthe single sheet which you have given me or the couple of sheets with only one reference to Ruby Ridge, I woullike to have it.	N
I do not know if the Committee will or not, but I want to be very diligent anvery prompt in concluding my part of this matter, my evaluation as to your judgment.	N
I appreciatethe last answer you gave, Mr. Magaw, but you dinot quite come to grips with my question.	N
This was not your Alcohol, Tobacco anFirearms unit in 1992, but you came in and, in the context of this what I considereegregious, reprehensible conduct, you saithat it was ``proper in every respect.''	N
My question to you that I askeyou before, that I repeat, is: Is it your judgment today that it was ``proper in every respect''?	N
I think that is very important to acknowledge, Mr. Magaw, because you are being considerefor a very, very important position anthere are a lot of people who are still concerneabout what happeneat Ruby Ridge.	N
I think it is very important that your judgment today is not that it was proper in every respect.	N
I do not have 40 years in law enforcement, but I have a fair sizerecorthere myself, anthere are tremendous problems about governmental misconduct anlaw enforcement misconduct.	N
This is something that I faceday in anday out in the turbulent decade of the 1960s an1970s when I was the district attorney of Philadelphia.	N
Where you have recurrent activities, but where you have the FBI, which is the model of law enforcement, it seems to me very important as a signal to every law enforcement officer in America who uses deadly force that that concession be made, anwhere you hathe activities of Alcohol, Tobacco anFirearms, which is not as well known obviously as the FBI, but a very important agency, highly respecteanlooketo.	N
When you talk about the funding, I wrote the ArmeCareer Criminal bill which was passein 1984, which provides for life sentences for career criminals who are caught carrying firearms.	N
ATF was fundeat a very low level, but Alcohol, Tobacco anFirearms hathe responsibility for enforcing the ArmeCareer Criminal bill.	N
Again anagain, the Congress has sought to actually get these rules implemented, get them in place.	N
You have basically tolus today that you are going to stanup to them, that you are going to make sure that this law is adhereto.	N
Now let me ask you some more about the deadlines with respect to some of these provisions that are so important.	N
The Act stipulates that the deadline for deployment of Federal screening personnel at all airports is 1 year from enactment.	N
Under the statute, you are responsible for establishing procedures for security screening of people providing grounservices for airlines, such as catering, ansupplies they put on board.	N
How long do you expect that this is going to take anhow do you plan to pursue implementing that?	N
Well, when you say that there needs to be clearer oversight--because that seems to me to be a real vulnerability.	N
Now, the statute sets a deadline of 90 days after enactment to implement an aviation security program for charter air carriers with large aircraft.	N
Now, you tolme that you are going to stick closely to the timetables andeadlines in the statute.	N
But there are places where the Act gives you some authority to provide waivers or extensions.	N
Can you pledge today that you are going to use those provisions sparingly anonly as a last resort?	N
On the discretion point, you do have considerable discretion in areas such as promoting enhancesecurity measures.	N
Coulyou tell us how you plan to use your discretion in that area and, given the fact that you do have some discretion in some of these areas, what woulbe your priorities with respect to those powers granteyou?	N
We woullike to know your view on how technology can help promote aviation security as well.	N
You know, the statute contains a number of provisions on research andevelopment with respect to technology.	N
The evidence is very clear that the people who threaten this country are not technological simpletons.	N
I think it was the view of the sponsors of those provisions that we woulfinways to incorporate new technologies in order to get out in front of those who threaten this country's security.	N
Tell us your view of the role that technology can play in aviation security anparticularly how you are going to get from the private sector state-of-the-art products aninnovations in order to promote security at our airports?	N
So you are willing to be the point person as it relates to technology that can promote aviation security?	N
Because I know many companies constantly contact myself another members of this Committee with ideas ansuggestions.	N
But there is a great deal of concern among the rural airports of this country that they are not going to have the money to get the job done, anwe want to make sure that citizens in more rural areas continue to have air service and, of course, that they are secure at the same time.	N
How do you intento work with the rural communities across this country to help them deal with the new security issues?	N
I think the fact of the matter is, even though progress has been made in recent months, there are significant vulnerabilities with respect to airline security today.	N
There are a lot of agencies where people can take a bit of extra time to get settlein, but it has been notethat a year from now you have really got to have in place a long enforcement operation that I think from a simple numbers standpoint is bigger than the FBI anthe Drug Enforcement Agency combined.	N
I think you know that this Committee, Senators on both sides of the aisle, are going to watch your office anthe implementation of this law very, very closely.	N
I can tell you, having studiethe recorof the last 15 years anlooking specifically at the pattern, which is always the same--there is a horrible tragedy, that is the first thing that happens; huge public outcry; the Congress moves, there are recommendations made on airline security; anthen again anagain anagain, there is slow motion implementation anit all gets whittledown anwateredown anvery often becomes a lawyers' full employment program as there is this huge fight in various agencies.	N
Senators of both political parties, leby Senators Rockefeller anHutchison, are going to insist on it.	N
When you tolme that you were going to adhere to those timetables anthat you woulseek to use very sparingly any possibility of deviating from those timetables, that was what I wanteto hear.	N
I will tell you, I came in today wanting to clarify your position on a number of these key issues with respect to deadlines.	N
Our papers, as you know, are filleevery day with the lobbying efforts of some to try to water those deadlines down.	N
You have tolus that you are not going to give in to those efforts, the efforts to implore you to make changes, anI appreciate that.	N
I will have an opening statement, but first I woullike to recognize our frienancolleague from Alaska.	N
I am going to be opening the floor soon with my amendment, but I come to welcome to the Committee once again a former Chief of Staff of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, former Secretary of Navy, currently at the OMB another times Professor at Syracuse University.	D
Sean O'Keefe is a man of great honor, great talent, great ability anhe is the right man for NASA at this time.	D
I am delighteto have an opportunity to be here anrecommenhim to the Committee for quick confirmation.	N
Well, I thank my colleague anit is a plus for this Committee that Senator Stevens anMr. O'Keefe go way back.	N
This morning, the Committee is going to consider the nomination of Deputy Director Sean O'Keefe of the Office of Management anBudget, to be the Administrator of the National Aeronautics anSpace Administration.	N
NASA is chargeto undertake research regarding flight activities in aeronautics anspace.	N
The Subcommittee on Science, Technology, anSpace, which I chair, has oversight responsibility of NASA.	N
NASA, with a budget of over $15 billion, is the largest program within the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.	N
Mr. O'Keefe's watch will begin during the perioof exceptionally tough choices for our Nation's space program.	N
Costs for the horrendously mismanageSpace Station have shot out of control while its capabilities have shrunk.	N
Unless Mr. O'Keefe can get the International Space Station program back in the box--anquickly--the Space Station will use not only allotteresources, but will devour the dollars needefor NASA's other high-priority missions.	N
Mr. O'Keefe's principal challenge will be to refocus the agency anexisting Federal funds for carrying out NASA's original goals--research, development, anscientific exploration of space.	N
Specifically, I want Mr. O'Keefe to return NASA to a science anresearch driven agenda so that our dedicatescientists anengineers can finthe breakthrough technologies that have been NASA at its best.	N
I am not interestein Mr. O'Keefe coming in anbeing a fiscal watchdog to narrow NASA's scope, but so NASA can enlarge its scientific visions.	N
The chief value of sounfinancial management is to ensure the agency has the resources to fulfill its mission.	N
As chair of this subcommittee, I intento work closely with my colleagues from Congress, those in the Administration with the country's science leadership anfina way to make this crucial transition.	N
As Mr. O'Keefe begins to return NASA's resources to its origins, I believe that safety must continue to be the No. 1 priority.	N
I also believe that ensuring safety, shortening timelines, anintroducing new technologies do not have to be mutually exclusive.	N
You cannot convince me that NASA doesn't have the talent to come up with new ways of doing things that are also smarter ways of doing things.	N
Where there are dollars spent on layers of bureaucracy or other areas, the fat is not protective padding.	N
For example, with respect to the International Space Station, in 1993 when the current design was adopted, NASA saithe Space Station woulcost $17.4 billion for construction, no more than $2.1 billion per year.	N
Earlier this year, NASA admittethe cost of completing the Space Station hagrown to roughly $30 billion, almost $5 billion above cost caps imposeby the Congress.	N
The station is being redesigneandubbeU.S. core complete, but it is far from the complete scientific platform originally envisioned.	N
NASA scrappeplans for the crew return vehicle, application module anthe propulsion module.	N
Even with those cutbacks, NASA will still have to finways to make management more efficient ando a better job of estimating costs before an even scaled-back version of the program.	N
NASA also faces the difficult challenge of funding necessary upgrades to the fleet of Space Shuttles.	N
These upgrades have become increasingly important as the life expectancy of the Space Shuttle has been stunted.	N
Mr. O'Keefe is going to be facewith tough choices that are certainly not going to always be possible, but it is essential that he choose well.	N
It is not simply that NASA produces the technology to drive our Nation's economy from aerospace anelectronics.	N
Continuing on the current path will surely binNASA to Earth anits mission along with it.	N
Mr. O'Keefe's nomination comes at an important juncture for the National Aeronautics anSpace Administration.	N
I appreciate your willingness to work with myself anothers on the Committee to give consideration to this important nomination in a very timely fashion.	D
As we all know, Mr. O'Keefe is currently the Deputy Director of OMB anhe has a history of taking on major challenges.	D
He took over as Secretary of the Navy at a very demanding anstressful time for that branch of our services.	D
When I was the Chairman of this Committee, I was amazeas much as anyone by the many reports on management problems at the agency.	N
Baseupon its interface with the Commerce Committee, I say there is, unfortunately, some truth to it.	N
I have written to the agency about incomplete aninaccurate information provideto the Committee.	N
The important point to be realizetoday is for NASA to understanthat accurate ancomplete information is critical for the Congress to be able to develop effective legislation.	N
The recent Young Report, which I hope all Members of the Committee will read, has highlighteseveral management issues on the most visible program at NASA, the International Space Station.	N
Existing deficiencies in management structure, institutional culture, cost estimating, anprogram control must be acknowledgeancorrectein order for the program to move forward.	N
Cost estimates for the U.S.-fundeenhancements are not sufficiently developeto assess credibility, anthere are opportunities to maximize research on the core station program with modest cost impact.	N
Baseon this Committee's work over the past years, I feel that many of these findings woulalso be applicable to many other programs at NASA.	N
I believe that we, the Congress, anthe Administration, neeto make a conscientious decision on the future of the Space Station.	N
I am willing to work with you another Members of the Committee anthe Administration to develop a plan within the next 120 days for the future of the Station.	N
The choice is whether we want to continue spending $100 billion of taxpayer funds anreceive 20 hours per week of research in return, or do we want to invest additional funds anget a more functional research facility in return.	N
Space science, earth science, space transportation anaeronautics are all important to NASA, as well as the Nation.	N
After the events of September 11th, the Nation is in neeof immediate advancements in the aeronautical science arena.	N
I know the Science, Technology, anSpace Subcommittee is considering additional hearings in this area, anI applauthem for doing so.	N
I look forwarto working with this outstanding nominee to define anrefine the agency's vision, however, we also know that vision without a strategy is just an illusion.	N
Again, I look forwarto working with the nominee to develop the appropriate strategy for this provision.	N
In light of the problems anconcerns I have just mentioneanmany others, I feel that Mr. O'Keefe makes an excellent nominee as an excellent Administrator of NASA.	D
I think he has the right skills ancapabilities at the right time to fully restore the meaning of NASA.	N
I think, as some have suggested, NASA faces some very unique challenges at this moment, anMr. O'Keefe's particular talent fits well with the opportunity to meet those challenges.	D
But let me say despite all of these issues that have been raised, anI think they are appropriately raised, I deeply admire the men anwomen of NASA who are America's finest explorers of our universe.	N
I have long believethat a society that stops exploring is a society that stops progressing.	N
This is an important anexciting set of missions on behalf of our country, anI believe all of us want success for NASA, so Mr. O'Keefe is offereto us by President Bush as his nominee.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anI thank you anChairman Hollings anSenator McCain for having this hearing early.	N
I have to say, I have reservations, not because of anything particular with you, but because I am concerneabout the OMB actions towarNASA, since the first of this year.	N
I think OMB has focuseon budget cutting anI don't think the leader of NASA can be just a budget cutter.	N
I think the leader of NASA must change the problems at NASA which are budget related, but they are leadership relateas well, anwe have been in limbo for too long, anI want to have a firm leader.	N
For that reason, I am going to ask for confirmation before we leave in December so that you can take firm control anhopefully prove that you have a vision for NASA that will be a long-term vision.	N
Most particularly, Mr. O'Keefe anI discussethe Young Report, anMr. O'Keefe suggestethat this woulbe the backbone of his beginning to grapple with the problems at NASA.	N
In the Young Report, I thought the most important reflag was the issue of the core complete 3-person crew that woulbe in the Space Station, anwhether that woulbe a permanent situation or whether the goal woulbe to achieve core complete 3-person crew anthen move beyonthat to the 7-person crew.	N
It is saiin the Young Report, anconfirmeby others that I consulted, that it takes about 2\1/2\ crew members just to operate the Space Station, thus leaving only half a person worth of man hours to conduct research.	N
If we expenall of the station efforts on operating the station, I think we will lose the forest among the trees.	N
We will lose the big picture anwe will lose what is uniquely NASA's mission, which is to go beyonoperating anhave the capability to do the innovative research that only the Space Station can do, such as with the microgravity conditions.	N
So I woullike to ask Mr. O'Keefe if he is committeto moving beyoncore complete into the capability to have more scientists be able to conduct the research.	N
In spirit with our international partners, we shoulseek to learn enough that is new ancreative in the medical field, as well as the scientific field, that we will all be able to then create the industries anthe improvements in quality of life that that research will bring.	N
I don't think you can precisely budget a war, anI don't think you can precisely budget innovative research.	N
You are going to have miscalculations, you are going to learn from those ancreate your final product.	N
So I am going to hope that there is more than a budget cutting mentality ana vision along with a common sense budget mentality.	N
I believe that he believes, along with Vice President Cheney, that NASA is one of the economic engines of America.	N
It is what has given us the leadership in the worlfor creative anvery valuable satellite information anquality of life improvements, anI think we can do more if you have the capability to produce the vision that will assure we stay in the forefront.	N
I think the Young Report is quite sound, anif you can create the infrastructure that will allow us to go forwarwith that vision, then NASA will get its feet back on the grounanwe will have the same kinof creativity anspirit at NASA that has inspirethe American people to be supportive anhas createa basis for new scientists anan inspiration to the young people of our country that science is a very important component of entrepreneurship ancreativity in our country.	N
I hope that we can give him the opportunity to be the leader at a very early chance, anI think before we leave, we shoulconfirm this nominee so that he can take the next 2 months when we are not in session to put his team together anbegin to offer us the plans that woulshow that there is a new day ana new vision ana new spirit for NASA.	N
Here's how we are going to proceeat this point, because we have a vote on the floor of the Senate.	N
We have the distinguisheMinority leader here with us, Senator Lott anhis schedule is very tight.	D
When we return, we will recognize Senator Nelson, who was here next, anthen Senator Allen anSenator Burns.	N
I just wanteto be here ancongratulate Sean O'Keefe on being nominatefor NASA Administrator.	N
I think NASA has an important role for our country, but I think NASA has been wandering arounfor the last several years without a real vision for the future without the type of leadership really needeanfrankly, in many instances, in certain programs without sufficient money to do the job properly.	N
Then in other areas, Congress has forcemoney on NASA for programs that probably are not of sufficient value.	N
So I hope that your experience at the Department of Management anBudget, anyour knowledge of Congress will help you in trying to get NASA headein the right direction.	D
I have felt like in recent years that commitments were made by NASA that weren't kept, anthat particularly unnerves me when I have the feel that the leadership of an agency is not being square with you or honest with you.	N
AnI hope that as certain people have saiwhy you neebudget responsibility anyour strengths, that you are not going there to just phase it out or phase it down.	N
If you are going to NASA just for a BRACC type arrangement, you are going to meet a lot of resistance from a lot of us here in this room.	N
I personally have been supportive of NASA over the years andisappointeat various times, but it is doing a lot of innovative things.	N
Vehicle manufacturing has a lot of potential that will be useful for NASA, but also in the commercial area.	N
One area that I am particularly interestein is the Landsat data continuity mission, which I think will yiela lot of that, anit will be useful in the private sector.	N
Once again, it looks to me like NASA is moving towarNASA owning a single satellite anminimizing the value of this program, as opposeto using the commercial, the private area to get the maximum bang for the buck anto make sure that there is competition anthat this is not just a government-run program.	N
For years, I have urgeNASA, by the way, to get the information you have, the technology you get, the science that you benefit from into the private sector, anthat has not been easy.	N
Are you committeto that type approach, as opposeto just a government-run anoperateprogram?	N
I am going to break for 10 minutes anas you can see, we are going to have a vigorous debate this morning anwe will start with Mr. Boehlert when we return.	N
Congressman Boehlert, it is getting to be a regular occasion that you are coming, as you were here yesterday anyour testimony was eloquent then.	N
Senator Nelson, I am in awe of your passion for this, but I also know from which it comes.	N
I have a higher opinion of the tenure of Dan Goldin, because he has done some things that alloweus to buila very positive support base in every community across this country.	D
We talk about the value of pushing the envelope, andoing those things that we can do now.	N
But we also, we tento forget about the work that was done to broaden the support of NASA, because no other single entity that this government does so stimulates the curiosity of young people, anedges them towarthe sciences anthe mathematics anthe physics that it is going to take to survive in this worlin the days ahead.	N
Take into account the financial constraints another limitations, I am very pleasewith Mr. Goldin, although the public was quick to criticize NASA for failemissions, it was the successes anthe advancements in the work with students that occurrewith little fanfare that the media dinot pick up.	N
But I woulsay to a Nation today that once we are lulleor numbeinto a society that shrinks andoes not push the envelope ancontinues to reach out anto explore the unknown, then we will be a shrinking society that will fade from the face of the earth.	N
150 NASA launches since 1952, anonly 10 on recorthat I have saithey were failemissions.	N
In my little State of Montana, 950,000 people, many of our State University researchers are working on NASA with several initiatives so far with very satisfactory results.	N
The University of Montana is a NASA partner on Earth observations systems or the OES program.	N
The university has promoteinterests in science, engineering antechnologies to all ages from the young to the elderly.	N
Montana State University anNASA officials recently participatein a conference on astrobiology.	N
How diwe get here anevolve anwhat is the destiny of life on Earth anwhat it means to us were some of the questions they asked.	N
The Institute of Thermal Biology hostea meeting with key researchers anNASA top management in an overview to finding the search for life in those environments.	N
Previously unknown life forms have been discoverein Yellowstone National Park under very, very difficult environments, analso in the golmines of South Africa desert that has never receivea drop of water.	N
So NASA's Earth sciences program is dedicateto transferring the knowledge that we know by looking down on Earth to the resources that can be utilizeto our Nation's agriculture anfooanfiber production, to our people who utilize our national renewable resources, our lanplanners, anour health organizations.	N
During the meeting I hawith Mr. O'Keefe, anI will say speaking as a Scottsman, turning this over to an Irishman makes me a bit uncomfortable there, but I was very encourageby his desire to reach out to students in educational institutions, anthat is the key to the NASA success.	N
They stuck it in a safe away from the rest of the worlanespecially to their own people.	N
Where NASA took the technology that we developeanset up technology transfer centers angot it out into the public sector where every one of us in this room, we drive automobiles, our new composites, our computer systems was a result of that technology transfer.	N
We continue to grow anto leathe worlwith not only this agency, but also all of America in various ways.	N
But it is like Senator Nelson said, this is a spirit of America, anwe are going to have failures, because we are dealing with pushing the envelope, anlike I said, nobody has to sell me on the merits of this program, because I am a disciple.	N
But I think that we have to have a vision to dream anwe have to make sure that this continues for my children angrandchildren angenerations to come that will prosper in this great country anthe spirit that it has.	N
But I really believe this is one of the most important appointments that this Administration will make anit is one of the most important missions that this Committee has under its jurisdiction in its support of the future.	N
I thank you for holding this hearing anI want to associate myself with the remarks that you made at the outset of this hearing, as well as those of Senator McCain, Senator Hutchison, anI dinot hear Senator Nelson, but Senator Burns hit the nail right on the head.	N
I look forwarto listening to your vision, your views as to where NASA needs to go anto the future analso working with you in the future.	N
In terms of leadership in the scientific community, NASA is just one of the very top in the entire world, not just this country, but all over the world.	N
In its scientific research that has direct benefits clearly to our national security annational defense, but also to our economy, antangibly over the years, has improvethe lives of Americans anpeople all over the world.	N
It is important to look at past recoranwhere it can be improved, but what I am most interestein is really what was alludeto by Senator Hutchison anSenator Burns, anthat is the core guiding principles that will mark your leadership.	N
No. 1, it shoulbe continuescientific excellence for the competitive leadership of America in aeronautics anspace, anthe seconprinciple shoulbe, of course, fiscal responsibility with the taxpayers' dollars.	N
Now, from what I have reain the newspapers andiscern through answers that you have had, Mr. O'Keefe, to the Committee questionnaires, I see that these objectives seem to be your objectives.	N
That is scientific excellence that we neeto focus on, because it is an important responsibility of NASA.	N
Back when I was Chairman of the subcommittee, before Senator Wyden was Chairman of the Science, Technology, anSpace Subcommittee, back in April, we hela hearing on aeronautics in our country.	N
At the same time, we hearabout a lack of attention given to the U.S. programs for advancements in this vital area of aeronautics.	N
The question is for all of us anyou as Administrator, Mr. O'Keefe, what does the UniteStates intento do about this?	N
If we are going to responto this challenge, which I think Americans woulwant us to do, when, anhow?	N
relatemanufacturing as far as jobs in this country is the next exporter in our economy anso if we lose this preeminence, that means a loss of some outstanding jobs ancapabilities here in our country.	N
A study by the National Research Council statethat the continuereductions in funding for aeronautics research andevelopment may have irreversible consequences.	N
Back in the 1970s an1980s, where our main competition may have been the Soviet Union, America was still alone at the top in the fielof aeronautics research.	N
But since early 1990s, the U.S. position in this fielhas steadily declineannow the very existence of our U.S. entry in this fielis being threateneby better fundeEuropean initiatives.	N
Once the UniteStates loses this leadership position, it will be extremely difficult to regain that leadership role given the difficulty of reassembling the infrastructure, the scientists, the engineers, the highly skillepeople in the investment capital that is needed.	N
I think in addition to this international challenge, we have a national challenge, Mr. O'Keefe, anthat has to do with better security.	N
I think advancements in aeronautics can help with security as well as better transportation system through the skies anthis is going to depenon new technologies, the neeis both short-term anlong-term.	N
We neeto pursue both evolutionary anrevolutionary advances, but the key to it is clearly human capital.	N
We neeto make sure that more anmore youngsters or younger people are studying in our colleges anuniversities.	N
The age of those who are in the aeronautics fielare older people, more likely to retire.	N
We have to reverse this trenby first increasing our efforts at aeronautics research at NASA, as well as the private sector.	N
I was very pleaseto reain one of the answers to your questionnaires that the use of colleges anuniversities in that effort anpartnership, it doesn't neeall to be NASA.	N
Our colleges anuniversities can help whatever the mission may be on that particular project, but also encourage youngsters or people who are being educateto get an education in aeronautics.	N
We must inspire to improve the lives of people in the future aninnovate, as well as make sure our economy is strong anmake sure we have security in our skies.	N
I anothers have saiwe are not looking for sounfinancial management as an enin itself.	N
It is really the underpinning for NASA to use the existing Federal funds to get back to its original goals: research anscientific exploration of space.	N
So we woulvery much like to see you lay out your scientific vision for NASA, anparticularly with regarto the agency's science anexploration goals.	N
Your predecessor, Mr. Goldin, was at NASA for nearly 10 years anlethe call for what was known as the faster, better, cheaper approach at NASA.	N
Mr. O'Keefe, I woulvery much like the final answer that you were giving to the Chairman here.	N
The efforts of NASA, in particular in aeronautics, has always been for NASA to be involvein some of these high-risk research ventures.	N
Some of those that the private sector coulnever do, but in collaboration with the government, it is very important.	N
Anlet me first ask you, do you consider aeronautics research still a core function of NASA?	N
Do you believe that investment in aeronautics in the future, you are talking about entrepreneurial spirit, do you think that investments in that research will produce positive results for our country anaeronautics generally?	N
Now, during this perioof declining funding for NASA, anI have mentionethis in my opening statement, our European competitors, as well as the Japanese, have been increasing their aeronautics research andevelopment funding, anthe European Commissions announcea new plan to significantly further increase their government funding for aeronautical research.	N
They have estimatefunding, public anprivate that coulexcee$100 billion U.S. dollars over the next 2 decades.	N
In spite of this, there have been proposesignificant reductions in NASA's aeronautical research budget in fiscal year 2002.	N
Now, I know this is argumentative question, but I want to hear what your principles are, but do you believe that it is in our best interests as a Nation to allow our aeronautical anaviation capabilities to wither in the face of this competition, or if you say that we can have a huge positive impact in the future, how do we turn that arounanface that competition?	N
The NASA aeronautical research centers work closely with FAA anpolicies affecting flight safety or the airline system capacity which everyone on this Committee knows has to be done anit is a wonderment that everyone knows it needs to be done.	N
Do you see NASA expanding in these particular collaborative partnerships with other government agencies.	N
What I woullike to do today is to expanthat discussion, anthere will be some repetition, because I woullike to get it as part of the record, but I woullike to give you an opportunity for expanding anexpounding your ideas.	N
I too think that one of the great public servants, particularly in the aerospace field, has been Tom Young.	N
There are troubling parts to me of Young, one of which we discusseyesterday, that because of NASA's financial situation that you woulpossibly lower the number of annual launches of the Space Shuttle to four.	N
That has some enormous consequences, because if we suddenly then hato robustly increase ana lot of all of this expertise habeen laioff in the process, then in having to rehire, you lose a lot of that corporate memory that has been so valuable to NASA, why do not you comment on that?	N
This is just a beginning, so whenever you want me to stop anpass it on, I am just going to continue as you will permit.	N
Let me, before we senit on to Senator Burns, say that the Young Commission report in anof itself is a goodocument.	N
But when you put it into the context that NASA has been a baboy, anthat NASA must be punished, anso that we are going to fina way to redirect funds within NASA, that is when I start to get concerned.	N
Now, no less a space giant than Chris Kraft has written a letter, an open letter concerning the recent report of the task force chaireby Tom Young.	N
He says: ``First it is difficult to perceive that such a formidable group''--talking about the Young Commission--``woulpresent such a narrow view.	N
You woulthink that many members of the task force knew the past history of NASA Space Station activity angiven that premise hato realize that today's financial status was almost preordained.	N
``The overruns--or more poignantly, the total cost of the ISS--resultefrom a continuous change in direction of the program which was beyonthe control of those who were requireto builthe Space Station.''	N
He continues, ``if you take into account the sordihistory of the Space Station, you will finthat the people in NASA who were saddlewith making a program work which was almost unmanageable in the first place, have done a miraculous job to bring the program to the point it is at today for the money that they hato do it with.	N
``As usual, the working level people get blamefor the horrible mess createby the people who dinot have to do the job.''	N
Anhe concludes, ``the Space Station has been through at least five different phases since its inception.	N
To then take that sordihistory of which has producesome remarkable technology that has been a symbol with remarkable adaptability to make it work, anit is.	N
I want us to get that corrected, but I do not want to use that as an excuse to punish NASA, to penalize the people, to knock the Space Shuttle program down to almost nothing, anthen not have a talentecapable workforce that when we neeto surge in the future, anthereby a time to surge in the future, then all of that base is gone.	N
Mr. O'Keefe, there are two areas of which I am specifically interested, probably three areas.	N
It has been a launchpafor many smaller universities ancolleges in their research anR&D work that has allowethem to participate in the national agenda of NASA, ansome goothings have come from that by the way that they weren't all founat MITs anthis type thing.	N
I think it is one of those ongoing things that we have to strive for a little imagination for the entrepreneurial community anhow they can participate in this anderive benefits from it that benefit us all, anthen I think when we look at the infrastructure anour mission aheaaninto the vision of things andealing with dollars to complete those missions, I think we shouldn't shortchange the work that has been done anthe work yet to do on unmannereusables.	N
We are talking about the Shuttle anthe orbiter that we have now that is getting along in years, no doubt about it.	N
Going to have to be some thought for the future there, but some of these trips coulbe made by unmannereusables at a cost savings.	N
AnI think we shoulcontinue to explore the challenges that we have in developing a single launch, a vehicle, in other words.	N
It is just a vehicle that can get into orbit andeliver the goods anthen come back to earth without a pilot, to move some of the material that we are going to have to move in space.	N
If there is one thing that we have in this government right now that we have 2 or 3 agencies that are doing the same thing.	N
Redundancy does not serve us well, anwhen we start talking about a limiteamount of funds that we have to use.	N
Some of the work that is being done at NASA is also being done in the FAA, another areas, anI think it is time to take a look on how we can bring those programs together anmaybe streamline that annot have the redundancy that seems like it occurs.	N
I am always struck by the work that goes on at NIH, anI am also struck by the amount of money that we spenin the Veterans Administration to do some of the things that NIH does, anI do not know why everybody has to have their own turf or whatever in R&D.	N
Not to diminish the job that the previous director did, because I think he has done a lot of things in unseen places that was of little notice, but hahigh impact as far as the support of what we do in space.	N
We know that it is going to be a long time before everything that we do anall the benefits is realizeby the society that pays the bills, but nonetheless, I think right now, NASA doesn't owe this society a lot right now.	N
I think we have profitein many, many ways that are untolanthey are not the sexy above-the-foltype issues.	N
So those are the areas that I continue to be very much interestein, anI think the reusables is just one of those areas where we have to take a very serious look at that anhow we maneuver anhow we will move materiel in space to complete the infrastructure for the mission that is ahead.	N
I will support you wholeheartedly anI am sure we will have discussions anconversations in the future, ana very pleasant holiday to you anyour family.	N
There have been three inventions that have completely changeour lives, anit changethe way we think anthe way we do business.	N
Anthose three inventions were the silicon chip, before that, think what the invention of the transistor has done.	N
It has been absolutely revolutionary as far as electronics are concerned, anof course, the jet engine.	N
I got a big kick of sitting next to a guy on an airplane anwe were 5 minutes late getting into Minneapolis anthe only thing he couldo is complain about being late anhere we are whipping through the air at 550 miles an hour anhe is worrieabout 5 minutes.	N
I apologize for having to leave, but I wanteto return, because I wanteto ask you to address the issue of the 3-member crew as a long-	N
term permanent goal, or is your long-term permanent goal to increase the number in the crew so that we can do the research anhow you plan to make the changes that woulallow that to happen if it is your goal.	N
I am remindeof an olseries calle``Yes, Minister,'' that was on BBC, anone of the series was about a wonderful new hospital anthe Prime Minister visitethe hospital anhe was shown arounanthis new hospital haall of the state-of-the-art equipment anit was a fabulous hospital.	N
Now, when I am talking to you about NASA, anall the money in the Shuttle program an3-member crew at the station, 2\1/2\ of whom are necessary to do the running of the station, I am left with the feeling that we are going to have an operation that is there to service the operation.	N
Anthat we coullose sight of the purpose of all of this, which is science anthe research.	N
So tell me that you are committeto making sure that we do not get into a situation where patients are just an extraneous luxury.	N
If I couljust say, I think you have gotten the message from everyone that I have hearspeak this morning that we are looking to you to be the person who has the capability to implement a program that assures that the science antechnology anexperimentation is preserveanenhancefor NASA.	N
I know all of us are going to be vitally interestein this, because we believe that NASA is a premiere success story for America, anit is the place where our new scientists have a capability to create.	N
We are going to have a number of additional rounds, because of the interest of my colleagues.	N
The Senator from Florida askeif he coulask a question then we will go back to the regular order.	N
As a follow-up to the Senator from Texas, anagain my hat is off to you for offering yourself to public service in this capacity, because it is a very tough assignment.	D
Anthe fact that you have a personal relationship with the Vice President is considerably to your advantage, as well as to the advantage of NASA.	D
But I want to follow up Senator Hutchison's question, because the answer that you gave dinot sounlike the answer that you gave on November 7th to the House Science Committee, in which you saithat you dinot favor a 10 to 15 percent increase in ISS funding to enable a 7 person crew until the cost considereas reacredibility is regained.	N
Yet you agree that you want an increaselevel of scientific productivity that coulbe accomplishelater in the decade.	D
I do not see how if you keep a 3 person crew today, anthat will stay with us at least through 2006, how that is not going to severely limit--as Senator Hutchison has suggested, for the immediate future--that is another 4 years, the scientific activity on the station.	N
Then once you regain the cost credibility that you are looking for, then it is going to take another 4-5 years to develop a 7-person crew return vehicle, anso the concern that I have as a follow-up is doesn't that push us off until about 2010 in order to get any significant science up there on the Space Station?	N
I think we want to have multiple rounds of questions anhave a chance to pursue this with each Senator getting 5 minutes.	N
If you want to ask one additional question at this point, then we will go back to the regular order.	N
I will do it however you want, but I do not want to break a train of thought, Mr. Chairman.	N
So my question was what do you think about the 3-man crew anhow can you do the science anwhen do you want to change that 3-man crew?	N
For this rounI am going to ask one question about the Space Station, core complete design eliminates habitation model ancrew rescue vehicle making our astronauts dependent on Russian partners for critical needs.	N
How can NASA effectively manage its work on the Space Station given dependence on international partners?	N
When you are confirmed, anI am going to assure there is a rapiconfirmation, when will you go to NASA anassume your administrative duties?	N
There is a great deal of speculation that when you are confirmed, you go through another budget round, people concerneabout cuts will say ``he is going to slash us then go on down.''	N
These ones that I specifically mentioneare far aheaof where they are at this moment anwe are going to have to finways for them to upgrade.	N
Obviously some of those decisions by the commercial sector will be determineby their own bottom lines anwhat they can do to upgrade their own systems anhow it makes a difference in their bottom line as far as more passengers or greater safety for their planes.	N
I just wanteto conclude, Mr. O'Keefe by saying I have enjoyelistening to you anhearing your ideas.	N
I think the best thing that I have learnefrom this hearing which you cannot reafrom answering questionnaires or reading articles, is that you have a sense of humor.	N
I always think it is important for people to have common sense anthat they keep their promises, but it is also important in addition to having thick skin ana sense of humor.	N
All that does is create uncertainty amongst this dedicategroup we have across the country.	N
The Chairman pointeout that that is our lifeboat anwe are relying on the Russian Soyuz today.	N
NASA has haplans for its own rescue vehicle which woulrequire us going beyoncore complete, anI want to ask you how important a priority it is for you to determine how safe it is and, to rely on the Russian Soyuz anto determine if we neeto move forwaron our own crew rescue vehicle as a top priority?	N
But it will be a priority for you to get right to it, because if you determinethat it needs to be a priority moveup, then you can put that in your budget submissions and, because it is important to me to know that you have lookeat that anmade the determination here to go forwarwith our own crew rescue vehicle or that Soyuz is safe for the time being.	N
I just wanteto follow up again on the Chairman's point anthen I will let Senator Nelson go forward, because I appreciate his deference.	N
I wanteto clarify your answer to the Chairman on when you woultake control of NASA once the Senate has confirmeyou.	N
Diyou say that it woulbe no longer than 1 month after confirmation that you woulexpect to be at the helm of NASA?	N
If the Senate actebefore we leave next week anyou have a well-deservefamily vacation, then woulit be your intention to immediately go to NASA antake control?	N
I want to follow up Senator Hutchison's questions about the lifeboat of the Soyuz, anthere is some talk that in doing the delays on an American lifeboat that you might employ the Soyuz.	N
What about this report in the Orlando Sentinel that they are threatening to pull out, because of the propensity to scale back the lab.	N
They are obviously being put in a very difficult situation, so what is your thinking at this point about how we go about assuring our international partners that they will have the full utilization anat the same time to handle all in your management of cost?	N
This report is the latest reflection of considerable agitation among our international partners, of which there has been circulatein the NASA community a letter from the Canadian government, which is at least a month old, stating that the UniteStates has breacheits agreement.	N
How do you, other than conferring with Secretary Powell anSecretary Armitage, how do you go about solving a problem if you have not got room for them to get up there on the station unless, in fact, you move to develop the technology to allow to you have more than 3 on a station?	N
Since our role constitutionally is to advise before we consent, may I respectfully advise you that the two gentlemen that you mention happen to be two of the finest appointments in the Administration.	N
I have hathe capacity as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to get to know them.	N
Of whether or not you are going to move to a position of whether you can have more than 3 anset a goal of when it is going to be anthen work it out with your international partners.	N
Anthat is why I askeyou the question about whether or not as an interim solution do you buy a seconSoyuz antry to fix it some way up there where it is dockeif you cannot spenthe money to do the 7-man lifeboat.	N
One that I think we just neeto be a bit clearer on is the research agenda anhow it is going to be determined.	N
What are the processes, the structure that you are going to follow for making decisions about the research agenda, for example, who are you going to seek input from with respect to research.	N
We have toucheon it throughout the morning, but I woullike to come back to that anhave you set out clearly how you are going to pursue this.	N
How woulyou go about striking the balance between human space flight anthe other responsibilities at NASA?	N
I am not completely clear, either where you believe human biological science fits as part of the Space Station project either.	N
As you can see, he anI have a number of areas we want to explore, anI pledgethat we wouldn't bring in the corn flakes for breakfast.	N
One additional that is been important to me is understanding how the Bush Administration is going to approach overall space policy from the military, civil ancommercial side of this discussion.	N
The Administration has statehow important it views a space-basenational missile defense, for example.	N
President Eisenhower's desire to separate military ancivilian space activities leto the creation of the agency, but the Defense Department retaining control over military space programs.	N
Tell us, if you would, what is the Administration's overall space policy for military, civil, ancommercial space anwho in the Administration is going to go about coordinating these various areas?	N
Do you foresee the Administration, Mr. O'Keefe, formally issuing a new space policy, anif the answer is yes, I woulbe interested, for example, on how that wouldiffer from the Clinton Administration?	N
Earlier, you saithat you woulconsider as a result of the Young Report, the reduction of 4 flights a year.	N
This is a considerable concern, because it was at this very table that in September we haa hearing on Space Shuttle safety anunanimously all of the participants in the hearing, which includeboth inside anoutside NASA, saiif you are going to fly the Space Shuttle, we are going to fly it safely anthat was the No. 1 priority.	N
What I'like to know is before you woulmake such a decision, will you come anreport specifically to Congress anseek our advice?	N
Anin making such a decision, will external independent groups or NASA conduct an analysis on the impact?	N
I just want to express as part of our constitutional role of advising, if you look at this decision anthe Young Report through the prism of a mindset of OMB, there is going to be considerable risk to the space program, because such a decision, for example, on reducing to four flights per year means that there woulbe a considerable layoff of the workforce, particularly at the Cape, at the Kennedy Space Center, the finest launch team in the world.	N
Ansuch a financial decision to reduce the launches to 4 woulmean a considerable layoff of that expertise anthen when the time comes anit surely will, that we start to ramp up, you lose a lot of that ability, anyou have seen that kinof hurky-jerky kinof approach in the past has not serveus well.	N
So as Senator Hutchison says, if you start moving in that direction, not only will she be all over you, but I will too.	N
Because the bottom line is going to affect safety, anthat is one of the most dangerous points of the whole Shuttle mission--	N
Anif you will do Shuttle upgrades, they can move it up to 1-in-1,000, significantly increasing the safety factor, but you cannot do that if you start reducing your flight rate to 4.	N
One of the things that I think you ought to consider also in view of the war on terrorists is that you have to have this vehicle as reliable assureaccess to space to back up your expendables.	N
Anyou coulgo on through a number of the other expendables antheir launch pads that have to be operable, anso if you are looking at assureaccess to space, there cannot be any mistakes with regarto the Space Shuttle.	N
We have begun to look at balancing the neefor safety upgrades versus the various other needs.	N
I think it woulbe helpful to know what role you see Shuttle playing for future space transportation needs.	N
Let me turn now to the question of privatization, anparticularly, privatizing the Shuttle.	N
You, as I understanit, are on recoras supporting the further privatization of the Shuttle another programs.	N
If the Shuttle is turneover to the private sector, how do you go about ensuring that NASA gets the things it needs at those prices?	N
It is our Subcommittee's understanding that China is going to sena mannecraft in space before 2005, anpreparation for a mission to the Moon is underway.	N
Well, so that as you woulbe trying to conclude that, let me put your initial consideration of this question of privatization in the context of what has happenein history.	N
Anwhen Challenger exploded, we realizethat the mistake was that we were trying to make it be too many things to too many people.	N
Anthus the policy decision, anthis was during the time of the Reagan Administration, was that the commercial payloads coulbest be launcheon expendable booster rockets, anthat you woulsave the Space Shuttle primarily where you dithe human in the loop, thus the scientific experiments, space telescope, antherefore, on the manifest, any of those commercial payloads, they finishethose, but they dinot redo them.	N
What I am afraiof is that there is this preference for privatization that does not apply to a scientific vehicle, anso I raise again the question that you will have to consider in the future, which you say you cannot address now, does privatization mean a return to commercial vehicles?	N
Anif you move to the so-calleprivatization, well, what about all the grouninfrastructure?	N
There is a substantial amount of expense of all of that stuff that goes along the space program, some of which by the way we have been trying to address ansome of these appropriations bills, you know, the VAB has panels peeling off of it, Lorhelp us if a hurricane comes through there.	N
We have gotten a lot of that corrosion that is going on down there in the Cape from years of salt spray anso forth.	N
How is a private company that is going to be incentivizeto redo all of that under a contract that they have to operate under specific cost, so I want you to arch your eyebrow as you approach what the President has given you as marching orders when you are dealing with a research vehicle ana research program like this, you may not have gotten this through your lens at OMB.	N
I suspect that you woulhave gotten some of this from your experience as controller of DoD, anas Secretary of the Navy.	N
A recent press report, Mr. O'Keefe said, anI will just quote here: ``NASA also hopes to lantwo unmannespacecraft on Mars, launch a number of Earth observing satellites ana new space telescope in the next couple of years.''	N
I am struck that as we look at the scientific possibilities, the excitement always come back to showing that you can liberate funds from areas that are either low priority or administratively inefficient, anthat debate certainly starts with the Space Station, but there are a lot of other parts to it.	N
Perhaps what symbolizes it for me is when you came as Deputy Director of OMB, you tolthe House Appropriations Committee that there woulbe a cost overrun of $4 billion on the Space Station anthen a few days after the hearing, NASA came back ansaithe figure was more than $800 million or more than that, anI assume actually woullike to have you comment on, I assume that one of your top priorities is going to try to restore the credibility of NASA with respect to estimating these future cost questions.	N
Well, anclearly to make the case of additional funds, you are going to have to show that you are making better use of current dollars, given they are citing one inefficiency after another.	N
I think you have the potential to really be a man for the times anto show that by cutting some of the massive overheaanthe inefficiency that you can help the agency reach the stars.	N
It is not close to what you are going to have as you try to make what I call the transition back to the agency's original mission.	N
I think that is what this is all about is to take out the original charter for a science anresearch-driven kinof mission anthen as you have describeit, go out to the Senators anscientists anvarious communities that are directly affecteby this, anthen bring to Congress an agenda that we can rally anpromoting a kinof development to breakthrough technologies anhistorical scientific developments that are so important.	N
Before I turn this over to Senator Nelson, let me also recognize that we have haa terrific fellow come over from the NIST agency, Kevin Kimball.	D
He has just done a terrific job for the Subcommittee, particularly on getting us ready for today's hearing.	N
I think the Senator knows, I am going to work very closely with them anwe are going to get on these issues anput the kinof focus on it that allows us to promote the kinof science that the Senator from Florida is advocating.	N
Not only woulit have the affects of what I was talking about in all of the layoffs, but it woulalso have the affect of very likely moth-balling at least 1 of the 4 orbiters, anthat is going backwards.	N
The Shuttle upgrades funding has been minimized, anunder the present plan will no longer be fundeafter 2005 baseon NASA's current plan to shelve the orbiter fleet by 2012, because in NASA's budget plan we have about $5 billion for this thing callespace launch initiative, which is really a development now of technology, so tell us what you believe about this space launch initiative as it's currently planneanfunded.	N
I fully appreciate the fact that you cannot come to the table knowledgeable about all of this.	N
But they still have $5 billion in the budget over the next several years to develop a technology and, because of that, they are still postponing a lot of the upgrades that will directly affect the safety of the Space Shuttle, so if we are not going to have a replacement vehicle by 2012, which we are not, we got to keep the present horse in goocondition to get us where we neeto get.	N
So as I suggesteto you last night, one of the things that you may look at since this space launch initiative is more towarthe development of technology, see if you can get the Department of Defense as a partner in sharing the cost of that, because it wouldirectly affect the Department of Defense giving you a little more breathing room in the NASA budget to go on ankeep doing the Space Shuttle safety upgrades, because we just cannot afforto lose that vehicle as a reliable assureaccess to space.	N
Anthen I woulask for you to consider, because this is much more technical stuff of RDT&E, research development testing anevaluation in NASA's hardware procurements.	N
Do you have any particular DoD experience, by the way, that might be applicable to your ideas about procurement reform at NASA?	N
Before we conclude the hearing, I'like to give you an opportunity to lay out for the recorwhat is your vision?	N
I am grateful that you are exciteabout it, anI woulonly conclude the hearing by saying that as part of that vision, that this one Senator's vision is that we are a Nation of explorers anadventurers, anwe always haa frontier.	N
Anif we ever abandon trying to challenge that frontier, we will become a second-rate Nation.	N
But we won't, because of little agencies like NASA that keep that vision alive to fulfill the character of the American people as adventurers anexplorers.	N
We are in the Full Committee, this afternoon on the confirmation of two nominees submitteby the administration, Mr. Jeffrey Shane to be Associate Deputy Secretary, Mr. Emil Frankel to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation Policy at the Department of Transportation.	N
We are delighteto have some of our colleagues here to introduce our nominees anwe will get right to their remarks anlet them be excuseafter they make their comments.	N
Of course, our goofrienSenator Dois here, anChris, we welcome your introductory comments.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anI suspect you will be seeing shortly come through the door my colleague as well, Senator Lieberman, who wants to be here as well on behalf of Emil, to express our support for this nominee.	N
You will see, Mr. Chairman, as you go antake a look at the backgrounqualifications of Emil Frankel, that this is just a first-class nomination, anI want to commenthe administration for reaching out to Emil to fill this position.	D
He serveas our Commissioner of Transportation in Connecticut for about 4 or 5 years, back in the early 1990s, I might point out during those immediately after the passage of ISTEA, which, as we all know, arounthe country a transition perioanvery, very difficult, the first major federal legislation designeto encourage intermodal planning anmultimodal operations, anhe just dia fabulous job in our state as the Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Transportation.	D
Since then, he has been an adjunct professor at the University of Connecticut, a fellow at HarvaranYale, a graduate of Wesleyan University, Harvarlaw degree, knows these issues, knows economic development issues.	D
You tie these together, you have really got in the person of this nominee a remarkable individual who will bring, I think, some wonderful observations, analysis to the office of Transportation Policy.	D
He served, as I said, as a very successful Commissioner in our state, anI think across the boarin our delegation in Connecticut you will hear nothing but kudos about Emil Frankel.	D
Well, it is gooto have you here, Senator Dodd, anit is gooto have Mr. Frankel anyour delegation supporting you.	N
You have two Democratic Senators who are strongly in support of you, anthat is a goosign.	D
Next, if it is OK, because I think Joe haanother engagement--Joe, do you want to go aheaanmake comments now?	N
Junior colleagues always fina word, but we always start with an expression of respect for our senior colleague.	N
Very briefly, I am delighteto come before you today, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Emil Frankel.	N
He has serveas a very able anhighly respecteCommissioner of Transportation for Connecticut for 4 years.	D
During those 4 years in Connecticut he oversaw 4,000 employees ana $1 billion annual budget, was responsible for construction, rehabilitation anmanagement of a genuinely multimodal transportation system, anat the same time he was chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment of the American Association of State Highway anTransportation Officials.	N
Since he has left the state, he has been involveas an advisor to the Massachusetts Transportation Authority.	D
I have searchehis record, anwanting to create credibility before you, Mr. Chairman, having two Democrat Senators support him, I have lookefor some Republican contact, because he serveunder a truly independent governor of the State of Connecticut but serveas legislative assistant to Senator Javits.	D
Anyway, this is a very gooanable person, anI am really thrillethat the President has put him before you for this Assistant Secretary of Transportation.	D
I noticed--I think I noticed--yes, I noticethat in the conflicts of interest in Mr. Frankel's testimony that Mr. Frankel has agreeto, if he is confirmed, to sell his stock in Enron Corporation.	N
We are going to move on anhave Congressman Jim Oberstar--Jim, if you woulcome on up with Mr. Jeffrey Shane, anMr. Frankel, go aheaanstay at the desk, anwe will have both of our nominees at the table, anwe will look forwarto having Congressman Jim Oberstar's introductory comments for Mr. Jeffrey Shane.	N
I think you are certainly correct that Chairman Fritz Hollings deserves the lion's share of the credit.	D
year history of the Department of Transportation has a person been nominatefor a position at DOT with better or more appropriate credentials than Jeff Shane, the only exception perhaps being the current Secretary, Norm Mineta.	D
I was present at the creation of the Department of Transportation in 1966 as administrative assistant to my predecessor, John Blotnick, who chairethe appropriate subcommittee at the request of President Johnson, managethe legislation that craftethe Department, anso I have haa long view of this issue, anthose who have fillevarious positions.	D
Jeff Shane comes to this position with a sweep of intellect, with the personal anprofessional integrity, with more than three decades of extensive experience with the Department of State anDepartment of Transportation on international aviation antrade policy, with credentials that will enable him to take commanof the duties of the office on which he is about to enter without breaking stride, with a clarity of purpose, with a clear understanding.	D
My experience with Jeff Shane extends back over a decade ana half to his service at both the State Department anDOT in the Reagan anGeorge H. Bush administrations.	N
In my capacity as Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I founJeff Shane always to be a model of intellectual probity, thoroughly knowledgeable on a wide range of issues on which he was calleto act, informed, anconsistently ana constantly vigilant, vigorous advocate for U.S. aviation interests, ana skillful, effective international negotiator.	D
He was the architect of our government's open skies policy, Mr. Chairman, to promote competition in our bilateral aviation agreements.	D
Under this policy, we achievevery significant competitive agreements that advancethe cause of U.S. aviation, turneour share in the most important international aviation markets from 40-60 American-foreign, or 30-70 to 70-30 an60-40 in favor of the UniteStates.	N
In the aftermath of the enactment of ISTEA, we were having a discussion about the significance of this legislation anhe said, it is one of the most extraordinary, innovative transportation measures ever enacted.	N
It has hathe exceptional benefit of causing Assistant Secretaries at the policy level in the Department to get together to share our thoughts, understaneach other's mode of transportation better, to begin thinking anacting intermodally, something we have long needeto do.	N
Secretary Mineta has tolme several times that he wants Jeff to upgrade the Department's Policy Office to create, as he put it, a worlclass think tank.	D
Well, I support those efforts, anin fact 2 years ago while Jeff was in the private sector he anCharlie Honicutt, who came to me anout of concern about the level of staffing at DOT--Honicutt also helthe same position in the Clinton administration--to explore means of upgrading the aviation policy staff.	N
Normally, folks out in the private sector, they have left government, they forget about the public policy issues, but Jeff was concerned.	D
We met weekly to fashion ideas, approaches, strategies to get the funding necessary to buildup the staff, which in the demise of the CAB, when it was transferreover to DOT, was one time 300, is now well under 100, anhalf of those are at retirement age, anyou do not have the critical expertise in the Department to analyze these multibillion dollar aviation trade deals that we are in the process of negotiating.	N
Jeff Shane is concerneabout it, anwanteus to do the right thing, took an enormous amount of time to address this issue, annow he will have the opportunity to first-handeal with it, with the support of the Secretary.	D
I can think of no one better qualifieto attract new staff, to keep them anto inspire them., anin these post September 11 times, in the aftermath of enactment of this landmark aviation antransportation security law, DOT needs at the policy level a person with Jeff Shane's experience, intellectual capacity, honesty, openness to new ideas, anthe energy to pursue animplement innovation.	D
His reentry into public service, Mr. Chairman, will produce better transportation policy decisions to the benefit of our nation's economy anto the benefit of the Department, anto the benefit of the American public generally.	D
You are truly the transportation guru of the House, anthose remarks coming from you are very encouraging about your relationship with Mr. Shane anyour knowledge of his background, anyour support is very important.	D
It is clear that both of these nominees have bipartisan support from both Republicans anDemocrats, anthat has got to be a very positive indication about the job they are going to be able to do.	D
So Congressman, thank you for being with us, anyou can go back ando something over there.	N
Mr. Shane, we will allow you to go first, if you woulgive your statement, anthen we will follow with Mr. Frankel.	N
Thank you both very much, gentlemen, for being with us, anthanks for your commitment to come back.	D
I think goopeople for the right job is absolutely critical, anthat means getting people with experience both in the private sector anin the public sector to serve.	D
The fact that they were doing it in the private sector anare willing to come back at great sacrifice as far as I am concerneis something that is very positive, annot negative at all.	N
I want to also express the fact that I am the only Senator here shoulnot be considereas a basign for either of you.	N
Because of the fact that if you all were controversial, or were less than supporteby this Committee, every Senator woulbe here trying to tear you apart.	N
The fact that I am doing this on behalf of the Chairman, by myself, indicates actually the strong support that you have from both sides of the Committee, so it shoulnot be in any way seen as a slight, really as positive.	N
Anthat focus on policy development is across all different venues of transportation annot just aviation, but the big picture.	N
Let me hope that when you leave this position you will be able to look back ansay, it was a better place than when I got there.	N
Let me talk a little bit about the concept, since it is a policy decision that you are in.	N
It has become increasingly, anperhaps now because of the economics of the situation we are in, more anmore concernethat in order to have competition anfree markets, you have to have competitors, that you cannot have competition without competitors, anmore anmore it seems to me that more anmore we have less anless.	N
More anmore we have fewer railroads, more anmore we have fewer oil companies, more anmore we have fewer airlines, more anmore we have fewer anfewer telephone companies, anit is sort of something that is permeating throughout society.	N
There is a great deal of activity anconsolidation anmergers anwhat-have-you, anif we enup with two railroads in this country, or two airlines in this country, how are we going to have real competition, anif you do not have competition, the alternative is, government regulates.	N
If we only have one railroad, we are going to regulate where they go, what they charge, anwho they serve.	N
The same thing with, you name the industry, anso competition is an essential ingredient, anyou must have competitors in order to have competition.	N
Can you just give me some of your philosophy about the things that are happening out there, anwhat your recommendations might be?	N
We have been in this area of trying to make sure that people who drive trucks that carry hazardous materials are qualifiein order to do that, anCongress has been involvein the Patriot Act anrequiring backgrounchecks to be performeon all commercial drivers, anthere is a debate about who is going to do that, whether the industry is going to do it, or whether the government is going to do it, or whether we are going to have a combination of some form to be able to do it.	N
I suggested, maybe naively, but it seems like it made a lot of sense, that we now require backgrounchecks for the purchase of firearms in this country, anwe get those backgrounchecks done in 24 hours so somebody can buy or not buy a hangun, which I imagine is done through some type of a computer system.	N
I am just wondering, why can we not use that same type of computer information on people who have criminal records, anextract that information for the purpose of determining whether they shoulhave a commercial license to be able to transport hazardous material.	N
Can you give me your thinking, anwhat your recommendations woulbe on how we are going to resolve the question on how we can as quickly anfairly as we can get criminal backgrounchecks on people that are applying for these licenses?	N
Well, I take it on that point that the administration is now of the opinion that that act is not necessary.	N
We hasome technical corrections which I think they are saying it is not really necessary now, that I think some of us felt that it woulbe helpful to have it spelleout in legislation, anyou neeto take a look to see.	N
We are not trying to pass legislation just to pass it, but I think if it is needed, anit is necessary, we want you all to take a look at it.	N
Can either of you give some indication of what we can do as an administration anas a Congress concerning the financial status of Amtrak?	N
We have got the legislation requiring that they liquidate if they do not operate in the black.	N
I mean, what do we neeto do to assure the traveling public who uses rail transportation as a means of moving arounthe country that we are going to invest in this system?	N
I mean, if you look at what--anwe always hear the stories about what Japan anwhat Europe has done to emphasize rail as a transportation of people.	N
The systems are generally much better supported, anthere is a lot reasons, because of geography anthe size of the countries, of course, but I hesitate to think what woulhappen to the Northeast Corridor with aviation if we dinot have Amtrak.	N
I support it, but what can you tell the Congress, anperhaps in general right now, that we neeto be doing to reassure this country that we are going to have an Amtrak system that is going to be available?	N
Mr. Shane, as a policy forecaster, perhaps, in the Department can you share some thoughts on that?	N
I guess I have the conclusion that we ought to quit trying to make Amtrak operate at a profit.	N
Make them operate efficiently, but recognize that a transportation system in crowdecorridors using the rail is in the national interest, anwe are going to have to quit worrying about whether it can only exist if it makes a profit.	N
I think it is in the national interest to have that there, because it also helps other sectors, other transportation sectors immensely.	N
Do we have to recognize we are going to have to spensome money on it, or do we take the position that if they cannot make it, we will shut them down?	N
If your trains are running full, we will operate at a profit, anif you cannot operate at a profit, we do not neeyou, or you shoulnot be there.	N
I am not trying to pin you down, but maybe if you coulelaborate, I mean, just from a philosophy type of standpoint, do you think that Amtrak shoulonly exist if it coulmake its way financially, or woulyou be put into the category that, let us say it is in the national interest, anyou are going to have a financial commitment of some sort to assist it to provide the service?	N
I shoulknow, but I do not think I do, but I woulimagine that other countries that have successful rail transportation systems, they are probably not money- making operations, whether it is in Europe or in Asia or Japan.	N
I woulimagine that those countries have a financial commitment to keep those passenger transportation systems in place of some sort.	N
If you make the decision that a rail transportation system is in the national interest anit cannot make a go of it financially so we are going to have to assist it ansubsidize it, coulyou not say the same thing for the aviation industry?	N
I mean, there is not an airline out there right now, but maybe one, that is probably showing a profit, so eventually, when you do not show a profit, you cease to exist in a free market.	N
Therefore, an aviation system is in our national interest, so we are going to subsidize passengers on all of the airlines to make sure they do not go away, anthen you can extrapolate that to everything that you think is in the national interest anmove away from a free market society.	N
Well, I think if we do have some additional questions to both of you gentlemen, I think we will submit them anask that you respond.	N
After that is completed, I woulhope the Chairman woultry to process this out of the Committee as quickly as possible anhope we can get it done perhaps before we leave, because the question is, nobody knows when we are going to leave.	N
I think you are uniquely qualified, anthank you for agreeing to serve, anwith that, the hearing will be adjourned.	D
The Senate Commerce Committee is meeting today for a confirmation hearing to examine the qualifications of Mr. HarolStratton, who has been nominateby the President to serve as Commissioner anChairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	N
I have a very brief statement, but I think perhaps even before I give the statement, I will call on my colleague, Senator Domenici, from the state of New Mexico, who is here to introduce the nominee.	N
Maybe it's just the weight of my body, but these seats that you sit us in are way too low.	N
AnI've known Hal for a number of years, going back to the days that he servein the New Mexico House of Representatives anthen as attorney general of the State of New Mexico.	D
Anclearly, Mr. Chairman anMembers, if you want somebody who is active, who will participate, who has a lot of energy, you've got the right person.	D
So from my standpoint, I think the President chose a person that is just right for the job.	D
I think he is ready to be the Chairman anprovide the kinof leadership that is obviously missing annecessary in this consumer-orienteinstitution of our national government.	D
While he was serving the people of New Mexico, he attaineanpreserveanwas appropriately complimentefor his willingness to protect the interests of all New Mexicans.	D
I have no doubt that he will carry this trait with him into the CPSC, this same commitment to ensuring the safety of American consumers.	D
He's trying diligently to finish the energy bill on the floor, on which he's doing a very goojob.	D
But I understanhe will communicate, if he hasn't already, his support for the President's nominee.	N
I'm pleaseto be here, anI hope that you will interrogate as much as you neeto anexpeditiously report him out to the Senate for approval.	N
As I indicated, the Senate Commerce Committee is meeting on the confirmation hearing for Mr. HarolStratton.	N
As we know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission chairmanship is a position that's gone vacant far too long.	N
So long, in fact, that the statutory provision which allows the Consumer Product Safety Commission to operate with a quorum of two commissioners expires at the enof this month.	N
I'm sure that he anhis family are prouto be here today, anwhen I recognize Mr. Stratton, I will ask him to recognize his family.	N
As far as I'm concerned, with Pete Domenici anJeff Bingaman in your corner, you are running with the right crowd.	N
Let me just mention an area in particular that I want to explore with you, because we know of your background, anparticularly that this is a new area, this whole area of consumer product safety anconsumer safety that we're going to be discussing today.	D
You are known, of course, for your long-time interest in addressing free-market approaches to various questions in government.	N
You've been involvein foundations that address areas where free-market approaches are stressed.	D
I want to make it clear that I think that those are very fine animportant principles, that free-market initiatives are critically important to our country.	N
However, the Consumer Product Safety Commission really came into being because the free-market alone wouldn't address many of the concerns that children, older people, anthe disablehave with respect to consumer protection.	N
So what I'like to do is explore with you your sense of what is the proper role of the federal government anwhat are the areas where consumers have responsibilities.	N
I look forwarto your statement anhaving a chance to visit with you a bit this afternoon as we examine your nomination.	N
I'm trying to understana bit about how you wouladminister the CPSC analso what your objectives woulbe.	N
You describeseveral of them, including consultation with other agencies anconsumer education.	N
The first question is why do you want to be the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission?	N
Well, the reason I'm asking the question is--I guess it's a philosophic question, really, in terms of consumer products anso forth.	N
Several decades ago, Mr. Nader raisethe question of unsafe automobiles, anwe went through a long perioof debate about these issues.	N
The automobile he raisequestions about caught fire when it was rear-endebecause of the way the fuel tank was placed.	N
He has since become a consumer advocate, anI'm just curious how you view--perhaps I shouldn't have useRalph Nader, per se--but how do you view the consumer advocates out there, perhaps symbolizeby him?	N
If one is a pro-business, free-market person, one, perhaps, comes down on the side of saying, you know, ``I don't like this notion of intrusion anconstantly taking on those that are making these products, whether it's chilseats or automobiles, for that matter.''	N
We, of course, will want someone in the Consumer Product Safety Commission who says, ``Look, I'm here on behalf of the American consumer anthe American public, paiby taxpayers' dollars, anI'm going to be a tiger on these issues of demanding that products be safe; anwhen not safe, I'm going to take on the companies who produce them.''	N
Tell us, if you would, a bit about what you dias attorney general of New Mexico, because most attorneys general, of course, are the top consumer advocates in their states.	N
Your office, perhaps, as the office in North Dakota anmany others do, hathe charge of consumer protection.	N
Mr. Stratton, perhaps because of where I come from, I've never considerethe issue of art fraud.	N
I think I understanwhat you mean, coming from New Mexico anserving as attorney general.	N
I askeyou to recite what you hadone with respect to consumer protection as attorney general, anI'm aware of your accomplishments because I've revieweyour record, but I wanteyou to be able to put it on the record, as well.	N
There is one thing that I reaabout you that concerneme just a bit, anI woullike you to responto it.	N
When you were attorney general, you wrote to the Wall Street Journal, taking your fellow attorneys general to task on an issue of merger guidelines, an area of business regulation.	D
You said, quote: ``They are using the cover of `consumer protection' to impose their anti-business, pro-government-regulation views on the entire nation anare bypassing the legislative process to put in place `enforcement guidelines' that Congress itself refuses to pass.''	N
Then there was a ``compact'' dealing with horizontal corporate mergers in which 44 attorneys general signed, but you dinot, saying, ``We have enough government interference in our economy without a new group joining the anti-business parade.''	D
However, the heaof the Consumer Product Safety Commission has to be a tiger anan advocate on behalf of consumers with respect to product safety.	N
When a business produces a product that's unsafe, we neesomeone that's going to move very quickly.	N
It won't be considerepro-business to move quickly against those that produce an unsafe product, but it will be considerepart of the charter of the heaof the CPSC.	N
So if you will, responto me on the two issues that I just raisethat were also part of the briefing here.	N
Those were both when you were attorney general, anyour statements with respect to them suggest a slightly different mindset than when I askethe question about being pro-business.	N
We all know how important the Consumer Product Safety Commission is, anwe neeyou there for it to be working with all of its members.	N
As the Chairman knows, the 6-month statutory deadline that allows the CPSC to perform its duties with only two commissioners expires on May 1, so it's important that we move as quickly as possible.	N
I didn't quite get your explanation on the airline advertising, but I'll accept it anyway, Mr. Stratton.	N
Ancongratulations, again, not only for this appointment, but your previous service to the State of New Mexico, of which Arizona was once part of the New Mexico Territory, as you recall.	D
There's no question in my minthat there are instances of products that are defective that you've really got to stanup for the consumer for, anyou've got to do it even if people aren't using them perfectly, because the worldoesn't always play out that way.	N
Let me ask you, along the same lines that I talkeabout earlier, with respect to free-market principles, where you wouldraw the line between voluntary standards anmandatory standards at the Commission?	N
As you know, the Commission tries to use voluntary standards to the greatest extent possible.	N
At the same time, there have got to be instances where you do use the mandatory approach, which, of course, carries the force of law.	N
When, in your view, in terms of just conceptually, do you think mandatory standards are appropriate?	N
You've got big decisions coming up at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, decisions with respect to arsenic anvarious kinds of materials that children may come in contact with on playgrounds.	D
You cannot prejudge any of those, anI don't want to ask you to do so today, but I think it woulbe very helpful in terms of getting a sense of how you woulapproach these kinds of questions, whether there are certain principles--other than the Act, of course, anI appreciate your earlier answers where you've made it clear that you're committeto following the Act--but tell us, if you would, given the fact that there are some big decisions coming up, give us a sense of how you're going to go about tackling them, recognizing that you certainly can't comment on things like that at this point.	N
The only other question I wanteto ask today--most of your previous record, you know, relates to consumer fraud.	N
But the Consumer Product Safety Commission really isn't aimeprimarily at outright fraud.	N
It's obvious that products can be unsafe even if manufacturers are well intentioneanhonest.	N
What woulyou cite as your big consumer accomplishments up to this point, other than in areas combating fraud?	N
Well, let me wrap up, then, by saying, given the limiteresources at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, you're going to have to make some choices.	D
And, if you would, wrap up for me by saying a little bit about what principles you'use in setting your priorities, if confirmed, at the CPSC.	N
I think you have an outstanding record, both in the private sector anin public service, having serveas the attorney general of New Mexico, anI think you'll make an outstanding Chairman anCommissioner on the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	D
In this Committee, we're very actively involvein consumer affairs, anlook forwarto working with you.	N
AnI see nothing in your background, really, that needs any clarification, in my judgment.	D
AnI just want to congratulate you on your accomplishments to date, thus far, anI hope you have smooth sailing through the process here.	D
As we have obviously peruseall of the records that have been submitteto us about your backgrounanyour work, there is one question regarding your role as the president of a non-profit organization, the Rio Grande Foundation.	D
On its website, in the announcement of its creation it states: ``The Rio Grande Foundation promotes public policy foundeupon the principle of limitegovernment, economic freedom, anindividual responsibility.''	N
In the context of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which, by its charter, is not about limitegovernment, it's about using that agency to take a look at all the businesses that are producing products antrying to finthose that are putting unsafe products on the market anprevent that from happening.	N
So describe to me how one reconciles what this organization, the non-profit, says, anwhat the role of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman requires anhow you will straddle that.	N
I mean, there are some who feel that if someone produces an unsafe product, it means that eventually people will experience it being unsafe annot purchase it, anthe free-market actually will ultimately correct itself.	N
We have some--not in Congress, fortunately--but we have some people writing to us saying there ought not be inspection of meat, for example.	N
If people are producing unsafe meat making people sick, eventually no one will buy from them anthat's the way to resolve this, through the free-market system.	N
I wouldn't want someone like that to come to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, anyour responses today tell me that that's certainly not your view.	N
We hope that we have a Consumer Product Safety Commission that is active, aggressive, anthat, at the enof the term of the new Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, that we can look back ansay, this was a person that was a real tiger on issues where the American consumers, anespecially children, were being injureby unsafe products.	D
He used, or she used, the tools of that office aggressively aneffectively relative to the charter of that Commission.	N
Speaking for myself, that woulbe my aspiration, anI believe of others on the Committee, as well.	N
Again, with all of those who come to the call of public service, our country thanks those who offer themselves to public service.	D
Our Committee will certainly evaluate your response today, but your responses have been very helpful to me, I must say.	D
Let me include in the recora statement by the Full Committee Chairman, Senator Hollings, who was not able to be at this hearing.	N
I believe we perhaps, also have some questions that we will want to direct anask that you responin writing.	D
And, as I said, I think your responses have been helpful to us, anyou've been very forthcoming.	D
This morning's hearing is for the confirmation of the nomination of Mr. Steven Robert Blust as our new Federal Maritime Commissioner.	N
We are happy to have her here, anpleaseto have you in attendance, anthank you for allowing him to serve.	N
The Federal Maritime Commission, as everyone here knows, is a very important, independent commission.	N
It is one that maybe the average person in Washington, the average person in the UniteStates, does not understand, or is not very familiar with, but for those who are interestein trade, trading opportunities, fair trade, anlevel playing fields in the international arena, the Federal Maritime Commission obviously is very, very important.	N
I want to congratulate Mr. Blust, you personally on your nomination, analso express my sincere appreciation on behalf of this Committee and, indeed, all Members of the Senate for your willingness to step out of the private sector aninto a job that I am certain will pay a lot less financially, in terms of financial reward, but in terms of the challenges anthe ability to do goothings for your country anyour nation, I know that it is a very rewarding challenge.	N
The current Chairman, Hal Creel, is a goofrienof this Committee ana goofrienof mine, serveon my staff as Counsel anStaff Director in his prior life.	D
I understanthat it is the President's desire that when you, Mr. Blust, join the Commission, you will begin service as the Chairman of the Commission.	D
Hal has done a terrific job, anwe appreciate his long service anthe recorthat he has establishein this very important position.	D
Sometimes these duties have to be carrieout with the honey ansugar approach, ansometimes you neeto use the 2x4 approach.	N
I think Hal has useboth, from talking nicely to our trading partners anour port authorities arounthe world, to threatening to close the Port of Japan.	N
We have done just about everything during your tenure, but that is the type of perspective that I think is needein this very important position.	D
I am delighted, Mr. Blust, that you are a person who comes to this nomination process with a great deal of professional credibility anbackground.	D
However, coming from your industry perspective, currently as manager of the Tampa Bay International Terminals, anprior to that, working for Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, the Port of Jacksonville, Crowley Maritime, Delta Steamship, angraduate of the Merchant Marine Academy.	D
You hathe goofortune of going to Louisiana, as Hal did, anreceiving an MBA degree at Tulane in New Orleans.	D
You obviously have the professional background, training, aneducational experience I think that is needein this job.	D
No one can suggest that you are just a political appointee that they founa place for in the Administration.	D
You are a professional, extremely well-qualifieindividual, anwe look forwarto having you in that position.	D
I understanthat Senator Bill Nelson from Florida was going to try anbe here, but since he is not able, he sends his regards.	N
Thank you, Mr. Blust, for being with us anfor, again, your willingness to serve in this position.	D
You mention in your statement the question of security and, of course, that is appropriately the buzz worin Washington, as it appropriately shoulbe today.	N
About security, we happen to believe that port security is something that shoulbe the highest priority.	N
We reporteout of this Committee amendments to that Act to make it even stronger, yet the House of Representatives has faileto--I am sorry, they dipass it last night.	N
Goonews, they passeit last night, so at least the House has now finally acted, so we ought to have a port security bill passeby the Senate anthe House anhopefully, the conference can come through with something quickly.	N
My point in raising this is, how do you envision the Federal Maritime Commission being helpful in this whole area?	N
As I have saiin the past, we are not just going to be able to allow the Coast Guarto do everything.	N
It seems that a lot of the ports ana lot of people in the shipping business feel that the Coast Guaris going to take care of port security.	N
It actually has to be local government officials, local port authorities, the Coast Guard, state police, the National Guard, port anharbor police, everybody has to be involved.	N
Now, I am wondering whether you envision any potential role for the Federal Maritime Commission in providing information, perhaps, to the Department of Transportation in terms of shipping contracts anwho is doing what, ancargo, ananything of that nature.	N
Is there anything that can come out of the Federal Maritime Commission that coulbe helpful in the area of security?	N
I woulcertainly encourage you to do that as Chairman, anHal being down there, it seems that a lot of the problems that we are seeing in intelligence information is due to a lack of sharing that information among the relevant agencies anthe government, the CIA not wanting to tell the FBI, the FBI not wanting to tell the state police, anpeople wanting to keep their information internally, ansometimes if that information is shared, the results will be far more positive in helping to stop things that shoulnot happen before they happen.	N
I woulreally encourage the FMC to take a look at everything you all do ansay, look, can anybody else benefit from this information?	N
You woulhate to finout that you hainformation internally that, hait gone to the proper law enforcement authorities from a criminal standpoint, or from an intelligence standpoint, may have preventeshipments from going someplace ancausing damage.	N
If you have information that shoulset off flags anbells anwhistles that something is wrong with this, we have never seen this carrier before in this trade, anis there something we neeto check here, ando not hesitate to do that.	N
Let me ask a question about this recent Supreme Court decision, which I happeneto reain the paper, anI see the staff has it listehere, about the cruise line that filesuit against the Port of South Carolina alleging discrimination in favoring one carrier over another carrier.	N
That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, anthe UniteStates Supreme Court, in a recent 5-4 decision, saithe FMC does not have jurisdiction to litigate against states, that the states are protecteagainst federal suits because of state sovereignty.	N
As I reathe Supreme Court decision, you are going to be prohibitefrom taking any action against any kinof state port authority.	N
You interpret the case to mean that the Federal Maritime Commission on its own initiative coulfile a complaint in Federal court against a State port authority for discrimination?	N
But you interpret that case to mean that in the same set of facts in the South Carolina case that was presenteat the Supreme Court, that hathe carrier just informethe FMC of discrimination, anthe FMC considerethat evidence, that the FMC on their own then coulfile a complaint in federal court?	N
That is an interesting idea, because you do not get that from reading the newspaper accounts of the case.	N
Well, Mr. Blust, we are joineby our Ranking Member from the great maritime state of Arizona.	N
The President has appointea terrific gentleman here who is a Merchant Marine graduate, John, anwith a great deal of experience in this business, to be Chairman.	D
I congratulate you, sir, on your nomination to be Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission.	N
With your years of experience serving in the maritime community, including your current position as President anCEO of Tampa Bay International Terminals, anyour previous experiences, you are well-qualified, I believe.	D
In your role, you will have the unique responsibility of setting the course the Commission takes over the next several years, anit will be important that, given the limiteresources, the priorities you establish are sounancarrieout in an efficient manner.	D
Over the past several years, the liberalizeexemption authority under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act has helpediminish this fear of collusion among carriers.	N
A more definecommercial market system is creating new openings to increase trade among nations.	N
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act has begun to show signs of success, anI woullike to see this pattern of deregulation continue.	N
The duties of the Commission are important to the daily functions of trade ancommerce in the UniteStates.	N
In the age of the global marketplace, you will be in a position that can help ensure fair maritime trading practices.	D
I am confident you will be up to the challenges in store for you both as a Commissioner anas a Chairman.	N
Exercising the duties of olage anlatitude on this Committee, I want to ask you what may be vieweby you as an off-the-wall question.	N
Why is it that every yacht of any size that I see in any port in America with an American name on it has a foreign flag, any large vessel that you see in any port?	N
It is because of the Jones Act, I am told, anthat is that if you want to have a crew on your yacht, then that crew has to be all American employees.	N
So all of these American yacht owners register their boats in Liberia, or the Cayman Islands, or some other place, so that they can have foreign-born anforeign citizens onboartheir ships.	N
Does the Maritime Commission get involvein the issue of flagging non-commercial vessels?	N
I was reading a story about Mr. Charles Taylor, the Liberian dictator who has been responsible for the deaths of thousands anthousands of people, I am told, in numbers, anaccording to several stories I have read, one of his major sources of revenue is from ships registereunder a Liberian flag.	N
Shoulit not bother you that ships owneby citizens of the UniteStates of America that operate carrying mainly U.S. goods anproducts arounthe worlshoulbe subsidizing ankeeping in power a ruthless dictator who--I mean, the crimes that they have committeare unspeakable.	N
Shoulwe not look at why the laws are such that we drive these ships to register in a God-awful place like Liberia?	N
I doubt if there is one Liberian citizen that has any interest of any kinin any of these ships.	N
Well, again, I understanthat it is out of the norm, but those two issues have bothereme for some time, anI congratulate you on your nomination, anI look forwarto working with you anSenator Breaux, who does represent a coastal State, who will be working with you more than I will, but I am sure you will enjoy that as well.	N
I again congratulate you on your nomination, anwe look forwarto having you at work as soon as possible.	N
During the port security hearing, it is interesting that one of the things we learnewas that Panama, which is also a flag of convenience where many of these ships are flagged, we actually caught them, the U.S. government, providing about a thousanfalse documents for Panamanian sailors on Panamanian ships.	N
I mean, you just go in there anpay your money, anyou get your documentation that you are a licensecrew person to serve on those vessels.	N
These vessels come into every port in the UniteStates, many of them with crews that have false documentation.	N
How easy it is for a potential terrorist to go down to Panama anpay the right person, get the documentation that you are a licenseseaman to sail on one of their vessels, anto come into the Port of New Orleans, or the Port of Long Beach, or anywhere else, ancause a great deal of damage.	N
Well, I thank the Senator for making that point, anMr. Chairman-to-be, congratulations, anwe will get to your confirmation just as soon as we can, anwith that, the hearing will stanadjourned.	N
This morning, our first order of business is going to be a hearing on the nomination of Rebecca Dye to be our new Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission.	N
Our frienancolleague, Senator TeStevens of Alaska is here, anunfortunately, Senator Stevens has a voice problem this morning.	N
His statement, recognizing his strong support for Ms. Dye anher distinguishework as a counsel for the House Transportation anInfrastructure Committee's Subcommittee on the Coast GuaranMaritime Transportation, will be made a part of the record.	D
We want to move quickly so Ms. Dye can get back to work on the port security legislation another matters that we are currently addressing.	N
We are delighteto have you here, anif you woullike to introduce any family members you have anpresent your statement to the Committee, we woulbe pleaseto proceed.	N
We haa previous hearing on the Chairman-to-be, Mr. Blust, anMr. Creel joineus as well.	N
If it just stays with the FMC anis not somehow sharewith some of the law enforcement agencies, whether it is the FBI or the new HomelanSecurity Department, it is very important information, anshoulnot just be pigeonholeanput in a box somewhere at the FMC.	N
You have access to information that coulbe exceedingly valuable, anI think we shoulmake sure we have a system whereby it is shareby those who neeto have it shared.	N
We probably have some additional questions we might submit to you, but for the moment I think that will suffice with my questions.	N
I take it that Senator Stevens, if he has questions, they woulbe submittein writing, anwe will operate under that format.	N
Mr. Chairman, I was searching the map this morning once again looking for oceans anports in West Virginia, anI faileto come up with any, so I only have to assume that I am going to vote for this nominee.	N
Senator Nelson seems to be on a tight time schedule, anhe'like to make some comments anintroduce one of the nominees, anwe'll recognize him for that purpose.	N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, anit is my pleasure to be here on behalf of FreGregory.	N
NASA is this wonderful little $15-billion-a-year agency that encapsulates the hopes anthe dreams anthe desires of the American people.	N
What child, what student, can you not fina way to interest them in science anmathematics antechnology by talking to them about the space program?	N
That is just one of the reasons that it's so very important that we have the right kinof management for NASA.	N
I believe that the right person for Deputy Administrator, the number-two position in the agency, is FreGregory.	N
He has vast experience with NASA, having come to NASA as a--anretiring--Colonel in the UniteStates Air Force after he hahaa career logging 7,000 hours in more than 50 types of aircraft, including 550 combat missions in Vietnam.	D
Frecame to NASA as a pilot astronaut, anI can tell you that they pick only the best of the best.	D
In that capacity, Frehas flown three missions, one in the right seat as pilot, antwo in the left seat as commander.	D
He serveas Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Flight, in an acting capacity, anthen he was selectepermanently in that position in February of this year.	D
He was responsible in that position of management in overseeing the International Space Station, Space Shuttle operations, space access using expendable launch vehicles for commercial launch services, space communications, anadvanceprograms.	D
Before that, he was an Associate Administrator of the Office of Safety anMission Assurance.	D
In this capacity, he was responsible for assuring the safety, reliability, quality, anmission assurance of all NASA programs.	D
That post is particularly important to NASA after awful mistakes on the Apollo launch pacausea fire that killethree astronauts.	N
Mistakes occurreagain in January of 1986, which resultein the Challenger disaster ana renewecommittment to safety.	N
Now, you've hearme, Mr. Chairman, from this very position on this very Committee, keep saying over anover that we have got to finthe resources in NASA to do the safety upgrades in the Space Shuttle, because we shoulnever get to a position where we compromise safety.	N
Anso it woulgive me--anI bring to the Committee for its consideration--a great deal of assurance of having someone like Freas the Deputy Administrator so that, as attuneas he is, not only to the astronaut corps, but as experienceas he is having been the heaof safety for NASA, it is a very, very important component of how NASA ought to be managethese days.	D
So, Mr. Chairman, I bring to you an astronaut, a test pilot, a manager of flight safety programs, anlaunch support operations.	N
Today, the Committee is going to consider the nominations of FreGregory to be Deputy Administrator of NASA, anKathie Olsen anRicharRussell to be Associate Directors in the White House Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
In particular, we address the three nominees with your prospective bosses, Sean O'Keefe, John Marburger, anwe're glathat all of you are here.	N
I do want to say that all three of these individuals in this panel seem eminently qualified.	D
What you'll hear from me most of the time is, ``Remember the aeronautics aspect of NASA.''	N
Anso while you may be concerneabout the Space Station, let us not forget the importance of research andevelopment anmaking sure our country stays in the lead, or at least be competitive with the Europeans anthe Japanese, as far as research in aeronautics.	N
AnI know that Chairman Wyden anI have hahearings in our Subcommittee referencing that.	N
But, Mr. Chairman, my main purpose here is to share with you my pleasure in the nomination of Mr. RicharRussell, as nominateby the President, to be Associate Director of the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
His wife, Lynley, is here, holding little George Wolverton there, who's reading now, as opposeto voting for his father.	N
Lynley's father, his father-in-law, Dr. Ogilvie, is here anhis aunt, Mrs. Sloan is here, as well, anwe welcome you all here, backing up Richard.	N
Just so you all know, Mr. Russell is a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, calling Fairfax County his home.	N
He's a son of a career foreign service officer, who gainethe rank of Ambassador before retiring.	D
Mr. Russell ditravel the worlextensively growing up himself, but, showing great judgment, always returneto Virginia.	D
I'm pleasethat we're going to have an individual with his technological expertise as one of the leaders in the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	D
Virginia is one of the fastest growing technology communities, as is Oregon, so we share those similarities.	N
I think that as you, Mr. Chairman, anI have workeon NET Guard, anhopefully we'll get that through very shortly, there's an understanding that much of what we neeto do in homelansecurity can be performewith the adaptation anthe implementation of gooideas that are already out there in the private sector anadapt them to our needs in law enforcement ancyber-security antransportation anelsewhere.	N
Now, as the White House officer responsible for giving advice on these matters of science antechnology, I think that Mr. Russell is going to play a very important role in setting these Federal policies that'll facilitate the continuegrowth animplementation of technology, not just from Virginia, but obviously from all over our country.	D
Prior to the President's nominating him to this post, Mr. Russell serveas the Chief of Staff of OSTP.	D
He also joineOSTP from the House Committee on Science, which was a really great Committee in those days with Congressman Walker.	D
Anduring his 6 years on the Committee, he rose through the ranks from Professional Staff to Staff Director of the Technology Subcommittee, later to Deputy Chief of Staff for the Full Committee.	D
In those capacities, Mr. Russell workeon a broaarray of legislation anpolicies impacting technology development, including technology workforce issues, computer security research, Y2K antechnology transfer.	D
Much of what's going to neeto be done in the area of cyber-security, I think, will neeto be analyzein some of the ways we analyzeY2K compliance anthe capability of achieving that once the year 2000 came, the capability of systems to meet that change in the date.	N
The same needs to be done as standards in determining whether or not agencies are secure from cyber-	N
I can't think of a better addition, Mr. Chairman, to this important office than Mr. Russell.	D
And, in fact, the American Association of Engineering Societies, whose representation has over a million engineers nationwide, saithis, anI quote: ``His leadership on information technology, research andevelopment, anon other issues makes us confident that Mr. Russell is the right man for the job.	D
He shares our mission of using technology, be it from the private or public sector, to make our country safer anour economy more robust.''	D
We look forwarto working with you, anI hope our Committee approves him in on the floor as quickly as possible.	N
If you couljust summarize your principal concerns, anthen we're going to begin the questions with Senator McCain, because I know he's on a tight schedule.	N
It's something that we began to address in this Committee years ago, anunfortunately the budget has now lurchecompletely out of control.	N
I'like to know if you agree or disagree when you begin, because I'like you to start out by answering the question.	N
I woullike to know whether you agree or disagree with that question, or don't answer the question.	N
Mr. Russell, do you agree or disagree with this summary of the ``Climate Change Impacts on the UniteStates'' report?	N
I will oppose both of your nominations until we get an answer to a simple, basic question, anI'll see if you'll answer----	N
I woullike you to answer the question whether you agree or disagree with that statement.	N
It's a pretty straightforwarstatement, anI woullike to know if you agree or disagree.	N
Anit is unusual, by the way, to have witnesses, particularly here for confirmation, not to answer a rather simple straightforwarquestion.	N
In Dr. Marburger's statement before the Committee on July 11th, Dr. Marburger said, anI quote: ``This is why reports such as the 2002 Climate Action Report do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.	N
That report employs `scenarios' that are inventeto capture the range of results of multiple runs of different climate models with different ahoc input assumptions.	N
The scenarios are then useto make `projections,' a worthat is carefully definein an important footnote . . . of the report . . .	N
I fear that many readers of the Climate Action Report have mistaken its `projections' for forecasts.''	N
By the way, the quote I gave you was from the ``Climate Change Impacts on the UniteStates,'' not the ``Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Key Questions,'' anit doesn't matter whether you've reait or not; it's a straigthforwarstatement, anI woullike to know if you agree or disagree.	N
Now, have you reapage three of the report, which says, quote: ``By how much will temperatures change over the next 100 years anwhere?''	N
The answer: ``Climate change simulations for the perio1990 to 2100, baseon the IPCC emissions scenarios, yiela globally-	N
averagesurface temperature increase by the enof the century of 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius, (2.5 to 10.4 degrees Farenheit), relative to 1990.	N
The wide range of uncertainty in these estimates reflects both the different assumptions about future concentrations of greenhouse gases anaerosols in the various scenarios considereby the IPCC anthe differing climate sensitivities of various climate models usein the simulation.''	N
Quote: ``The range of climate sensitivities implieby these predictions is generally consistent with previously reportevalues.''	N
Yet Dr. Marburger states that this report doesn't make predictions, when clearly, on page three, it says, anI quote again: ``The range of climate sensitivities implieby these predictions is generally consistent with the previous reportevalues.''	N
Well, then why is it that Dr. Marburger said--anI'm sorry that I hato leave the hearing early--``That's why reports such as the 2002 U.S. Climate Action Report do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.''	N
But Dr. Marburger says this is why reports such as the 2002 U.S. Climate Action Report ``do not claim to make predictions about future impacts.''	N
I notewith interest that neither you nor Mr. Russell, as part of your heavy responsibilities that you hope to assume, mentioneanything about climate change.	D
To begin the process within this Administration, the President last year--``The changes observeover the last several likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out some significant part of these changes are due to a reflection of natural variability.''	N
Over the 20th century, the average annual U.S. temperature has risen by almost 1 degree Farenheit, (0.6 degrees Celsius), anprecipitation has increasenationally by 5 to 10 percent, mostly due to increases in heavy downpours.	N
The science indicates that the warming in the 21st century will be significantly greater than in the 20th century.	N
Scenarios examinein this assessment, which assume no major interventions to reduce''--which is apparently what you countenance--``no major interventions to reduce continuegrowth to worlgreenhouse gas emissions indicate that temperatures in the U.S. will rise by about 5-9 degrees Farenheit, (3-5 degrees Celsius), on average, in the next 100 years, which is more than the projecteglobal increase.''	N
Well, what this is all about is one of the more astonishing statements that I've seen before this Committee.	N
Over this past several years, we have haa series of hearings before this Committee on climate change, the best scientific evidence from all over the world, as well as the country, anthere is near unanimous--not unanimous--near unanimous agreement that climate change is taking place anthat human activity is responsible for a significant part of it.	N
AnDr. Marburger comes before this Committee anstates that we don't have the ability to predict that there are questions that are significant about whether we can even predict more than a few days, the climate, anit was probably one of the more astonishing performances.	N
The President, by the way, as you describeall the other things, disay that, yes, he reathis bureaucratic product, or something along those lines--basically dismisseit.	N
There are Members of this Committee that have been working on this issue for a long time, including me.	N
To wit, in South Africa there will be a meeting of some 60 nations early in September trying to work our way through this issue so that we can reduce this direct threat to our environment.	N
Ansince the UniteStates produces 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, with 5 percent of the population, we think we do have some responsibilities there.	N
Unfortunately, there will be only a congressional representation there as real participants.	N
So I can see that, from Dr. Marburger's statements anyours, Dr. Olsen, that we have a very serious challenge, because there is no credibility to Dr. Marburger's statement.	N
Anmy disappointment in yours, not being able to understana single paragraph angive me a definitive answer, is also very disappointing.	N
AnI've very disturbethat Dr. Marburger woulcome forwarwith a statement such as he did.	N
we will have further hearings, anI'm sure Dr. Marburger will have a chance to defenhis position.	N
I think any way you look at it, we are basically alone out there with respect to 180 other nations.	N
The irony for this Senator is that there are a number of them out there that are bipartisan.	N
For example, we've founrepeatedly that carbon sequestration programs, programs that are supporteby the environmentalists, by the timber industry, couldeal with perhaps a quarter of the global warming problem in a way that is going to win bipartisan support--Senator Craig, Senator Brownback--a whole host of Senators have been involvein this.	N
But we're not going to be able to get on top of any real progress in programs unless we acknowledge the seriousness of the science.	N
Let me just finish up on this topic, before we go to some others, with a couple of questions.	N
Do the two of you, Dr. Olsen anMr. Russell, do you support the proposition that human activities are a significant factor in the climate change problem?	N
Then I'll just wrap up this topic, Dr. Olsen, by asking you to explain the Administration's policy anwhy you think it's going to reduce greenhouse gas intensity.	N
Now, as you know, the heaon the Council on Environmental Quality has saithat this position is going to allow U.S. emissions to rise.	N
I think we woullike to have on the recorwhy you believe that the Administration's position is going to address climate change in a positive way.	N
We'll keep the recoropen for your answer, but I will tell you, I think it is very unfortunate that we can't get an acknowledgment of the science here.	N
In fact, it's not clear to me what, in effect, we're going to do other than to try to convince them that somehow we're right anthey're wrong, because I think that they have clearly concludeotherwise.	N
I think that you're goopeople anpeople who have a distinguishecareer in public service.	D
So we'll expect, in future appearances, that you're able to address these issues in a more comprehensive way.	D
We're going to go on to some other topics, but this will not be the last time we talk about this in this Committee.	N
The General Accounting Office issuea report yesterday on the Space Station with respect to significant challenges that they believe continue.	N
Is it going to continue to be a work in progress, or when are we going to get a final plan?	N
Now, the ReMAP effort, the Research Maximization anPrioritization task force--that is a mouthful--put out a new report making various recommendations.	N
But, to me, the real question is how soon is it going to be possible to move the Space Station beyonbeing a great engineering feat into a research program?	N
When Administrator O'Keefe was here last, we haa big group of high school students in the back, anI askehim a question essentially about students in space.	N
Anif a student met every single one of the requirements--every one of them--for mission specialists that are requiretoday, what woulbe wrong with that?	N
After Administrator O'Keefe gasped, anyou coulsee it, you know, in his face, he saithat he'look into it.	N
How do you feel about having a research program that woulreally determine how we coulget young people more inspireanmore involvein space, including looking at the question of if they met all of the requirements of a mission specialist, including being alloweto go?	N
If those young people are going to fight in battlefields all arounthe world, it seems to me, if they're qualified, they shouldn't be cut off from these opportunities either.	D
We're talking about people who can go fight in Afghanistan anwho can go out andefenthis country, whether, if they're qualified, they coulbe a mission specialist.	N
I woulonly hope that the agency woulsay that if you're qualified, if you meet all of the bottom-line requirements, your government isn't going to holyou back.	D
The government is going to be looking for ways in which you tap your potential, particularly when you can have scientists anyoung people, like we saw in this room when Mr. O'Keefe was talking about it.	N
I just even startethe question, anthese young people who were studying science broke into applause.	N
We ought to give them a reason to dream, not to have sort of silly ideas that children at little-league age can go to space or something like that, but that if you can go fight for your country anyou can meet the qualifications requireof a mission specialist, age alone shouldn't rule you out.	N
I don't want the agency to start anything tomorrow or the next day or the next day, but I want the agency to research it.	N
I mean, really, I think all I wanteto convey is let's do the research, anlet's tap all of our opportunities.	N
There has been concern about the Administration's intention to nominate two rather than four Associate Directors of OSTP.	N
The concern is that the Administration wouldn't have the Associate Director positions for national security anfor the environment that were present before.	N
They're important ones, as you know, given energy bill's efforts to try to deal with it, anwe're anxious to work with you on it, but we've got to get those issues to visibility anthe attention that's important.	N
For you, Mr. Russell anDr. Olsen, let's talk about the coordination between your offices anthe new Department of HomelanSecurity.	N
I want to preface this by saying that Dr. Marburger anall of those associatewith your organization have been very helpful, very constructive to us in working on our efforts to mobilize science antechnology experts in the homelansecurity effort.	D
Tell us, if you would, how you see OSTP anthe new HomelanSecurity Department interacting ancoordinating, particularly research andevelopment across the agencies.	N
Mr. Russell, how woulyou put the current troubles of the technology sector in perspective?	N
As you know, it wasn't very many years ago when few woulsay we'see the kinof problems in the tech sector we're seeing now.	N
What do the current struggles say to you about the role of technology anthe economy anthe potential of technology to spur productivity?	N
Does the crisis in the tech sector require any major changes in the way government thinks about technology policy, in your view, Mr. Russell?	N
Dr. Olsen, as you coultell, anI welcomeyour statement, I want to see a much more aggressive effort to get women in the harsciences.	N
You've got a track recorin this area anyou've serveas a Federal representative for the Commission on the Advancement of Women anMinorities that was establisheby the Congress in 1998, anyou made recommendations, as I understanit, to help achieve the objectives.	D
What were some of the things you fought for, the areas that you really pursueas a commission member?	N
Are there other new initiatives or new programs that you'like to pursue in your new position to go after these big disparities?	N
Mr. Gregory, the NASA program is going to put a new focus on education, anI think it's very welcome.	N
How woulyou like to go about encouraging more women to get into science anengineering?	N
I also hope that you all will really set out some goals so that we have a chance to measure which programs are not working anwhich programs are making a difference.	N
We've talketo the Administrator about it, anwe'll hope to have your support for that, as well.	D
On the government labs, I think we know that a lot of the laboratories in the facilities which support government scientific enterprises were built decades ago, 40, 50 years ago, anare in tremendous disrepair.	N
What woulyou see as your role, as your office's role, in helping to put in place a plan to get the upgrades annecessary improvements done?	N
I think you, Dr. Olsen, anyou, Mr. Russell, understanthat Senator McCain has some concerns on the climate change question.	N
I want us to understanthat the science here is no longer in question; it is indisputable.	N
I want to see the remedies to the problems--one along the lines that I mentioned--that will be supporteon a bipartisan basis in the U.S. Senate that will bring together people across the political aneconomic spectrum, as we've been able to do in carbon sequestration.	N
I think that once we can get on top of an acknowledgment with respect to the science anwhat humans contribute anthe other underpinnings of the science question, then we can begin to go to the next level, which is to talk about programs that are constructeanwell thought out anpractical.	N
But Senator McCain has indicatethat he can't support the two of you, Dr. Olsen, anyou, Mr. Russell, at this time, so I hope you can get back to Senator McCain, address his concerns.	N
I want to see all three of you confirmeas soon as we possibly can, anI think that is Chairman Hollings' desire as well.	N
This is not a huge surprise that there are disagreements between some of us on the this side of the dais anin the Administration on the climate change question.	N
But I do think that on some of the fundamental science questions, we've got to acknowledge common ground.	N
Once we do that, then we go to the next level, anpeople like me are anxious to meet the Administration halfway as we have done so consistently in a variety of areas.	N
It ought to be driven by the dreams anhopes of scientists anat lab benches another facilities.	N
This afternoon, the Committee will consider the nomination of Jonathan Adelstein to be Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.	N
Mr. Adelstein currently serves as an advisor to our esteemeSenate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle.	D
I'like to take this moment to welcome Mr. Adelstein anask him to introduce to the Committee his family members anfriends who have accompaniehim today.	N
I thank you very much, anI'like to welcome the members of the family ancongratulate them.	N
I think Mr. Adelstein will play an important role in guiding American telecommunications policy in the digital age, anI think he's fully qualifiefor performing those duties despite the years of service that he spent with Senator Daschle.	D
I hathe pleasure of meeting with Mr. Adelstein recently, anfounhim to be thoughtful ancommitteto serving consumer interests.	N
I commenhim on his career in public service, anI appreciate his willingness to undertake the tremendous responsibility of serving as an FCC Commissioner.	D
I am grateful to have the opportunity to appear before you, anI have a formal statement that, with your consent, I woullike inserteinto the record.	N
Let me just say that it is a great day for our country ancertainly a proumoment for me.	N
It is especially an honor that so many of the Adelstein family has come for this special occasion.	N
But I must say, in all my time in public life, I have never presentea nominee with greater confidence anwith greater enthusiasm.	N
I know him as someone who is ready to responto the challenges that Senator McCain so eloquently just described.	N
We have a big challenge at the FCC, anI know of no one who can do it better than Jonathan Adelstein.	N
So it's a pleasure for me to be at his side on this special occasion, on this important day.	N
I thank the Committee, anI thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your willingness to holthis hearing so that we can move to meet these challenges in the near future.	N
Anlet me begin by thanking Chairman Hollings for calling this important hearing on the nomination of Jonathan Adelstein to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission.	N
I want to thank you anSenator Hollings, Senator McCain, for participating in this overdue hearing today.	N
Mr. Chairman, if I coulask unanimous consent to insert a letter by the Governor of South Dakota, Governor Bill Janklow, in support of the nominee in the recorat this point.	N
Coulwe say, we know that the other Senators have important duties, anwe thank you for appearing on behalf of this witness.	N
As a South Dakotan, I think I have two of the best Senators in the U.S. Senate, with all due respect to the current Members here.	N
Senator McCain, I appreciate your generous comments, as well, anI enjoyehaving the chance to talk to you about critical telecommunications issues.	N
I'm also grateful to President Bush for sending my nomination forward, analso to Governor Bill Janklow for his stalwart support throughout this entire process.	N
Finally, I'like to say a worto my fellow Members of the Senate staff, the crowwho's sitting behinyou on the dais, where I sat for so many years myself.	N
Without the work that we've done together, without the help of you, my friends, my colleagues, anmy mentors, I woulnot be prepareto pursue this opportunity.	N
Senator Daschle also chargeme with helping to develop a comprehensive congressional technology agenda which Senator Daschle anRepresentative Dick Gephardt unveilelive on the Internet in April, 2001.	N
It containea detaileseries of proposals to spur innovation, productivity, economic growth anjob creation.	N
This effort requireextensive consultation with each of the many Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over technology issues anthe many Members of Congress with an interest in these issues.	N
This exercise helpeme establish a broavision for promoting U.S. technological development in which the FCC, along with many other Federal agencies, plays an important role.	N
I have also workewith Senator Daschle on initiatives to promote efficient spectrum management, improve the availability of local-to-	N
local television service to all regions of the U.S., anto establish the validity of electronic signatures annumerous of other telecommunications initiatives.	N
As Senator Daschle's leading banking anfinancial services advisor, I have also gainea soliunderstanding of the operations anstructure of the capital markets, which remain crucial in the financing andevelopment of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure overseen by the FCC.	N
For example, I workeon every aspect of the landmark legislation to revamp the financial services industry, the Gramm-Leach-	N
This experience provideme with great perspective on the, latest developments in a fielwhich plays a key role in the future of the telecommunications industry.	N
Moreover, I have participatein the multi-year effort to enact bankruptcy reform, the commercial aspects of which are unfortunately playing an increasingly prominent role in the structuring of the telecommunications industry.	N
In my previous staff position for the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I undertook a number of in-depth investigations anorganizea number of hearings, many of which leto changes in Federal law or reforms of executive agency practices anorganizational structures.	N
This experience in exploring the depths of complex issues, anlearning how to conduct Federal investigations anorganize fact-finding hearings will help me, if confirmed, to evaluate the complex fielof telecommunications.	N
Moreover, this oversight experience providevaluable insight into the management of large ancomplex Federal agencies anhow to address bureaucratic problems that can have an adverse effect on the public which relies on those agencies.	N
In this position, I also learnefirst-hanthe importance of affordable telecommunications services to senior citizens antheir families.	N
I serveas the primary advisor to Senators Pryor anRiegle on some of the largest programs in the Federal budget which fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee on which they served.	N
This responsibility rapidly developemy ability to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal programs, initiate specific proposals for improving them anforge a bipartisan consensus in order to get changes enacteor otherwise approveby Federal agencies.	N
This experience woulaime, if confirmed, in confronting the many challenges to the efficient functioning of the FCC.	N
My undergraduate angraduate education focuseon how American history, political science, economics anpublic policy analysis coulbe employeto improve the functioning of government.	N
My political science studies at Stanford, followeby my studies there to attain a Masters in history, helpeme to better understanthe context in which government decisions were being made.	N
I furtheremy studies at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where I gainevaluable lessons in economics, statistics anpublic policy analysis.	N
In sum, I have hathe privilege of studying anserving in capacities that have providea unique level of experience, exposure aneducation about Federal Government processes, including those involving telecommunications policy.	N
I have dedicatemy career to public service in the U.S. Senate, working for some of its finest members.	N
I can imagine no greater training grounto prepare an individual for the enormous responsibility of implementing the complex anoften disputetelecommunications laws enacteby Congress.	N
Public service has affordeme the opportunity to make some concrete contributions to what I, anthe members I served, considereto be in the public interest.	N
This country anmy home State of South Dakota have given so much to me anmy family that no amount of giving back in the form of public service can ever repay the gratitude I feel.	N
My father's family founsafe haven here from the pogroms in Russia arounthe turn of the century.	N
My greatgrandmother homesteadenear the Badlands of South Dakota, anmy grandfather went on from there to founa business that became one of the largest employers in the state.	N
Now, baseon the extraordinary opportunities aneducation I have been affordein the Senate anat fine educational institutions, I woullike to use my experience to promote the public interest as envisioneby Congress in its communications laws.	N
The FCC has before it perhaps the most exciting challenges of any agency in promoting the development of telecommunications aninformation technologies anservices during a time of economic difficulty in the industry ansecurity threats to our country.	N
I woullike to work towarachieving bipartisan solutions that maximize the ability of the Commission to contribute to productivity, economic growth animprovesecurity for the entire country.	N
Having been born anraisein one of the most rural states in the country, South Dakota, angiven my experience working on behalf of South Dakota for 7 years in Senator Daschle's office, I see the value of quality communications anmedia services in people's lives.	N
My experience has taught me that these services can make a positive contribution to economic development, education, public safety, anthe quality of health care services available to people in need.	N
In rural areas like the one where I was raised, the availability of the most advancecommunications technology can determine whether a small community can offer an economic future to its citizens, ancan even mean the difference between life andeath in the case of medical emergencies.	N
It is also clear that enhancing the quality of the nationwide telecommunications infrastructure improves the overall economy by increasing the productivity anefficiency of the entire nation.	N
If confirmed, serving at the Commission will provide me with an opportunity to promote the transforming power of communications anmedia services in people's lives.	N
The FCC has been chargeby Congress with a key role in fostering competition, innovation anuniversal service.	N
Advancetechnologies can connect people to new opportunities anobliterate the distances between them.	N
They can contribute to our quality of life, ankeep this country competitive in the global economy.	N
If confirmed, I will work with the other Commissioners anthe many talentepeople at the Commission to help improve the telecommunications economy anpromote the deployment of the most advancetechnologies to every region ansector of American society, as envisioneby the Telecommunications Act of 1996.	N
If confirmed, my goals are to work towarexpanding access to telecommunications services for all Americans, including broadbanservices, to help restore the economic vitality of the telecommunications sector, anto address emerging public safety ansecurity needs.	N
In pursuing these goals, I will strive to faithfully carry out the communications laws enacteby Congress, consistent with Congressional intent ascertainefrom a plain reading of the statute anits legislative history.	N
In order to accomplish this most effectively, I will work to keep open animprove communications with Members of Congress antheir staffs.	N
Working firmly within that framework, I will seek to realize the goal of improving the economic climate of the telecommunications industry, which is currently witnessing an historic downturn, so that continueinnovation, investment andeployment can improve the level of services available to consumers.	N
This effort can be accomplishein part by working towarthe statutory goal of the Act itself, which calls for extending the availability of advancetelecommunications technology to all Americans in all regions, including the ubiquitous deployment of broadband.	N
Finally, our country must have the most reliable ansountelecommunications infrastructure in order to meet new anemerging threats to our security.	N
Addressing the needs of the public safety community must remain at the very forefront of the Commission's agenda.	N
4. What skills do you believe you may be lacking which maybe necessary to successfully carry out this position?	N
It woulbe difficult for any individual to master the intricacies of all of those many areas of jurisdiction.	N
Recognizing these difficulties, despite my years of experience in this field, I will examine even more intensively the many issues arising before the Commission, taking advantage of the greater access to information available to Commission members.	N
I realize that many different challenges face the legislative branch anindependent regulatory agencies of government.	N
If confirmed, in making the transition to the FCC, I will neeto reach out to the many experienceanskillepublic servants within the Commission.	N
Moreover, I will also draw on the experience of leading outside experts, including those in academia anpublic interest groups, anthat of the many leaders in the telecommunications industry.	N
I will also reach out to regular consumers anresidents of rural areas to learn about their perspectives.	N
Telecommunications is a rapidly changing fielanI will neeto refine my knowledge constantly to keep abreast of these changes.	N
I am confident this can be accomplisheby drawing on the seasoneCommission staff anleading technologists from outside the agency.	N
Include a discussion of when you believe the government shoulinvolve itself in the private sector, when shoulsociety's problems be left to the private sector, anwhat standards shoulbe useto determine when a government program is no longer necessary.	N
The UniteStates was foundeupon a Constitution that carefully enumerates powers available to the Federal Government, anplaces limits on those powers.	N
The American Revolution was largely a response to abuses of power by an unaccountable king.	N
Emerging from this beginning, the U.S. has, historically anproperly, retainea skeptical view of the role of government power.	N
Most importantly, it vesteresponsibility for limiting the encroachment of government into the private sector anpeople's lives not only through the Bill of Rights, but through a soundemocracy.	N
For officials in a regulatory agency such as the FCC, it is imperative not to exceethe authority delegateto the agency by Congress when applying regulations to the private sector.	N
Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, anregulators must restrain themselves from using their congressionally delegateauthority to exceethe limits of congressional mandates.	N
I consider the necessity for such judicial action a failure to interpret congressional intent in implementing the law and, if confirmed, woulstrive to avoisuch failure.	N
In my view, which happens to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act, competition is preferable to regulation as a means of encouraging innovation, lowering prices animproving the quality anavailability of services to consumers.	N
Some sectors of the telecommunications industry are already witnessing a competitive market, while others are still making the transition.	N
A greater government role may be needeto facilitate competition in less open markets, angovernment action may be necessary to stimulate service in other instances in which the market fails to address essential societal goals, such as the deployment of the advanceservices to rural areas.	N
In these exceptional circumstances, to make markets work best, the government shouloperate in a fair, clear anopen manner, establishing frameworks that are technologically ancompetitively neutral.	N
The goal must always be to get to the point where market forces ancompetition render governmental regulation unnecessary.	N
Once that point is achieved, the regulatory environment shouldiminish deftly anappropriately.	N
In terms of when government programs are no longer necessary, section 10 of the Communications Act provides useful guidance.	N
This provision authorizes the Commission to discontinue applying regulations that are no longer needeto prevent discrimination or other unjust practices or charges, or to protect consumers.	N
This provision specifically requires the Commission to weigh whether or not eliminating a regulation coulenhance competition.	N
In general, I agree with the proposition that a program or regulation is no longer needewhen the market failure it was designeto correct has been addressed.	N
For example, the government has historically promoteuniversal service in areas such as postal service antelephone service.	N
It has also establishea national highway system, anpromoteuniversal access to electricity.	N
In these cases, government has workein close cooperation with the private sector to accomplish laudable goals.	N
Whenever possible, the government shoulattempt to work in partnership with the private sector to address policy goals in areas where competition or the market alone might not accomplish them to the satisfaction of policymakers in Congress.	N
It is a core, bipartisan American value that the government shoulact to secure universal service for its citizens.	N
This policy goal, when met, enhances the value of the telecommunications network for all who use it, whether as consumers or providers.	N
In your own words, please describe the agency's current missions, major programs, anmajor operational objectives?	N
The FCC is an independent regulatory agency createby the Communications Act of 1934 to oversee emerging communications technologies by wire anradio.	N
Its mission has been expandeby subsequent amendments to include television, satellite ancable.	N
It is chargewith carrying out the responsibilities conferreupon it by Congress to help ``all the people of the UniteStates'' benefit from the best telecommunications system possible, anto do so at reasonable rates.	N
In short, the FCC regulates radio antelevision broadcasters, wire common carriers, wireless ansatellite communications providers, as well as multichannel video programmers, anhelps coordinate international ansatellite policies.	N
The FCC oversees the administration of universal service support programs, including high-	N
It enforces the Communications Act requirements in these fields anhandles public inquiries anconsumer complaints.	N
The FCC's mission, as detailein the statute, is to facilitate competition, promote universal service antechnological innovation, anto protect the public interest.	N
Much of its recent activities has involveimplementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.	N
Operationally, the FCC currently oversees a vast array of regulations that it must continually enforce anevaluate in light of changing market conditions antechnological change.	N
It must also responto input from Congress, anto any changes that Congress enacts to its current mission.	N
In reference to question No. 6, what forces are likely to result in changes to the mission of this agency over the coming 5 years?	N
The FCC's fundamental mission will change only to the extent that Congress amends the laws governing the agency, or that competition develops in a manner that obviates the neefor regulation.	N
Even if such fundamental developments do not occur, however, in certain areas the agency will confront the neeto responto technological innovation, anto accommodate rising demanfor spectrum annew wireless technologies, as well as to responto significant changes in the marketplace that may emerge.	N
In further reference to question No. 6, what are the likely outside forces which may prevent the agency from accomplishing its mission?	N
While outside forces are presenting challenges to the FCC, I am hopeful none of them will prevent it from accomplishing its statutory mission.	N
One great outside challenge now facing the agency is that changes in revenue streams are placing pressure on universal service, which may complicate efforts to ensure its sustainability anto encourage the deployment of advanceservices.	N
Second, increasing demands on spectrum are straining the ability of the agency to balance the neeto promote the deployment of advancewireless telecommunications services with the essential needs of national security anpublic safety.	N
Third, the Commission will neeadequate resources to carry out its mission as the telecommunications environment grows ever more technologically complex.	N
It will be a challenge to attract anretain the best-trainespecialist&in the fields of telecommunications technology, economics, anlaw unless resources keep pace with the demands placeon the agency.	N
In further reference to question No. 6, what factors in your opinion have kept the department/agency from achieving its missions over the past several years?	N
The agency can improve communications with Congress so that emerging problems can be addressein the most cooperative manner possible.	N
In addition, the judicial review process has leincreasingly to inconsistent interpretations of the law, in some cases due to inadequate efforts to provide objective justification for some of the regulatory positions the agency has taken.	N
There is also a neeto show more dedication to expeditiously anresponsively addressing section 254 of the Telecommunications Act in light of the changing nature of the marketplace.	N
The primary stakeholders are residential anbusiness consumers of telecommunications services.	N
Congress, which createthe agency, is also a primary stakeholder which is accountable anresponsive to those consumers.	N
Telecommunications businesses that provide services to consumers are, of course, key stakeholders.	N
Others include the White House, relateexecutive branch agencies, State regulators, aninternational governments.	N
What is the proper relationship between your position, if confirmed, anthe stakeholders identifiein question No. 10?	N
It must act to preserve its independence if its decisions are to be regardeas objective anfair.	N
Given this position, the agency must always keep focuseon its mission, as embodiein the Communications Act, to protect consumers anpromote the public interest.	N
As such, it is imperative that Commissioners maintain close communications with Congress so as to reflect most accurately its intentions with regarto the law anattenmost efficiently to members' concerns as raiseby their various constituencies.	N
Commissioners shoulwork cooperatively with outside stakeholders, listen carefully to their concerns, anresponto those concerns in a manner consistent with the law.	N
Commissioners shoulhear anconsider fully the competing visions of the many providers of telecommunications services anevaluate what outcomes woulbest serve the public interest as intendeby the Act.	N
All stakeholders shoulbe hearantreatefairly, but none shoulbe granteany special treatment in terms of access or outcomes.	N
The Chief Financial Officers Act requires all government departments anagencies to develop sounfinancial management practices similar to those practicein the private sector.	N
(a) What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure your agency has proper management anaccounting controls?	N
If confirmed, I will consider it my responsibility to work closely with anoversee agency management anadministrative personnel, anhelp to ensure a clean audit.	N
The Act specifies that the Chairman is to serve as the chief executive officer of the Commission, anthe Commission has hirea Chief Financial Officer.	N
At the same time, all Commissioners are responsible for overseeing anassisting with the management of the agency in order to comply with statutory mandates.	N
I will seek to work closely with these officials to help establish the most effective organizational structure anthe most efficient use of the budgetary resources provideby Congress.	N
In terms of what will most closely fall under my purview if confirmed, I will employ diligence ancareful scrutiny in administering the resources of my office.	N
I have extensive experience in congressional oversight of large agencies, including committee oversight experience in evaluating the management of the over 60,000 employees of the Social Security Administration.	N
I also have extensive experience in the congressional budget process involving the entire Federal Government, as I have assisteSenator Daschle with those responsibilities.	N
While this differs from direct management experience of a large agency, if confirmeI will work closely with agency officials who manage the day-to-day operations of the Commission to refine the management skills I gaineon the Hill in a manner consistent with its operations.	N
The Government Performance anResults Act requires all government departments anagencies to identify measurable performance goals anto report to Congress on their success in achieving those goals.	N
(a) Please discuss what you believe to be the benefits of identifying performance goals anreporting on your progress in achieving those goals.	N
All successful organizations, anpeople for that matter, whether in government or in the private sector, must have a plan with measurable goals in order to maximize effectiveness.	N
The GPRA, which requires a Strategic Plan anAnnual Performance Plans, increases the effectiveness of Federal agencies by forcing them to adopt a structure by which to measure performance goals anto help set budget priorities.	N
These measurable goals permit Congress, anthe agency itself, to evaluate the progress being made towarachieving certain milestones.	N
They also help direct human anfinancial resources to promote the most pressing priorities.	N
Moreover, they can help determine whether certain programs aninitiatives shoulget additional resources, fewer resources, or shoulbe eliminateentirely.	N
(b) What steps shoulCongress consider taking when an agency fails to achieve its performance goals?	N
Shoulthese steps include the elimination, privatization, downsizing or consolidation of departments and/or programs?	N
The appropriate response to agency failures wouldepenupon the size, significance animpact upon the public of those failures, anthe degree to which it was due to factors under the agency's control, or upon external factors.	N
Depending upon these circumstances, Congress is best able to determine the appropriate response baseupon its investigative anoversight powers.	N
While all the above options are available to Congress, the neefor drastic measures can be minimizeif the agency anCongress maintain effective communication so that would-be failures can be caught early anminimizethrough early corrective action.	N
(c) What performance goals do you believe shoulbe applicable to your personal performance, if confirmed?	N
In order to judge whether I fulfill my responsibilities, if confirmeI shoulbe evaluateas to whether I have implementethe law consistent with congressional intent in a balanced, fair animpartial manner, andone so expeditiously anwith thorough attention to the details of every issue that comes before the Commission.	N
My view of managing involves identifying a core set of values ana vision, ancommunicating them clearly to employees.	N
Foremost among these is a dedication to serving the public interest andoing what is right for the country.	N
Setting a high standarfor service in a public office, whether as an FCC commissioner or as a Senate staffer, serves to inspire employees to reach their full potential by making them realize that they are working for a cause much greater than themselves.	N
Supervisors shoulleaby example, both in terms of their work ethic antheir communication of a vision that drives employees towarmeasurable goals.	N
Supervisors shoulmaintain an open door, be frank about both successes anshortcomings of employees' performance, angive regular guidance as to how to improve performance.	N
These frank discussions are best accomplishein a collaborative setting, with incentives anopportunities to rewaroutstanding performance.	N
Most importantly, employees shoulfeel empowereto achieve their highest aspirations, anshoulbe recognizeangiven credit for achievements.	N
The message is always that we are all in this together, as a team, anthat our successes anfailures matter greatly because other people are depending upon us for, our judgment anwork product.	N
I have serveas a Senate staffer for the past 15 years, advancing in positions of increasing responsibility from positions with a personal staff, a committee staff, anwith a leadership staff.	N
In each of these positions, I have workeregularly with congressional committees in both the Senate anthe House.	N
In the Senate, I have workeparticularly closely with the Committee on Commerce, Science anTransportation, the Committee on Finance anthe Committee on Banking, Housing anUrban Affairs.	N
Please explain what you believe to be the proper relationship between yourself, if confirmed, anthe Inspector General of your department/agency.	N
The Inspector General must maintain independence from the Commissioners anall employees of the agency.	N
If confirmed, were I to observe anything which appeareto involve improprieties, I woulconsider it my duty to report that matter to the IG anallow the IG to conduct an autonomous investigation.	N
In addition, I woulreview any recommendations by the IG involving FCC activities anoperations with great seriousness anact upon them to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.	N
I wouloffer my full support ancooperation to the IG's office anurge cooperation throughout the agency as the IG carrieout its responsibilities.	N
I woulnot tolerate any impediments to the IG's efforts to investigate any anall operations of the Commission.	N
17. Please explain how you will work with this Committee another stakeholders to ensure that regulations issueby your department/	N
I believe I currently enjoy an excellent working relationship with the Commerce Committee anits members on both sides of the aisle, and, if confirmed, I woulstrive to buildupon those relationships.	N
As I have stated, I see it as a fundamental priority to ensure that all of my activities comply with the spirit anthe letter of the laws enacteby Congress.	N
If confirmed, I pledge to maintain a regular dialog with members of this committee antheir staff, consistent with the agency's procedural rules.	N
I will seek regular guidance from them concerning how best to implement that statute as envisioneby the committee anby Congress.	N
I fully recognize that Congress sets the UniteStates' communications policy anthe FCC implements it, anwill act accordingly in all of my relations with this Committee.	N
In areas under the department/agency's jurisdiction, what legislative action(s) shoulCongress consider as priorities?	N
I woulnot presume at this time to recommenany specific legislative actions regarding Federal telecommunications policy.	N
The agency remains involvein debating ways to carry out the substantial responsibilities vestein it by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 1 woulnote that the Chairman has proposestrengthening the agency's enforcement authority, anhis proposals have great merit andeserve the careful attention of Congress.	N
Within your area of control, will you pledge to develop animplement a system that allocates discretionary spending baseon national priorities determinein an open fashion on a set of establishecriteria?	N
If confirmed, I will work with the Chairman in order to set appropriate budgetary priorities anprocesses, anwill seek to ensure the Commission has adequate resources to carry out its responsibilities to meet the national priorities establisheby Congress.	N
I have several questions, but I'like to submit them to you for your consideration anresponse.	N
Diyou happen to see the remarks of Chairman Powell, I believe, reportein the media yesterday that perhaps you may have to even see something which was unthinkable just a short time ago, that perhaps parts or all of WorldCom might be acquireby one of the Bell Companies?	N
It seems to me he's saying also that perhaps, in some aspects of telecommunication, because of the requirements for infrastructure anmassive capital infusions, that perhaps it can't all be competitive.	N
Well, as one of, I think, three hardy souls who voteagainst the Telecommunications Act in 1996, I believe, by any measurement, it has not liveup to the promise of the Act when it was passed.	N
Now, maybe some events were out of the control of the sponsors, but the incredibly optimistic statements that were made on the floor of the Senate anin this Committee when that bill was passehave turneout, obviously, not to be true.	N
My opening question to you, ``What's the state of telecommunications industry today,'' is ample evidence that something went wrong.	N
Now, whether it was just confineto the telecommunications industry antheir behavior, or whether it was the bubble, the defiance of rational laws of investment, of unscrupulous--clearly we know there was unscrupulous executives; in fact, maybe even criminal behavior on the part of some of them--anmaybe part of it was over-hyping the potential of things like broadbananhow quickly they woulbecome part of America's everyday life.	N
Now, you anI have playethis game for many years, so I know that it'll be very difficult to get a definitive answer out of you, because you might make Senator Brownback maif you did.	N
The FCC will play a major role--a major role--because we may continue to be gridlocketo a large degree here in the Congress because of--look at the different broadbanbills that have been proposed, which I think is ample evidence of the divergence of views.	N
But here is a sense of urgency ana sense of priority about this issue because of its impact, not only on the economy of the UniteStates, but, frankly, our ability to progress as a Nation because of the potential that the information technologies have in all aspects of American life and, indeed, rural life.	N
So I hope that you will recognize, as one who was heavily involvein the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that it has not liveup to the expectations that were helfor it at the time it was passed.	N
Anif you don't believe me, go back anlook at the statements that were made at the time of its passage.	N
Anevery group was there behinthose closedoors except one group of Americans, anthat was the American citizen, the ones that can't affora lobbyist, to pay millions of dollars to represent them here in Washington.	N
But, more important, in the immediate term, we'better look at that bill, anwhat its consequences were, both intendeanunintended, anwe'better start to think of new aninnovative ways of doing business, both here in the Congress anat the FCC.	N
The reason why I place so much responsibility on the FCC, frankly, is an admission of my pessimism of our ability to act here in Congress, because we have so many competing special interests that gridlock us time after time.	N
Big money anbig-money lobbyists that are here--a bunch of them are here in this room making several hundredollars an hour as we speak.	N
The fact is that we neeto review what has happenesince we passethat bill in 1996 anlearn some lessons from it, because I don't know how we avoirepeating mistakes in the future unless we review what happenein the past.	N
There was no evil or malfeasance, in my view, of the people who were involvein the passage of this bill.	N
AnI'be glato listen to any response you might have, in a general or a specific fashion.	N
We met andiscusseprivately some of these issues, but I just want to raise them here, as well.	N
A couple of items that the Senate is working on a great deal--overall broadbandeployment, ubiquitous broadbandeployment.	N
We're seeing now more bills circulating in the system to try anget more broadbanout there to consumers.	N
Anit's going to be a tough time where you've got capital markets devaluing telecommunications andeployments so heavily.	N
I hope that the FCC will be positively engagein this in trying to get as much broadbanout andeployeas broadly anas diffusely as possible as we wrestle with the issue here, anas the capital markets take their hit on the telecommunications field.	N
I hope you'll take a very aggressive stance on getting it out everywhere, because you'll be in a key spot, if you're confirmed, to be able to do that, even after legislation that's being considerefrom here.	D
We've got a lot of issues that we're starting to take anwork on here on unlicensespectrum, on spectrum management.	N
We neeto back up on spectrum ancome together on a comprehensive plan, a comprehensive view of that finite resource, anpress on it aggressively so that we can have enough in the future deployein the right places so that we can meet all the needs that we're going to have of our citizenry.	N
Any other tools that you couluse in sponsoring anhaving goospectrum-management policy that you envision as a Commissioner?	N
One other issue I wanteto raise with you, it's one I mentioneto you in our meeting we had.	N
And, Mr. Chairman, if you could, I'like unanimous consent to enter in the recora--this is a one-page summary of a study of TV violence anbrainmapping in children.	N
Anwhat it shows is the brain activity that was going on while a chilwatches violent entertainment, anwhat takes place, what parts of the brain get activatewhen this occurs.	N
It's a very interesting study, in that we've got about a thousanstudies--I mean, truly about a thousanbehavior studies, that say that kids below a certain age, if they watch violent entertainment, they become more violent.	N
This, to my knowledge, is the first set of studies where they go in anactually map what's taking place in the brain.	N
I think we're on the same path as on smoking, where, for years, people woulwake up in the morning, anthey habeen smoking, anthey were coughing, anthey didn't feel good, anso they didn't think smoking was probably goofor them, but they didn't know for sure.	N
Anthen we startewatching the trail, watching the studies, ansaw the links between lung cancer another health problems, when we coulactually track the physical activity that was taking place in the body because of smoking.	N
Anthen that really turnethe tide on it anwe saiwe really have got to discourage people from smoking.	N
Here now, we have what I think is the beginnings of the studies of the smoking gun for what's taking place with violent entertainment anits impact on kids.	N
The reason I point it out to you--anI ask that this be placein the record--and, if you would, to look at it.	N
We license it to radios, television, but in this case I'm talking about television, anthen they have to use this, according to the FCC, in the public interest.	N
AnI woullike for you very much to consider looking at these types of studies anasking if, during family hour, when we are trying to encourage, I woulthink, as much as anything, families to watch television together, is it in the public interest to have a certain level of violent entertainment?	N
But we certainly ought to be funding, I woulthink, a lot more studies like this to determine, not just behaviorally now, but the electrochemicals in the brain anthe activities in the neurons that fire--is this in the public interest?	N
Well, this shows, in here in these studies, that when a chilwatches the violent entertainment--	N
in this, I think they actually showethem scenes from ``Rocky IV''--what it stimulates in the brain is the fight-or-flight area of the brain.	N
Anit also stimulates the part of the brain that's for storing of significant information and--like, you know where you were September 11th.	N
It turns out, when a chilwatches violent entertainment, that part of the brain is stimulateanfires anstarts building the patterns there.	N
Anthe reason that this researcher speculates that children become more violent is that the thinking, the reasoning part of the head, isn't as developed, so now, whenever they see a violent situation, their brain doesn't process it well ansay, ``Well, wait.	N
They just say, ``this is a violent situation'' anreact, because the thinking part of the brain isn't as developeto say, ``No, wait.	N
Anwe haa nice visit in our office after being pushearouna little bit on times aneverything else.	N
We have hartime, it seems like, carving out times to visit about some of the very important things.	N
We talkeabout universal service yesterday, anwe agreethat we're going to have to take some kinof an approach there in order to solve that problem.	N
Annow, with the public-safety people who are deploying anready to put a lot of new technology in place, I'm not real sure it wasn't one of the bills that we passethrough here that has as much impact on public safety as anything that we've done.	N
I operate from the premise that if you fina turtle sitting on top of a fencepost, he didn't get there by himself.	N
But there was a lot of us here that understoothat this was a major piece of legislation that we passed.	N
It was truly one that woulbe very, very beneficial to the people that work in emergency services, first responders, anpeople who are in rural areas.	N
I continue to be concerned--a lot of loss of life in Montana is, No. 1, after the call comes in, we can't finthem.	N
But I look forwarin working with you, Mr. Adelstein, anwe neeyou in a chair down there.	N
Analso I woulbe remiss if I didn't mention a letter I just got from Bob Rowe, our goofrienwho is a Public Service Commissioner out in Montana.	N
You anMr. Rowe have worketogether on a lot of issues, anI consider him one of the finest Commissioners that we've hain Montana.	D
Knowing your friendship, though, anhe highly compliments you anis highly supportive of your nomination anlooks forwarto working with you, anso I appreciate that.	D
You can take a--it's an issue that's coming down the track, anit's got such a heaof steam that, you know, no matter what is saior what is done--you know, you can go out ancatch a June-bug--you know, those great big olJune-bugs?	N
Anyou can put it in a jar anset it up on the shelf in the kitchen, anyou look at that thing for 3 or 4 days.	N
Doing 90 miles anhour, anone of those rascals hit you right in the mouth, you can swallow that thing just like that.	N
Senator Burns has made a great deal of money in my State, by the way, over the years anis thankful for North Dakota.	N
There's no reason to rehash why that's the case; but, nonetheless, today I'm pleaseto support a nominee that I think will do an extraordinary job ansomeone the Commission desperately needs at this point.	N
I know you will, but on the issues of universal service, competition, anthe things that really matter to a lot of the American people, we're going to have to rely on you to be a voice that's extraordinarily aggressive, annever give up on these issues.	N
Do you agree that, in recent years, actions have been taken by the FCC that have narrowethe base for support of universal service, anthat, in fact, if we're going to have a robust universal-service support of advanceservices, you have to have a broader base, not a narrower base?	N
I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but my point is, yes, a court ruled, but the ruling wasn't even appealed.	N
Well, Mr. Adelstein, it will be a breath of fresh air to have you serve on the Commission.	N
We've haa lot of wonderful people in this country's history serve in that role, but we have a Commission that is relatively inexperienced, as you know, anI'm not going to talk about any particular member of the Commission at this point, but a relatively inexperienceCommission analso a Commission that seems less aggressive in pursuing the things that we wrote in the law.	N
Anthat was to say that universal service support shall apply to ``advancetelecommunications services.''	N
It is going to be a breath of fresh air to have you there, anI wish you well anhave high hopes for your service at the FCC anam pleaseto vote for your nomination.	N
I'm certain you know that the Members of this Committee seem rather pleasewith your nomination.	N
This afternoon, the Committee was to hear two nominations, that of Major General Charles Bolden to be the Deputy Administrator anMr. Robert Cobb to be the Inspector General of NASA.	N
Instead, we will hear Mr. Cobb's nomination, as General Bolden has withdrawn his name from nomination in order to continue his military service at this time of war.	D
General Bolden is the Commanding General of the ThirMarine Aircraft Wing in San Diego, California.	D
Before we begin hearing from Mr. Cobb, I will say that I believe that General Bolden woulbe an excellent nominee for NASA's Deputy Administrator.	D
In 1980, he was selectefor an astronaut candidate for NASA, anqualifieas a Space Shuttle pilot astronaut in 1981.	D
Another member of that crew is a distinguishemember of our Full Committee ana member of the Subcommittee I chair, Senator Bill Nelson.	N
He also knew the job of Deputy Administrator, having serveas the Assistant Deputy Administrator from 1992 to 1994.	D
I am certain that his service to NASA woulhave been as valuable as it continues to be in the UniteStates Marine Corps.	D
Let me also State that I think it is very understandable that the President of the UniteStates wants to have all hands on deck in this fight against terrorism, anhe has my support, as he has the support of all Americans.	N
At the same time, I think it is critical that NASA also have all hands on deck, anI am very hopeful that the administration will move quickly to fill the position of nominee for NASA's Deputy Administrator.	N
Mr. O'Keefe, for example, has looketo a number of changes in technology policy that I think warrant thoughtful analysis, anwe have learnejust in the last few days that NASA has not yet endeits financial woes.	D
Its independent auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, has declineto issue an opinion on the agency's fiscal year 2001 financial statement, essentially declaring that NASA is not an agency that you can audit.	D
Now, like millions of Americans, I share the hopes andreams of the agency for great gains anachievements in space, but there are not going to be a lot of dreams, there are not going to be a lot of gains if, in fact, you have got an agency that auditors claim is in such financial chaos that you cannot audit it, so we have got a problem here that of course is not the first time we have hearabout this.	N
The General Accounting Office has citebefore NASA's inability to provide documentation it needeto independently verify obligations anexpenses, so it is critical that the administration move to fill the slot that Mr. Bolden woulhave assumehahe been confirmed.	N
We are going to work with them, as we always do in this Committee, in a bipartisan way, but with NASA chargeto undertake civilian research andevelopment involving flight activity anaeronautics anspace at a critical time with a budget of nearly $15 billion, it is important that in addition to having all hands on deck in this fight against terrorism, that we have all hands on deck with respect to the programs that are under NASA's jurisdiction.	N
To further underscore the importance of this work, I woullike to announce today that after we have haa chance to consult with Senator Allen anSenator McCain on the Minority side and, of course, Chairman Hollings, who has been so supportive of these programs anthis work, over the next 2 months we are going to have an oversight hearing to examine some of the activities that are taking place at the agency.	N
I think this is a timely run-up to the reauthorization of the program, which expires later this year, so there are considerable questions that warrant the scrutiny of both the Full Committee anthe Subcommittee I chair, anwe are going to examine them.	N
Of course these financial flaws in particular stem from NASA's lack of a modern, integratefinancial management system.	N
While NASA officials agree that there is a problem anhave promisethe new financial system will provide the necessary documentation, we do have to note that this is NASA's thirattempt since 1988 to integrate its financial systems.	N
The first two attempts were abandoneafter 12 years, anspending a reporte$180 million, anMr. Cobb, whose nomination we will consider today, is going to have an important role in straightening out those systems once anfor all, anit is vital that the agency does so.	N
The agency's financial problems threaten its future, threaten the great tradition of research andevelopment that produces technologies that will drive our economy.	N
I look forwarto working with Mr. Cobb anwith Administrator O'Keefe on many of the issues facing the agency.	N
During Mr. O'Keefe's confirmation hearing before the Committee, I challengehim to return NASA to a science anresearch-	N
driven agenda so that our dedicatescientists anengineers can finthe breakthrough technologies that have been NASA at its best.	N
To follow through on that vision, it will be critical that the Inspector General be a watch-dog, ensuring that the agency's financial problems do not recur under Administrator O'Keefe's watch.	N
A few weeks ago, the beginning of March, PriceWaterhouseCoopers puts out their independent audit of the agency for fiscal year 2001, anbasically their conclusion is that you cannot audit the place, that things are so out of control with respect to a lack of financial documentation for some of the agency's transactions that they basically are saying it is not auditable.	N
Given the fact that you are getting started, anthis is just to get a sense of how you are going to proceed, how are you going to go drain the swamp?	N
How are you going to get after it the day you get confirmed, given that this is an embarrassment, to use your words?	N
Now, the Act, the Inspector General Act spells out essentially the duties of the Inspector General, anobviously there are legitimate questions in terms of allocating your time, but clearly part of those duties include conducting ansupervising independent anobjective audits aninvestigations relating to agency programs anoperations.	N
You have already saito me anelsewhere you are not an accountant, but clearly there is going to be a neefor a tireless fiscal watch-dog to get the agency in financial shape anensure that it stays in shape.	N
Now, is that going to be the sole focus of what you do to try to get the place in financial shape, or are there other steps that you think are warranteright now?	N
Let us talk for a minute about the integratefinancial management concept, how this is NASA's thirattempt since 1988 to put this together.	N
The first two attempts, 12 years time, reporte$180 million, the agency expects to complete the current system effort by 2007 at a cost of $645 million.	N
Can you tell us what you wouldo, as Inspector General, to help enthis marathon exercise anactually achieve a useful, integratefinancial system?	N
He anI work in a very bipartisan way on all of these issues, anI appreciate all of his involvement.	N
My inclination, I think, is I will ask these questions quickly, anthen just turn it over to you for both a statement anany questions.	N
With respect to computer security, the former Inspector General was recognizeas an individual who haa great interest in computer frauancomputer security.	D
You have got some very gooforensic analysts who have been critical in developing cases against hackers who have attackesystems at NASA another Government agencies.	N
How are you going to approach computer security questions, anin particular make sure that the expertise that has been developeat the agency is continued?	N
I think when you look at the history of the agency anthe debate about the agency anits priorities, one of the things that you always hear, it is a recurring kinof theme, is that any time you go after expenditures, anparticularly areas where there is documentewaste aninefficiency, somebody says, ``Well, you are going to hurt safety, this is going to be bafor safety.''	N
As I saiat Mr. O'Keefe's confirmation hearing, in my view cutting fat does not mean cutting corners on safety, anI have just got to believe that NASA has got the talent to come up with new ways of doing things, new ways of making the agency more efficient, that are also safe ways of doing them.	N
One of the things that was striking is, you have haa great interest over the years in risk management, aninnovation.	D
How do you approach this question of trying to strike the balance where you come up with new ways of approaching issues ansolving problems while at the same time not compromising the safety that all of us care about for the patriots who serve our country?	N
I was meeting on another technology subject, anI was listening to the questions you were asking.	N
I want to make a brief opening comment about this position anNASA generally anget some of your views on it, Mr. Cobb.	N
Folks of South Carolina must have been very forgiving if you hasomeone who servein the Maine infantry during the War between the States anelectefamily members in all sorts of positions, anso you certainly have bloodlines who have serveremarkably throughout the history of our country, not just then, but subsequent as well.	N
In this hearing I think it is important for us not to look at the past, but to look at the future, anthe future of our country will be in large part due to our advancements anleadership in the area of technology, anparticularly where NASA is involved, the first day of aeronautics, much of what you woulbe doing is looking at the efficiency ancutting back on waste anso forth, anthat is a very important principle.	N
We neeto be looking for scientific excellence, anyou will get more excellence as you have more money actually being utilizefor something productive anuseful, annew developments, new technologies, whether it is civilian or military.	N
We have hahearings previously with Mr. O'Keefe anlast year as well on the fine, outstanding people who work at NASA.	N
The greatest resource of NASA is the people, anwe neeto make sure that we keep that in aeronautics anin space, ankeep that fiscal responsibility with the taxpayer's dollars.	N
Now, as far as aeronautics, I think it is absolutely essential, even after September 11, for us to make sure that we do keep our lead, but we haa hearing last year when I was actually chairman of the Subcommittee, before Mr. Jeffords went to the other side.	N
At any rate, it was on the issue of aeronautics research, anthere was a lot of concern about our technological edge in aeronautics being challenged, for example, by the Europeans, anthe aviation industry, if you look at the importance of the aviation industry to our country, it is a net exporter.	N
It is one of our best exporting aspects for balance of trade, anobviously our preeminence is important for good-paying jobs in our country.	N
Now, NASA's aerospace technology enterprise anthe Langley Research Center, they are engagein developing innovative technologies, many of which have been adopted, anthey are beneficial for the aviation industry, antheir research is not just revolutionary, it is also evolutionary in the way that they look at it, anwhether that is for advancewarning of winshear, or designing advancetraffic management systems, which I know the chairman anI both share a great concern about, anthat is exactly one of the things that are needed.	N
I am glaReagan National is finally getting fully operational, but there are technologies that can help us with our security, anNASA is involvein some of that research, as well as developing what are callemorphing wing vehicles for future aviation use.	N
It will reduce accidents anfatalities, obviously, anI look forwarto working with you as Inspector General to ensure that the aeronautics program is run efficiently to maximize the return of the taxpayer's investment.	N
Now, to the extent you get in, anI know you are answering questions, anI saw your comments as far as the Space Station, there is a concern that all the cost overruns at the Space Station are, of course, eating away, or taking away from other very important missions of NASA in the aeronautics another space endeavors in research, anso what you do, making those very important decisions anrecommendations to us anto the administration as to what is worthwhile, what is going to get us the most use for our dollars, or where there coulbe improvements woulbe very closely listeneto anI think will be very important.	N
I woulbe interestein hearing how you woulsuggest that NASA address the issues regarding human capital, if you could, because one thing that also came up out of those hearings last year on aeronautics is that the age of the people who are working in NASA, many of the engineers anscientists are--they are not right next to retirement, but they are generally older, annot that far from retirement, anwhen you lose that sort of capacity, when you understanthat the human capital is the greatest asset of NASA, anthat experience anknowledge ancapability, how are we going to be able to attract more--	N
obviously, I woulthink you woulneeto work with the colleges anthe universities, also in the private sector, to attract people into that research, seeing a worthwhile endeavor, or a fulfillment of a life work analso as a career for an individual.	N
I woulhope that you woulhave some ideas as to how we can work to attract the best to be those innovators for the future, which is goofor our country, goofor our quality of life, goofor our security, anclearly also vital for our economy as well.	N
Well, I woulsay, Mr. Chairman, I have reathrough Mr. Cobb's qualifications, more than just his genealogy, anI finthis gentleman to be more than qualified, in fact highly qualified.	D
I think you are going to have probably one of the tougher jobs, but also the most important job.	N
You have the qualifications, you have the background, you have the learning, anthe experience, but in your answer in the midst of it, while just trying to determine what are your principles, I think you most importantly have an understanding of how important it is that NASA be run as properly as possible.	D
That is just the nature of scientific research andevelopment matters, but I do think that the public's confidence anthe credibility of NASA is important as we make decisions, analso I think you respect the role that the electepeople have, those of us in the Senate, in making decisions baseon information, that I think that the information we receive from you will be credible.	N
It will not be gilded, it will be straightforward, anI look forwarto working with you, Mr. Cobb, anthank you for your continuing service to your country.	D
I thank my colleague, anhe makes a number of points that I agree with, anin fact I think the only other question I have woulreally pick up on an area you toucheon, anthat is really the sort of evaluative process.	N
I mean, you are going to be there, anyou are going to be trying to conduct some of these evaluations anassessments in areas that do not lenthemselves to kinof cookie-cutter kinds of approaches, anI woulbe curious, just by way of how you think through these issues, what kinof evaluative processes do you think woulbe appropriate for areas like R&D?	N
I mean, that is an area that both of us are strongly supportive of, anwe are going to support investments in this area anhave already in many areas of science antechnology policy, anat the same time we have got to explain to the people of Virginia anthe people of Oregon who are putting their money out, what they are getting for it.	N
Tell me, if you would, how you might go about getting your arms arounevaluating R&D expenditures.	N
The two of us are going to continue the bipartisan tradition ansupport you, anwe are going to work to get you confirmed, anI think you will speak very well for our Government, anyour work, as Senator Allen noted, is especially important right now, so Godspeed.	D
Mr. Chairman, I am honoreto be here today to support someone for whom I have a tremendous respect.	N
I have workeclosely with the nominee for many, many years, particularly when he was over working for BuSchuster, anI have to tell you, I have the highest regarfor him.	D
Last week, I sent a letter to the Committee urging the Committee to confirm Roger Nober as a member of the Surface Transportation Board, anI am very honoreto be here with my colleague, who has a very deep interest in surface transportation issues, anI am just thrilled, frankly, that he will be nameChairman of that Commission by the President	N
But in the transportation field, there is an olsaying that there are no Republican bridges, there are no Democratic roads, or vice versa, anI think Roger is really proof of that.	N
Roger haa great working relationship, it coulnot have been better, in working with my office anmy staff along with Senator Warner anCongressman Tom Petri anothers who are interestein surface transportation issues.	D
He has been a kindrespirit anis an outspoken defender of the Highway Trust Funana proponent of the importance of transportation in general.	D
We have a transportation situation that is similar to many other problems of many other states, anthat is with respect to our grain growers anshippers who are having a tough time making ends meet anworking out goodeals with the railroads to get their products to market.	N
Senator Burns, my colleague ana Member of this Committee, anI introducea bill to try to deal with these problems.	N
I know Roger is fairly sympathetic, anso I will not take any more of the Committee's time.	N
I commenthe President for his well-thought-out selection and, Mr. Chairman, it is with the highest regarthat I support, along with my colleagues, anintroduce to this Committee Roger Nober, because he is, I think, going to be a great credit, frankly, to this Nation.	N
Thank you very much, Senator Baucus and, of course, I thank our colleagues, who woulbe excuseif they so desire, after they make their comments.	N
That was a beautiful introduction, given by my long-time frienanfellow colleague in the worlof transportation another things, Max Baucus.	N
Out of deference to you, I am not going to reamy preparestatement, because I coulnot do any better, or make it any more heartfelt.	N
This is an incredible individual here, because I at that time was Chairman of this Subcommittee on our Committee, anSenator Baucus, Senator Chafee anI, the three of us workeas a team with your former Chairman, anyou, my goofriend, anwe put together one of the most historic pieces of legislation that I have been privilegeto work on in my 24 years in the Senate.	D
I think at this point maybe we ought to ask Roger to introduce his lovely family, who are right behinhim.	N
I appreciate your holding this hearing because I woullike to see DaviLaney get through the Senate before the recess.	N
It seems like every week we wake up to a new one, anI cannot think of anyone more qualifieto sit on the Amtrak Boarthan DaviLaney.	N
Davigraduatefrom StanforUniversity anreceivehis law degree from SMU, Southern Methodist University.	N
In Dallas, he has been a managing partner of Jenkins anGilchrist, a very prestigious national law firm, anfor 12 years he also serveas a gubernatorial appointee in Texas.	D
He was appointeto the Texas Finance Commission anlater to the Texas Transportation Commission.	D
As Chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission, he functionebasically as the CEO of the Texas Department of Transportation.	N
That is a major state agency in Texas, with 14,000 employees ana $5 billion annual budget.	N
As you might know, coming from Louisiana, we have great highways in Texas anwe have more of them than any other state in America, so this really has given DaviLaney a lot of experience in managing a big agency.	N
Now, that is not to say he is going to replace the CEO, but certainly the CEO needs a lot of help from the Boaranfrom experiencebusiness people.	D
I am a supporter of Amtrak anI have workewith Members of this Committee to support Amtrak, but we cannot keep putting Band-Aids on Amtrak.	N
We neeto recognize that Amtrak is a national passenger rail system that serves a vital function as one of our types of intermodal transportation.	N
I hope that we will be able, through goopeople like DaviGunn anlike DaviLaney, to save Amtrak anput it on a course where it can succeed, grow, anattract the passengers that it woulif it were on a solifinancial footing.	D
I think the important thing is looking for ways to assure solifinancial footing in order to make it a strong national system.	N
You know, after 9/11, a lot of people took Amtrak, anthey were looking for alternative modes of transportation to air.	N
I think now that almost a year has passed, we know that rail shoulbe a permanent part of our intermodal transportation system in America, anI cannot think of anyone more qualifieto be helpful in that regarthan DaviLaney.	N
Thank you very much, Senator Hutchison, for your participation anassistance in these very important areas.	N
Before we hear from our two nominees angive them a chance to make an opening statement anintroduce their families or associates that are with them, I woullike to recognize any of our Committee Members for any comments they may have.	N
We have, since last September, haan opening on the Democratic seat on the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC.	N
I say to those who holthese things up that we neethat rural voice on the Federal Communications Commission, anwe neeit now, but I am not going to holup other nominations because of it.	N
But I say to my colleagues who do holup these nominations, we neethat person on the FCC right now.	N
Mr. Chairman, I hope you will agree with me that--anthis is not anything we have been involvein--we neeto finour colleagues on the Senate who are holding these up, ansay to them that we are not going to holyour nominations up; anwe do not expect you to holours up.	N
Now, having saiall that, Mr. Laney, the Amtrak issue is a very important issue to me anto many Members of the U.S. Senate, anI am a strong believer in having a national rail passenger system.	N
The two of you woulbe on the board, as I understanit, so I am pleaseto support your nomination.	N
I know the Chairman will ask you to introduce them more formally, but it is nice to see your family with you as well.	N
I appreciate your scheduling this in a timely way, anjust a few comments for each of our nominees, because I, too, am only going to be able to be here briefly.	N
Let me also say, I have only hearpositive things about both of you individuals, ancertainly it is my intent to support both of you, but let me just share briefly with you several concerns I have.	N
I think your questions were excellent, Mr. Chairman, anhighlightea number of important issues.	N
Well, I woulurge you, anI will make sure you have a copy, to look at it, because it is really scathing in terms of its criticism of how Amtrak goes about making decisions.	N
They saiwith respect to the network growth strategy that Amtrak was proceeding in a speculative way.	N
They saiagain, anI will quote, ``Amtrak dinot obtain a full understanding of freight railroaconcerns.''	N
I woullike to begin by seeing if you agree with my judgment that it is time for a shift in Amtrak policy so that decisions are baseon objective criteria.	N
We can have a debate about what those objective criteria ought to be, anI think that is an appropriate thing to discuss, but I want us to go there as a public policy goal, to set out objective criteria.	N
I think that is fair, anI am going to interpret that as a yes, with exactly the kinof qualification that is appropriate.	N
I think that is a very reasonable orientation, ansomething on which we ought to have a debate.	N
What I am concerneabout is the politicizing of these routes, as we have seen again anagain.	N
We have communities in rural Oregon that have done everything except holbake sales in order to funAmtrak service.	N
They have agreed, for example, to levy per capita assessments on their constituents, so they understanthat this is not the transportation policy of yesteryear where we are just going to heave money every which way anhope some of it works.	N
In the Amtrak markup that we considereearlier in the year, I sponsorean amendment to require that Amtrak's Boarof Directors antop management comply with the same ethical standards as federal officials anemployees.	N
My concern has been that there has been a double standard, anparticularly at Amtrak, a kinof revolving door which favors the East Coast of the UniteStates, frankly, where people go back anforth on various parts of the East Coast of the UniteStates, anit certainly gives the appearance, at a minimum, of having a bias in favor of those East Coast routes.	N
It stands ready to come before the Senate floor, anI woulbe interestein your position as to whether the same sort of ethical standards that are requireof federal officials anemployees ought to apply in the positions at Amtrak.	N
I was concerneparticularly that the heaof Amtrak essentially spent all of his time in New Jersey, then went to the regional office, then went to the heaof Amtrak, annow is back in New Jersey.	N
He certainly at the time was making decisions that involverouting as it relateto the East Coast of the UniteStates.	N
As a result of that, I dia review of the statutes in this area, anI founthat there were not the same ethical requirements for officials on these Amtrak positions as there were for other federal officials.	N
So on a unanimous basis this Committee agreeto the amendment that I have just describethis afternoon, anthat is something I feel strongly about.	N
It is only fair that you have a chance to reait, but I woulbe interestein knowing as a general principle whether you think the same ethical strictures that apply to federal officials generally shoulapply in positions like the one in which you are being considered.	N
By getting unanimous support for the amendment in the Committee, I made it clear that I am not accusing anybody of any crimes or anything of the sort.	N
I have no quarrel with the proposition that there is a lot of expertise in the Northeast part of the UniteStates.	N
But when these routes are being made, people are negotiating about aspects of routing that can affect their future employment, certainly it gives the appearance of impropriety.	N
I think Senator Breaux coverevery well the question of competition among railroads, anI thought your answers were helpful there.	N
On the question of Class I carriers, anthis touches particularly on the short line railroaissue, what are your thoughts regarding the appropriateness of Class I carriers determining what the route of a short line carrier can offer the customers through the methods that I essentially describein my opening statement?	N
The other question I hais, the small volume shippers are generally exasperateabout the process.	N
They look at the existing rate complaint process ansay, it is complicateanalmost too uncertain to be of any real value.	N
I gather that nobody has ever even filea case, not one, under the STB small rate case guidelines.	N
I woulbe interestein knowing whether you share some of these concerns, anwhat you think you might be able to do to alleviate the concern of the small shipper as it relates to resolving rail disputes.	N
Again, like the ethical discussion I was having with Mr. Laney, I was pretty amazethat nobody haever filea case under the STB small rate case area because it seemeso complicated.	N
Today the Committee considers the nomination of Dr. John Marburger for Director of the Office of Science anTechnology Policy anto serve as the President's Science Advisor, anthe nomination of Mr. Phillip Bonto be the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.	N
We will give these two distinguisheindividuals a more formal introduction in just a few moments, anwe are also pleaseto have a number of our colleagues from the House, particularly my olfrienChairman SherwooBoehlert here with us today, anSherry, we are very pleasethat you are here as well.	D
Since the attacks of September 11, the role of science antechnology has become even more important than ever before.	N
Just yesterday, some news organizations were reporting that anthrax from American labs was sent to Iraq in the 1980's as part of a scientific effort.	N
While the report dinot mention Government involvement in this effort, the inherent risk of such action is unmistakable.	N
I am of the view that it is important that intellectual security be seen as an integral part of any national security approach.	N
Given the possibilities for the misuse of science, I also see tremendous potential in harnessing science antechnology in a protective effort, from developing the technology to direct airplanes from a control tower insteaof a cockpit, to using science to quickly develop antidotes anvaccines to potential bioterrorism agents, taxpayer money can be smartly investein advances that ultimately rewaranbenefit the safety anpeace of minof all Americans.	N
We intento look very closely at what happeneon September 11 with a mintowarmaking sure the preventive steps are in place so as to do everything possible to eliminate the prospect of such tragedies again, analso to take those steps to try to repair anrecreate a damagetechnology infrastructure.	N
I proposein recent days what I have callethe technology equivalent of the National Guard, made up of the brains antalent in this country's leading technology companies, that have indicateto me another Members of Congress that they woulbe happy on essentially a volunteer basis to step in antry to both prevent such tragedies anto repair anrecreate damagecommunication systems.	N
Suffice it to say that while these companies made Herculean efforts after September 11 to help, sending people anequipment anresources to New York City, it is now quite clear that there are many significant gaps in the way these matters are handled.	N
For example, yesterday, in meetings that I helat home in Portland, Oregon, I was adviseby many of the leaders in our technology companies that they anothers hatrieto donate people anequipment in New York City to try to responto the problems, anNew York City just was not set up to handle it.	N
I came away with a feeling that if nothing else was done in this country but to set up a clearinghouse where you coulreadily get the information about the brains anthe equipment anthe companies anthe people who coulassist in the event of such tragedies, that that alone woulbe a very valuable contribution.	N
This Subcommittee intends to holhearings on the situation in New York City in terms of the response on the technology side very soon, perhaps as soon as next week, anwe are looking forwarto exploring a variety of the proposals that have been made with respect to both the private anthe public sector.	N
While we work to coordinate with the private sector to responto threats, coordination in the public sector is also requireto prevent terrorist threats from becoming a reality.	N
The General Accounting Office recently releasea troubling new report entitled, ``Combatting Terrorism''.	N
One of the sections of the General Accounting Office report dealt with a lack of coordination among science agencies in conducting counterterrorism research.	N
For example, it founthat the Coast Guarwas conducting research on detection of chemical attacks on cruise ships, anwas unaware of similar research being conducteby the Defense Department.	N
The General Accounting Office recommendedevelopment of a strategic plan for research andevelopment on the counterterr-	N
orism front that woulprevent duplication anleverage our resources, anso we intento ask you, Dr. Marburger, about how you woulparticipate in the development anexecution of such a plan.	N
Obviously, to put such a plan together, it will have to be closely coordinatewith new Office of HomelanSecurity.	N
Sherry Boehlert, Tom Ridge anI teameup quite often over the years on these kinds of issues involving science antechnology policy, anI think he is going to do a superb job in that position, but one of the keys to his success will be to coordinate the 40 or so agencies involvein antiterrorist activity, anone of the things we intenon this Subcommittee to look at is the possibility of convening a meeting among the technology officers of the pertinent intelligence divisions, Tom Ridge's Office of HomelanSecurity ancongressional leaders to look at ways for technology to assist in coordinating ansharing intelligence in a safe ansecure way, andetermine how the Congress can be most helpful to the administration in achieving that outcome.	N
Finally, one last area that I have haa special interest in over the years is to ensure that science policy anscience antechnology issues are addresseso as to promote sounscience, real science as apart from junk science, anone of the things that we intento do is to try to look ansee whether it may be possible to define a set of core principles that woulbe useto try to best identify what constitutes sounscience.	N
There are obviously some ideas that already come to mind, such as ensuring, for example, that there is thorough peer review of scientific judgments.	N
Dr. Marburger, I intento explore with you, as well, some of your ideas about how, at a time when science is more important than ever before, we can see if we can come up with some principles that will help to guide us ankeep us away from junk science that is dictateperhaps more by parochial or boardroom decisions than real scientific merit.	N
We are anxious to hear from our colleagues in the House, but first I am very pleasethat Senator Brownback is here.	N
He has haa great interest in these issues over the years as well, anwe woulbe happy to hear from you.	D
I appreciate the comments, anappreciate that you are doing this anputting this hearing in front of the rest of the Senate.	N
We are considering two of the President's nominations, anvery important I consider science antechnology positions, Phillip Bonto be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, anJohn Marburger to be Director of the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
Both Mr. BonanMr. Marburger are clearly qualifieto fulfill the responsibilities of these positions, anI look forwarto getting them into office just as soon as possible.	D
Certainly, with everything that has transpiresince September 11, I think it is safe to say that the importance of these positions will be underscoreas Congress seeks to address matters of an urgent nature ansquare away the budget.	N
Working in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission anthe National Telecommunications anInformation Administration, both of these positions will play an important role in certain areas where Congress is perhaps not as disposeto act, for obvious reasons, anI say that in reference to the telecommunications industry we have hasome difficulties in deploying certain technologies in telcom.	N
It is bafor consumers, anit is bafor the economy, anwe are going to neeto right that ship, anyou are going to be in positions to help influence that policy creation animplementation.	N
In my view, the state of the industry today indicates that the creation of a national broadbanpolicy is important anlong overdue.	N
As we in Congress continue to address the budget, anthe immediate priorities associatewith the war on terrorism, I urge you gentlemen to engage your colleagues in Government anto seek to create a broader national dialog on spurring technology, technology development--particularly the broadbandeployment that I think can be a very important part of our technology growth anour communication--anour infrastructure for security in this country.	N
I do not anticipate there will be any problem in getting you cleareon through aninto these positions.	N
It is important that you get there anyou get there soon to engage the battle front, anI welcome you here.	N
I just want to say to my olfrienSherry Boehlert that I am delighteto see him, anyou have got such an important position now in the House as Chairman of the Science Committee.	D
I am glayou are here on behalf of these gentlemen, anjust by way of introduction I woulsay that OSTP is one of the most important appointments in the Federal Government.	N
For example, one thing that you woulhave some influence over is the conundrum that is now faceby NASA, where the Chairman has a hearing on this in all of the cost overruns on the space station, the starvation diet that NASA is being put on, actually delaying or canceling the safety upgrades for the space shuttle, anhis hearing on this was the first week of September.	N
Well, now after September 11, we do not have a choice, because we have to have assureaccess to space, anyour risk factor for catastrophic failure on something like the Titan is 1 in 20.	N
Your only assureaccess to space then woulbe the shuttle, until they coulget the EELV's, but none of them have been flown, so the assureaccess to space now takes a whole new importance, ana dimension, anOSTP is clearly in a position to influence that.	N
Now, I have spoken directly with Chairman Boehlert anmy olfriend, now the Vice President, about this, but he needs, anothers in the administration--anthis is just one thing we are talking about, Mr. Bond.	N
In the area of space commercialization, you know, there was at one point this rush to say that people were going to put platforms at sea, right on the equator, anwe were going to launch so we dinot have to pay the fuel penalty.	N
Well now, look at the vulnerability of those platforms to terrorist activity, when you have to have assureaccess to space with regarto commercial ventures, which now become so important to us from the standpoint of national aninternational security.	N
So there again, you have a very important position with regarto making sure that all of this commercial activity of getting to space does not leave the UniteStates.	N
So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me join in angiving my 2 cents, anto say also hello to Chairman Boehlert.	N
Thank you, Senator Nelson, anobviously we are very pleaseyou are on this Subcommittee as a passionate advocate for these space issues, anyou raise the critical concerns for the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
I am going to offer a brief introduction anthen turn it over to Senator Allen, who, like myself, has a special relationship with Phil Bond, anthen we are going to turn it over to our colleagues from the House as well.	N
Dr. Marburger is a physicist by training anhas haa long andistinguishecareer in science, most recently as Director of the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory.	D
Dr. Marburger came anmet with me early on, anwe expect him to play a major role in the Office of Science anTechnology Policy with the President's Council of Advisors on Science anTechnology, known as PCAST, anwith the council's president, FloyKvamme, who I respect very much, anso we welcome you as well.	N
We also have Mr. Phillip Bond, who is nominateto be the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.	N
He is joinetoday by his wife, Dianne, anhis daughters Jacqueline anJessica, anhopefully we can get the Bondelegation to stand.	N
Welcome, anMr. Bonis a distinguishegraduate of LinfielCollege, in my home State of Oregon.	D
Northwest members of the congressional delegation I think have been tripping over themselves to introduce Phil Bond.	N
We are going to make her statement of support a part of the hearing recorin its entirety, anwe expect Phil Bonto play a major role on technology questions, be it Internet taxes, some of the issues we are going to be looking at with respect to responding to what happenein New York City, anwe sort of consider Phil Bonan honorary Oregonian, anwe are very glayou are here.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you for having this very important nominations hearing today.	N
The Department of Commerce, technology anparticularly the administration thereof, is obviously very important for our scientific antechnological advancements, anthat analysis is vitally needein our Federal Government, not just for the Government but for our economy, anwe have two very highly qualifieindividuals, capable individuals today, seeking our confirmation, which I am sure they will receive, anI do want to welcome Dr. Marburger.	D
Phil Bonis the President's nominee for the post of Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.	N
I know Secretary Evans is very interestein our competitiveness as a country, anI fintechnology--anI know the Chairman shares my view--I fintechnology to be a key for success as a Nation, anPhil Bonhas the capabilities, the background, anexperience to give gooadvice to the White House as well as to us in the House anthe Senate.	D
That is where I was dropped, anthen we movearounthe country, but never through Oregon.	N
I was educated, my higher education was in Virginia, but Phil Bonalso for the last 15 years has residein the Commonwealth of Virginia with his wonderful wife Dianne, anI suspect that Jacqueline anJessica were born in Virginia, is that correct?	N
Mr. Bonserveseveral times on Capitol Hill, serving as chief of staff for both Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn of Washington, anCongressman Rob McKuen of Oregon.	D
He servealso in the Department of Defense in the Reagan administration anin the first Bush administration.	D
In the latter case, Mr. Bonserveas a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs with then-	D
Phil's work in the public sector is well-known, also the private sector, having workefor Hewlett-Packard, the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents all of the leaders in the technology community, anthat is important, anmakes him an ideal choice to be the President's principal voice on domestic aninternational technology issues.	D
He will also oversee the Office of Technology Policy, the National Institute of Standards anTechnology, otherwise referreto as NIST, the National Technical Information Service, anthe Office of Space Commercialization, which I know our colleague Senator Nelson of Florida has a great deal of knowledge aninterest in.	D
This position, Phil, as you well know, is going to take extensive coordination between the Government or public sector, as well as the private sector.	D
I know that you will bring your many years of private experience, your knowledge beyonyour years, because you are still young, but nevertheless you have that energy, you have that knowledge, you have the experience, anthank you for coming back to service for your country and, indeed, for our economy anour quality of life in this country.	D
So Mr. Chairman, it is my great pleasure to present Mr. Phil Bonto this Committee for favorable consideration, anI thank Mr. Bonfor his service.	D
You made it clear with respect to aviation technology that there are a number of areas where this Subcommittee coulteam up with the administration, anwe are going to do that, anwe appreciate that.	N
All right, let us wrap up our introductions by having the distinguishechairman of the Science Committee, Mr. Boehlert anMr. Grucci, make their comments.	N
Sherry, thank you for an excellent presentation, anDr. Marburger is lucky to have a passionate advocate like you, anwe will continue, as you know, to work closely with you.	N
Gentlemen, I think we are at the point where you finally get to say your piece, anI am sure you are anxious to do it.	N
We will begin with you, Dr. Marburger, anmy inclination is that we will have Dr. Marburger first, anthen Mr. Bonnext, anthen we will start in with questions for both of them after the presentations.	N
Thank you, Mr. Bond, anwe will just go with each Senator taking 10 minutes or so on the first round, anthen I expect we will have several rounds this afternoon because of the importance of these issues.	N
Dr. Marburger, I think you hearme say in my opening statement that I founvery troubling that section of the General Accounting Office report recently that dealt with the lack of coordination among science agencies in conducting counterterrorism research.	N
Specifically what they saiwas that the Coast Guarwas conducting research on detection of chemical attacks on cruise ships, anthe Coast Guardinot know of virtually identical research being conducteby the Defense Department.	N
I think it is very clear that one of the keys for you anfor Tom Ridge in the days aheais to make sure that the left hananthe right hanare having a conversation, because it is integral that this research be done.	N
I cannot conceive that a Member of the U.S. Senate woulnot support this research, but it is going to undermine our ability to get this work done if the General Accounting Office comes back 2 years hence ansays, ``Well, as a result of the September 11 tragedy, there was an effort to beef up the Government's work with respect to chemical attacks on these defense installations, but again two agencies were heading off without making any efforts to coordinate''.	N
What do you see your role specifically being to prevent this kinof duplication that the General Accounting Office talkeabout in the new report?	N
In a situation like this, woulit not make sense, before everybody goes off andoes their own research, to essentially have a policy where the administration in concert with the Congress says, ``This is an area we want to fund, anthese are the people we want to have do it'', anwe not just sort of get involveafter the fact?	N
What has troubleme is that it seems like we are always playing catch-up ball in trying to eliminate duplication anthe lack of coordination, anso the General Accounting Office comes out anoffers this report, anit is troubling Senator Allen anmyself anMembers of Congress, anhere you are, you are just coming in.	N
This dinot happen on your watch, anwe ask you a question, anyou say, ``By God, Senators Wyden anAllen, we are going to go out ando better coordination''.	N
I think what I woullike to see on your watch is essentially an approach that woulbe preventive in nature, anthat you, in concert with Mr. Ridge anthe relevant officials, work with Senator Allen anmyself another Members of the Senate ansay, ``This is what we think needs to be done, anyou Members of the U.S. Senate, you have got to just walk the walk in addition to talking the talk angive us the money'', but once we do, then we can holaccountable the people who are chargewith the responsibility, anwe do not just keep repeating these instances where the research it is done, it is duplicative, the General Accounting Office issues a critical report, anthen you have got to come in here anhave a bunch of Members of the Senate carp at you.	N
The previous administration--President Clinton wrote a paper that I founvery interesting.	N
In it, they basically trieto lay out, I think, an approach that says there are some issues with respect to science policy that are essentially national security questions with respect to science.	N
Some of them come to mind, obviously, like dual use of technologies anthe like, anthat is separate from what is considerescience that woulbe totally divorcefrom terrorism annational security issues.	N
Do you share this view of the previous administration that there is really a discipline that ought to be appropriately callenational security science, anif not, what woulbe your differences from the Clinton administration, that this document seems to have investea considerable amount of effort anresearch to articulating this policy?	N
In this area, because you were not put on notice when we got together that this is something I was going to ask about, why do you not take the time to look at this particular paper angive me in writing your analysis of it, anparticularly areas where you might disagree.	N
I think it is a provocative paper, anthe notion that there really is a discipline known as national security science strikes me as an intriguing one.	N
I mean, clearly an investment in science antechnology is absolutely key to military preparedness.	N
That woulbe another example that woulcome to mind, anI woullike you to look at that paper.	N
Let me turn now to this question of the response to September 11 from the standpoint of technology.	N
People woulcall ansay, ``We are walking the streets as if we were in an undevelopeNation, looking for our relatives'', anpeople were posting pictures ansigns all over New York City.	N
I mean, it struck me, for example, that if medical authorities anmedical personnel haput a GPS bracelet on people right at the outset, that woulhave been a chance, for example, to use technology in a very modest sort of way to prevent some of the frustration that families anloveones were facing, anI think there is an opportunity here to do a significantly better job in terms of mobilizing the brains anthe talent anthe energy in the private sector to both prevent these kinds of tragedies, ansecond, to move quickly by way of the first response to deal with them, anthis Subcommittee is going to look at this.	N
Senator Allen has been very interestein this, anby the way, we do not see this as setting up some big Government kinof program.	N
I mean, if you have something which resemblea technology version of the National Guard, where you haat the ready the brains anthe equipment anthe talent ana clearinghouse where people coulgo to get this assistance, I think we coulmake vastly better use of all of this energy ancreativity in the private sector, anI woullike to know at the outset what you think about coordinating a better approach between the Government anthe private sector to both preventing these problems anmoving to responwhen you have them.	N
Let me give you a handful of ideas that the high technology companies gave to me yesterday at home in Portland, because I haa session with Intel anIBM anmany of the technology leaders, the wireless firms anothers, anhere are some suggestions they gave me, anI woulbe curious about your reaction to them.	N
They talkeabout the neefor better coordination of existing data networks so there woulbe a way to communicate in the time of an emergency.	N
They talkeabout the idea of a clearinghouse, a one-stop process to access people anequipment, where people coulgo to get the brains anthe equipment to deal with an emergency, anthe frustration that they founwhen that was not available.	N
They talkeabout the heefor ways in which high-tech companies coulshare information, share information about their various services without running afoul of the antitrust laws, anthere are some real legal questions with respect to how they do that.	N
Woulthese be the kinds of issues that you woulzero in on as our science policy leader, anmy reason for asking is not that you subscribe to every detail, but we have, as Senator Allen--I think it is fair to say Virginia anOregon are in the leanationally in terms of technology policy.	N
We hareally some of the premier technology executives spena couple of hours with me yesterday to talk about some of these ideas, anthese were some of their suggestions, anI think it woulsena real message if you as the Science Advisor said, ``These are the kinds of things I want to work on'', or maybe, ``I want to work on this'', ansomething else is more important.	N
Maybe there are things that you think make sense in addition, but I woulbe curious as to your response to that.	N
I have just one other area I want to talk about with you on this first round, anthen I am going to recognize my frienSenator Allen, but on this point, anI haa chance to talk about it with Mr. Bona little bit, the Subcommittee is going to holhearings, hopefully as soon as next week, on this issue of how the technology sector respondeon September 11, anI want to make it clear that my goal at this opening kinof rounof hearings is to look at all of the ideas that are out on the table.	N
In other words, I have talkeabout the idea of a technology version of the National Guard.	N
Since we have begun these discussions, anI spoke about it on the floor, scores of people have contacteus with ideas that sounvery creative anvery good, anI think it is our goal at the first rounof hearings to really get a cross-section of the ideas out on the table, ansee if we can fincommon points of agreement between these various efforts that are going on in the private sector, anthen look to see how we can work together to deal with it, anas I indicateto Mr. Bond, this is going to have to be something that ultimately the executive branch anthe President of the UniteStates woulhave to lead, anthat is why we are looking forwarto working closely with you too, anTom Ridge, in doing that, anour past history augers will for that kinof cooperative effort.	N
I want to talk about on this first round, if I could, with you, Dr. Marburger, is the question of coming up with some principles to try to guide scientific decisions, anI am not talking here, again, about passing some kinof law, or creating a Government program, but given the importance of scientific policymaking, ensuring that is done on the basis of merit, annot from corporate boardrooms, anpeople with agendas that are more junk than science.	N
I wanteto ask you about a handful of principles that have really struck me as central to coming up with sounscience, anget your reaction to those, anyou may have other ones, anyou may think this is completely off-base altogether.	N
The first that I mentioneis that sensible science shoulbe consistent with the majority of findings as publishein peer-revieweliterature.	N
That is a thoughtful answer, anI am asking these questions because I want to see how you are going to approach them, ansuffice it to say, ``I think it woulbe just deawrong to say that a brilliant idea cannot advance in America because it does not satisfy peer review analysis''.	N
A seconprinciple that--as I talkewith leaders in the field--has been important has been scientific inclusions anpolicy shoulsatisfy the standards of goopractice publisheby scientific societies, or organizations.	N
Again, that is a thoughtful answer, anone that I think fleshes out a little bit of what I am trying to do.	N
I want to see if we can work together with you to try to bring some light to the science questions that in many respects have become a kinof political football, annot something that really in the majority of cases addresses these questions of peer review ansounmethodology anthe like.	N
A thirarea that we have hearcontinually citeis that the principles useto support scientific policy shoulbe acceptable to a variety of scientific anengineering disciplines.	N
The fourth principle advancewas that policy shoulbe derivefrom a broarange of studies annot baseon a single set of findings.	N
The last question deals with essentially backing up a theory, can something actually be supported, anI think a lot of scientists see this as a question of whether empirical data supports the findings of predictive models.	N
I am going to recognize Senator Allen, anthen I will have some questions for you, anwe have not even gotten startewith you yet, Mr. Bond, but on this point, Dr. Marburger, I hope that, given the importance of science as it relates to policymaking at a time when there are not very many scientists in the U.S. Congress, anthere are not very many researchers, anwe are dependent on outside sources for scientific information to make these policy decisions, I hope that on your watch, when you hang them up, that one of the things that you will have helpeto do woulbe to have helpethe Congress anthe administration, working together, to decipher the lines between sounscience anjunk science when making policy decisions.	N
That is what I see to be a real priority on your watch, because it affects an array of issues which now, whether it is stem cell research, global climate change, or dominating most of what we talk about when we are not dealing with terrorism anthe events of September 11.	N
I think someone of your stature ansomeone like yourself, who has commandeso much respect in the scientific community, anobviously with Members of Congress already, can make a real difference here in terms of helping us set out some principles ansome processes, not laws anprograms, but principles for making sure that we are driving science policy on the basis of scientific merit annot something that comes from a corporate set of interests, or junk science.	D
I woulmake a few remarks, anthen I will let Dr. Marburger take a break anI will work over Mr. Bond.	N
Both these gentlemen antheir agencies that deal with science are going to be very important in technology for our future.	N
I have saion many occasions as well that our laws, our permitting, our regulations ought to be baseon sounscience, not political science, antoo often we do not listen to the actual sounscience, anyou anthe folks that you work with anthe agencies for which you all have responsibility will be very important to us in the area of biotechnology anin technology generally.	N
I always remember what de Toqueville once saiabout the UniteStates, anI kinof paraphrase it.	N
He said, ``In America the only things that have not been done are those that have yet to be imagined'', anI am one who very much dislikes limits, anwe shoulonly be limiteby our imagination, our ingenuity, our harwork, anindeed, in the area of biotechnology, much, virtually anything can be done, but there does neeto be ethical standards, anthose are tough decisions, but I think it is very important that we do listen to the scientists, to the physicians, to the technologists, to determine what are the facts, anthen they shoulmake the decisions, we shoulmake the decisions, but nevertheless it shoulbe baseon sounscience, anI very much agree with your comments in that regard.	N
The other matters I will get into as far as coordination of data networks anso forth, which I do think will be important, but that is another matter.	N
I woullike to quote back to you, Mr. Bond, your statement that--you dinot go through your whole statement, but this really is very much a part of what is great, anthe great potential of our country, in that in your written statement that you submitted, that you state that it is no accident that the UniteStates leads the worlin high technology, both civilian andefense.	N
Our achievements are the dividends that flow from sustainepublic anprivate sector investments in research andevelopment, couplewith America's entrepreneurial spirit anthe willingness to take risks.	N
Today, the private sector plays a dominant role in the process of developing new technologies anbringing them to market.	N
The Federal Government plays a pivotal role in creating the climate that supports the private sector's efforts.	N
In other words, the Government's role is to create the conditions precedent for people with gooideas aningenuity to test those ideas, take the risks, make the investments, create the jobs that let the marketplace decide whether or not that is a gooidea, or maybe somebody has a better idea, maybe it is less expensive, more efficient, less expensive, better quality, whatever it may be.	N
AnI like very much how you conclude this thought by saying you believe the Technology Administration can continue to make vital contributions to the Nation's technology base anour national policies that support private sector technology development, commercialization ancompetitiveness, anwe always neeto be looking at what is going to help the competitiveness of our country anour people anour society.	N
Now, we have an issue coming up very shortly that is expiring, which has to do with taxes antax policy anregulatory policy have an impact on our economy, anparticularly in technology.	N
One of the best advances in my view has been the Internet, which is a tremendous way of disseminating new ideas.	N
Now, there is going to be, if the House anSenate do not act, this tax that--the moratorium on Internet access taxes.	N
Now, what impact do you think will that have--if that moratorium expireanwas alloweto lapse, what impact do you think that woulhave on our economy?	N
Well, Senator Boxer, who is a Member of this Committee, Senator Boxer anI do not always agree on every issue.	N
While I prefer a permanent ban on access taxes, or discriminatory taxes, one has to be realistic here, anso we have joineup together to try to get that 5-year moratorium on it, anwe will neeall of your help to get that through on the Senate side, because clearly, adding tax burdens hardly is going to be helpful to the technology sector, which is undoubtedly--it was in bashape before September 11, anthere is nothing that has happenesince September 11 to indicate any up-tick in that regard.	N
As far as--anthis is to you, Dr. Marburger, anyou can answer this as well, as well as Mr. Bond.	N
They damagethe short-term productivity of certain key sectors of our economy, anthere is clearly a neeto restore the economy ansome of that is better security, improvesecurity.	N
There have been changes in some of the dynamics, or the paradigms, even for airline pilots as to what do you do if someone is trying to commandeer your aircraft, but there is a neeto improve our economy.	N
Now, what technologies, in either of you all's view--what technologies, whether they are existing or emerging technologies--do you see as potentially playing a key role in this recovery process, whether it is in security or the commercial economy generally?	N
Again, this coulbe governmental services, it coulbe the private sector, analso State, local, anFederal Governments, not just the Federal Government.	N
What technologies do you see as emerging in helping us restore our economy as well as enhance our security?	N
I woulato what our Chairman, Senator Wyden mentionewhen he was meeting with certain folks back home, in his home in Oregon, the coordination of the data networks, the bioinformatics, talking with Secretary Thompson last week, one of the keys is actually all of those data networks, anwe are still analyzing the anthrax attacks, or the anthrax incidents in Florida.	N
Originally it is going to come from the local health departments, the local emergency rooms, anit is absolutely critical in making sure--anI hate to use the worcritical unless it really is critical, but in that the sooner one can determine if somebody has that malady, whether it is anthrax, smallpox, whatever it might be, that there is a better chance they have to live.	N
Anthe conglomeration, or the coordination of that information, say there are a few people who have certain symptoms in one locality, say the hospital in one locality finds two people with those symptoms, then over the mountain in another valley, they have six or eight anso forth, none of these hospitals necessarily are talking with one another.	N
But if that information gets to the State, gets to the CDC, at least you see a pattern, that there may be some likelihooof something going on, as opposeto an isolateincident, anthat is where I think technology--anI do want to work with Senator Wyden on this to make sure that the bioinformatics are there so that we do have the prompt responses.	N
We are also going to have a hearing on Thursday here again on emergency coordination, anthe Chairman mentioneGPS for firefighters.	N
We are going to have a hearing for fire services anfirefighters, anmuch of it, while just listening to an officer who was trappein the rubble up in New York City with the WorlTrade Centers, anI think his name was Fuentas, anthey are trying to talk to him on whatever, whether it is a walkie-talkie, or whether it was a cell phone, regardless, they were having a hartime, in all of the dust anthe darkness, anhe coulnot say where he was.	N
If he hathat GPS on him, then they coulknow where he is, anhe coulbe in the midst of dust ansmoke anfire anso forth, that someone has just passeout, anthey are not going to be able to talk to one another, or that walkie-talkie or two-way radio or cell phone coulbe broken, but with that GPS they coulfinout, anfortunately they were able to finhim, but nevertheless we neeto learn from this disaster, or this terrorist attack, so that we can respond, anI think people responderemarkably well under the circumstances, but nevertheless, people want to responeven better in the future.	N
So you all will be very important, anyour agencies, to give us guidance, gooideas, whether it is for our first responders, the medics, the emergency squads, the firefighters, law enforcement or others, anagain, these are going to be pressing issues as well, anI am glato hear the Chairman say we are going to look at where technology can improve aviation safety.	D
I have seen some of the research that was done at Langley Research Center, anwhat can be done as far as flight patterns, anvirtual domes that can be put over certain buildings where a plane simply cannot fly into them.	N
Now, I am just going to finish with a broaquestion for you, because I do have a meeting in 2 minutes, or Mr. Bond, anI just think it is important for all of us to know where do you see your key role going to be?	N
What is going to be your top one or two priorities as Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, to ensure that our Nation's technology sector is healthy?	N
My view that there is no more important economic sector in our economy than the technology sector.	N
Yes, it is important for goojobs, good-paying jobs, it is important in manufacturing, so we have the most up-to-date, cleanest, most efficient, best quality methods of production, it is important for our health care, the life sciences, the medical sciences, it is important for communications, finance, education, it is vitally linketo technology and, indeed, our national defense is key to having us have a technological advantage, anwe must as a Nation have that competitive attitude that we always have to be at the cutting edge, in the lead, because it is vital for our security, it is vital for our prosperity anfor our quality of life.	N
So with those comments, where will be, in your view, your top two areas of concern to make sure our technology sector is leading, ancontinues to leain the future?	N
I have found, not having been in Government for a few years until getting electelast year, that there is a digital divide between the private sector anthe Federal Government, in the utilization anadaptation of new technologies.	N
Woulyou foresee yourself also having a role of making sure that the Federal Government anits agencies will adopt the latest technologies, whether for their own internal communications--you see it in the State Department.	N
I am on Foreign Relations, on that Committee, anit is amazing to me to reathese reports that they coulnot even e-	N
mail within the same embassy, much less some outpost into Washington to the State Department, anI am glaSecretary Powell is there.	N
He was on the AOL board, anrecognizes there are better ways to communicate, anthat is not just for communications of our policy, but for the security, to know instantly what is going on anwhat is our policy, anwhat is to be said.	D
So I woulhope that you also use it as a way for just internally--it woulalmost be like a CIO, so to speak, chief information officer, to make sure that you use these policies wherever possible anpractical to save the taxpayer's money anprovide better service to the public, contract out some of these services, because you coulspenmoney, you can waste money more quickly on technology than about anything else, anit is important to get the most up to date, anif you can outsource some of that, sometimes that woulbe the best way for the taxpayers anthe services, so woulyou make a commitment to also, in the midst of that deploying technologies, try to educate all Federal Government agencies.	N
I have been made chairman of the High Tech Task Force for the Republicans in the Senate, anthat is exactly the term we said.	N
Whenever you get your e-mail address after the confirmation, we will certainly want to get it there so you can get all those gooideas.	D
I thank you for your insight anyour testimony, anI know I speak for everyone on this Committee, we look forwarto working with you to improve the lives of all Americans analso the world, so thank you so much.	N
Before my colleague leaves, let me just say how much I appreciate the comments you have made.	N
These clearly are areas where if you do not have a bipartisan front in terms of science antechnology policy, it is not going to get done, so I am really pleaseyou are taking such an active role.	N
We are going to have a fielhearing at Langley to look at those aviation technology issues you are talking about, anI very much look forwarto working with you, anI have got some more questions for our two nominees, but I know you have got to run, anI just appreciate you spending all this time.	N
Dr. Marburger, I want to talk now about your role in the White House, anwhat your role is going to be specifically as a Science Advisor.	N
It is our understanding that previous Science Advisors were designateas Assistant to the President with the privileges anduties that applies, including sitting in on Cabinet meetings, anhaving direct access to the President of the UniteStates.	N
On the other hand, there have been a number of press reports indicating that you are going to be designatesomething callea Special Assistant.	N
Now, I do not know if any of this is accurate, anI think it woulbe helpful for you to set out, on the basis of the conversations you have hawith the President of the UniteStates, how you see your role as Science Advisor for our country.	N
Well, that is encouraging, anyou are absolutely right, titles, we can all have titles, but direct access to the President is important, anI gather you have now been given the assurance that you will have direct access to the President on issues that are important as it relates to science.	N
I mean, obviously there were a lot of big science issues that generatea great deal of public discussion long before September 11.	N
I will tell you I think it is almost unprecedentefor a scientific issue in the deaof summer to generate the attention that the stem cell research debate generated.	N
I think it is literally unprecedentein sort of the dog days of August, when most Americans are at the beach, that we are having debates at virtually every kitchen table in the country with respect to stem cell research anthe implications for health anscience anentrepreneurship anthe like.	N
Were you consulteon the stem cell issue, anif so, without violating any confidences, what was your general counsel?	N
Well, that is something that I was trying to be sensitive to as well, anI want to ask you your views on a handful of other important scientific issues, again not to try to get you to commit to sort of one bill or one program or another, but to try to assess a little bit how you are approaching some of these issues, anthat is why I askethe previous question in a general sort of way, anunderstanthe sensitivity of the matters, anthe fact that you are going to be in the room, anbe in a position to make sure that you can get your views on science issues, which we respect very much, heard, is one that I am interestein.	N
Frankly, if we dinot have respect for your backgrounanyour expertise, we woulnot make such a push ansuch a point of stressing it.	D
I have been concerneat the number of private companies anthe number of private donors that were in effect already committeto funding stem cell research who are walking away, anare walking away as a result of the administration's policy in this area.	N
There were several, for example, op epieces in the Wall Street Journal after the President's decision, with large donors saying we do not think we are going to be in a position in this climate to ensure that the important research that needs to go forwaris going to be possible.	N
Set aside the question of whether there is X number of stem cell lines available or not, antell me whether you are troubleby the fact that a number of private companies have abandonetheir plans in this country anare moving overseas to pursue stem cell research as a result of the administration's decision.	N
Well, I hope that you will, as your answer suggests, monitor carefully what goes on in the private sector, because I know I was troubleby the fact that those private companies that do not have an ideological orientation to these kinds of things were saying that we are going to pack up, we are going to go overseas, anif you are saying, anyour answer is a gooone, that you are going to monitor this, anthat you want to have a strategy to get some of these people back, anto do it in line with ethical standards for research, then I appreciate that answer, anit is a gooone.	N
Let me talk to you about global climate change for a minute, antry to see if I can understanwhat the administration's position is from a scientific standpoint.	N
As I understanit, we are essentially now standing out there by ourselves with 180 countries or thereabouts not being in accorwith our view, anas I understanthe administration's position, the theory is that the administration will funvarious kinds of experimental efforts anresearch kinof efforts, anthe theory is, is that when these efforts go forwarthey are going to produce data aninformation which somehow is going to get these other 180 countries to stop what they think makes sense ango at it our way.	N
How woulyou characterize where we are on the global climate change issue from a scientific standpoint, anwhere we stanon this issue, anhow, if at all, you intento be involvein it?	N
When are we likely to see those programs, the ones that seem to be being offereas an alternative?	N
Because I will tell you, I am troubleby the fact that we are out there by ourselves, with 180 countries joining hands, anthe UniteStates essentially outside that, but I am even more troublethat I do not understanessentially how we are going to funsome of these important scientific projects anuse it to buila consensus to be part of an effort that has us joining the rest of the world.	N
Senator Brownback, for example, he anI joineforces on carbon sequestration with respect to agriculture antimber.	N
We think what we are doing in terms of carbon sequestration might, in a way that woulbe supporteby agriculture anenvironmental people, anyour scientists anthe like, help us to deal with perhaps 25 percent of the global warming problem.	N
That is not 100 percent, but to deal with 25 percent of the problem in a bipartisan kinof way ain't baby Washington, DC standards, anI woulvery much like to have you, as these additional scientific initiatives go forwarwhere you look at various approaches, anpresumably finscience that you consider acceptable antry to persuade other countries to do it, to take an active role on it, anto work with us to speeit up, because this message that we are going to stanout there by ourselves, while 180 other people can make an agreement, I think is very unfortunate.	N
If we go any further with this, I am only likely to get you in trouble, because if there is consensus on science, then what seems plausible to me is what is holding it up is politics, anthat, of course is outside your bailiwick.	N
Let me ask you a question to follow up on Senator Allen's goopoint about Internet taxes.	N
We have hadiscussions among the Members of this Committee, very constructive discussions among Members of this Committee, Senator Dorgan, Senator Hollings, Senator McCain anothers, anwhat can the administration do to help us break the gridlock anget this resolved?	N
My sense is, if the President says, ``Ron Wyden anJohn McCain put in a 2-year bill, angiven this difficult economic situation I want to see that bill passed'', I think that is the one that goes through the U.S. Senate.	N
If the President wants something else, I think it woulbe very helpful to hear from the Administration now.	N
What can you tell me in terms of how the Administration can help break the gridlock up here on this?	N
As you know, it is my view that there is not a single jurisdiction in this country, not a single local governmental body that can show that they have been hurt by their inability to discriminate against the Internet, anthat is all the current law says.	N
The current law always says you cannot tax the Internet as if you were creating some kinof Cayman Islands with the Internet.	N
You just have to treat the offline worllike you treat the online world, anI woulhope that the administration woulweigh in aggressively here for one of the bills that is going to extenthe moratorium anlet us get on with it, because the last thing the economy needs now is to set up a crazy quilt of local anState taxes, which is what coulcome about if, for example, the Congress adjourns anthe moratorium is not extended, anI think you know that, Phil, anjust convey the urgency of it.	N
Let us talk a bit about the portal idea that you see for small business, anlike Senator Allen, I am very supportive of this, anI think it can make a real difference, particularly for small businesses, which I know you have been very interestein.	N
How do you see this creating opportunities for small businesses in particular through the portal?	N
How do you envisage your position anyour watch interacting with the communications side of the technology debate?	N
For example, I am very interested, ana lot of Members of this Committee are very interestein the question of spectrum policy.	N
I woullike to see marketplace forces introduceinto the allocation of spectrum in our country.	N
A number of our colleagues woulas well, anI am not completely clear how Commerce is going to divide up how spectrum policy is made.	N
I assume Ms. Victor is going to be involvein this, anyou anMr. Mellman anothers, but perhaps you coultell us a little bit about how your office is going to work on the communications side of technology policy.	N
Well, this, anI think the Secretary knows that I have a great interest in this, as do a number of Members of the Committee.	N
This is a perfect area to try to builsome new incentives to create efficiencies, anthey do not exist now.	N
Basically, if you got something 2 decades ago just hang onto it, you can basically holeverybody hostage, anwe are going to be anxious to work with you on it.	N
In my office, you assureme that you woultransmit to the administration anto Mr. Ridge our interest in working to try to coordinate the private sector responses to what happeneon September 11 with technology.	N
I just want to give you a chance to say publicly what you saiin my office on that point.	N
So to have the administration saying sign me up is great, anwe are just finalizing plans on that, anMr. Bond, you have been great, anvery accessible, anI appreciate it.	N
Senator Schumer wanteto convey to Dr. Marburger his strong support for you, ana letter from Senator Chuck Schumer needs to go into the recorat this point as well.	N
I want to ask you a couple of things about the nanotechnology initiative, which strikes me as very promising, anthey are going to deal with both the coordination question anthe substance.	N
We have got six agencies already that seem to be part of the nanotechnology initiative, anwe are going to neeyou anyour colleagues to some extent to bring people together, or the GAO will be writing reports on nanotechnology 2 years from now anthey will say, so-and-so diit, anso-and-so diexactly the same thing, anwhy weren't those characters on the Science anTechnology Subcommittee watching it.	N
I have felt for a long time that there is nothing partisan about the matters that we are talking about and, in fact, if you cannot get bipartisan agreement in key areas like we are talking about today, like combatting terrorism, that research is not going to get done in our country, anwe are going to suffer as a result.	N
Fortunately, there has been a bit more bipartisanship since September 11, anwith two goopeople like yourselves taking on these key positions, I think you can help us advance that bipartisanship in an important area, anI will tell you, because I have haa chance to both listen to you anto meet with you, that I have very high expectations for you two.	N
I have expectations of you two that I woulnot normally have for people that come before this Committee, or any Committee in the U.S. Senate, anI think you are going to meet them, anso I thank you very much.	N
If there is anything the two of you woullike to afurther, we will welcome it, or otherwise we will adjourn.	N
This is our first day back, anI woulhave rather helthis at 9:30 this morning, but we coulnot.	N
This is an extremely important nomination, anI hope soon to be a confirmation out of this Committee prior to September 11, anhopefully in the Senate.	N
I know that your husband, Dr. Bill Dooley, is here anthat Mona, your daughter, is here as well.	N
We are very happy to welcome you along with Michael Jackson, our Deputy Secretary; analso you, ConraBurns, who I have not seen in a month, but we have made it through.	N
The FAA Administrator is one of the four or five most difficult positions, least understoopositions, in the entire Federal Government, anenormously important.	N
I think it is not useful in most of our functions, but sometimes in terms of oversight it is necessary.	N
We get a little oversight from our constituents, you get a little oversight from Congress, anthe democracy has heltogether pretty well for over 220 years.	N
I do not think she was displeaseto leave, which was interesting, because it is part of the pressure that you are constantly under.	N
Today, after 5 years of her tenure, there are major airport expansion projects arounthe country.	N
In my opinion, the FAA has a better-establisherelationship with air traffic controllers another employees than at any time in the 18 years that I have been on this Committee anin the Senate.	N
I know it, anI know you, so I feel that I can say that without fear of contradiction from my conscience.	N
So you do your goojob at NTSB, anyou move on to something which is even more complicateanin the public eye.	N
There can be no doubt that these challenges are daunting ana few of them will include safety--the FAA's primary mission.	N
But since September 11th members of this Committee, with all of us here in Congress, have been consumeby security-relateissues.	N
But on the other hand, September 11th made clear to everybody how much work needs to be done in this area.	N
Our work on transportation security does not make transportation safety any less important.	N
Indeed, given the difficulties that the aviation sector has experiencein the wake of September 11, it is even more critical that we continue to improve the industry's safety record, anto win back the confidence, in any way that we can of the public.	N
It is a little bit of a mystery in some ways, part of the American psyche, part of the times, but nevertheless it is a problem anairlines are reacting to it in ways which are not serving some of us in small States in ways that we particularly like.	N
Last month Secretary Mineta anAdministrator Garvey indicatethe FAA may have to furlough air traffic service employees if additional moneys were not appropriated.	N
Since that time, Congress has appropriatesome additional funding, but not the amount requesteby the Federal Aviation Administration.	N
I am hoping that your testimony will address both your thoughts on the immediate budget situation anon ways we can deal with the issue over the longer term.	N
We finally passea decent authorization bill, but we basically have been ignoring aviation infrastructure for all of these years.	N
Some of us have starteto look back wistfully to last summer, when congestion was the most pressing issue facing the aviation industry.	N
The O'Hare modernization bill, which is something I, as Subcommittee Chairman, feel tremendously strong about--there has been some controversy, but not a great deal, anI think it has to happen.	N
It sort of determines what happens in all kinds of other places, like North Dakota anWest Virginia, anI do not know about Arizona, but I suspect Montana, anprobably Arizona.	N
Senator Hutchison, who is my ranking member, anreally we are co-chairs, she is absolutely terrific; we authorea bill that woulhave streamlinethe whole process of getting runways under way.	N
You face a number of challenges in this area, including how to replace retiring air traffic controllers, contract negotiations with the air traffic controllers union, ancontroversies surrounding the deployment of new equipment.	N
Some stunning figures: a June 2002 GAO study founthat approximately 5,000 controllers may retire in the next 5 years, which--``may'' usually means ``will''--is twice the rate of the last 5 years.	N
By 2010, GAO estimates that a total of 7,000 will retire, almost 50 percent of the 15,000 air traffic controllers who now operate.	N
Most of the FAA's aviation security functions have been transferreto the new Transportation Security Administration.	N
The FAA Administrator will nonetheless have a large role, particularly in those areas where security ansafety issues intersect, anthere are plenty of those.	N
Your management of the air traffic control system, for example, has both safety ansecurity implications.	N
The same goes for pilot licensing, aircraft design specifications, reinforcecockpit doors.	N
I have a number of questions that I want to ask, as I am sure others do, anthey have statements, anI apologize mine is so long.	N
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing on the nomination of Ms. Blakey to serve as the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.	N
As we all know, Jane Garvey, who servewith distinction as Administrator of the FAA for the past 5 years, left at the enof her term on August 4th.	D
It is important that we ensure that the FAA has strong leadership to continue the legacy establisheby Administrator Garvey.	D
I initially hasome doubts about the depth anbreadth of Ms. Garvey's aviation experience prior to her being nominateas the FAA Administrator.	D
However, I believe Ms. Blakey has exhibitestrong leadership qualities in her most recent position as Chairman of the NTSB, in addition to many other roles helwithin the Federal Government over the years.	D
The confirmation of a new Administrator will mark the seconappointment after Congress enactethe 5-year term provision.	N
The 5-year term is key to the FAA's ability to maintain its independence anits status as the premier aviation safety agency in the world.	N
The extendeterm of the administrators anthe agency's independence make it essential that its leader be unswayeby party loyalties anunaffecteby political winds.	N
As you just stated, Mr. Chairman, the new administrator will face numerous challenges in the coming months anyears.	N
Since September 11th, much attention has been focuseon the new Transportation Security Administration.	N
The FAA has continueto operate well, but has not facethe Congressional scrutiny over the past year that it normally attracts.	N
That is going to change in light of so many issues that will soon confront our new air transportation system.	N
In addition to security, we will neeto focus on building new runways aninfrastructure anexpanexisting capacity.	N
Further, the collective bargaining agreement between the air traffic controllers anthe agency is set to expire.	N
I cannot remain for the entire hearing either, but I diwant to come today to say I support this nomination.	N
But again, this is a goochoice anI am going to be supporting Ms. Blakey's nomination ando so with enthusiasm.	N
There is a chief operating officer position, a COO, that we authorizein Congress in 1999.	N
I expect, Ms. Blakey, as you assume this job--anI believe the Congress certainly will move to support your nomination--as you assume this job, I am guessing that you will very much want these other positions to be filled.	N
I hope the administration will senus names of the quality that they have sent for the Administrator's job.	D
But we do--I think, given the challenges that we face, we neeto have the deputy, we neeto have the COO that was authorizeby Congress.	N
I wouljust like to mention that we face a lot of challenges in air travel, especially commercial air travel, these days.	N
I mean, you open up a paper anyou see the potential bankruptcy of some of the largest carriers, a troubleeconomy anwhat that spells for the aviation industry.	N
Anyou are going to try to run a system that is the largest air traffic control system in the world, be responsible for aviation safety anoversee funds for the construction of the infrastructure.	D
So we want to work with you ansee that you do that job well anhelp you do that job well.	N
It seems to me that there is a reluctance sometimes on the part of Federal agencies to use resources that the Federal Government has already investein anpaifor.	N
We have at the University of North Dakota what is often referreto as the Harvarof the Sky, the Center for Aerospace Science, in fact one of the preeminent centers in the country.	N
They, among other things, train air traffic controllers, anthey have done contracts with the FAA.	N
I have been there anI have watcheon both sides of the same boarRussian air traffic controllers being trained, talking to Chinese air traffic controllers in the same room, with an air traffic control boarseparating them.	N
That is done at an educational institution with Federal investment having been made over the last dozen years or so.	N
I really want the FAA to take a look at those capabilities that exist arounthe country, not just at this institution, but at others as well, to finout how you can use that investment that has already been made to help you train more anmore air traffic controllers as you neethem.	N
You will hear a great deal about that from Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, anmyself as we go along.	N
I wish you well anI will certainly vote for your confirmation with enthusiasm anlook forwarto working with you.	N
I happen to believe that we made a couple of mistakes in our airport security bill annow we are sort of paying for that anseeing what can actually happen when you create something anit is never uncreated, in fact it becomes a giant that we cannot handle.	N
Now they are telling us there that they are going to have to have 76 screeners in Bozeman, Montana, that loads aroun225,000 people a year.	N
If they just run arounover each other, maybe they will have a hartime getting through each other to help folks out with their bags.	N
But we have createthis annow we are seeing what can happen when we, maybe with goointentions, but we also have some unintentional things happening that do not make us any safer anthere is no way they can make us any safer.	N
We have a couple of areas up there that we have been trying to get their attention the last--ever since I have been here--14 years; anso far I guess we have not made a strong enough case.	N
But I hope that you will take our recommendations antake a look into it ansee what we can do to fix it.	N
You understand, Ms. Blakey, that the best time to ask the questions is before confirmation.	N
I think you are going to be a great FAA Administrator anI have hathe opportunity to get to know you a little bit.	N
I think you have a superb recorof public service in a variety of transportation-relateposts, most recently at the National Transportation Safety Board.	N
I think one of the biggest things the country is going to have to confront in upcoming years is how we change from a radar-baseair traffic control system to a global positioning satellite system.	N
The FAA has hadifficulty implementing new air traffic control systems in the past anso I think there will be significant managerial issues that you will confront.	N
But I am convinced, on the basis of a review of your recoranhaving met you in person on a couple of occasions anhaving hathe opportunity to talk to you, that you have the makings of a fine FAA Administrator.	N
I am glathat the Committee is moving expeditiously here, because we cannot have that post vacant for too long.	N
So my thanks to the Chairman for having this hearing our first day back from the August break.	N
Welcome, Ms. Blakey, anwe will look forwarto talking to you in the question ananswer section.	N
It is, I think, the greatest new technology since radar anreally is going to improve our aviation system greatly.	N
Alaska has seven times more pilots per capita than the national average, so if you want to learn something about flying come up our way.	N
You have probably the most important job for Alaska that I can think of within the Administration, other than the fellow that lives at 1600 Pennsylvania.	N
We are making great progress right now because of work that your agency has done along with various other agencies dealing with past fatalities in our aviation community.	N
Safety is on the front burner in Alaska anwe neeyour help to make sure those programs go through, like the Medallion program--a totally volunteer, industry-conceiveanindustry-operateprogram.	N
You cannot tell Alaskan pilots what to do from Washington, but you can let them tell themselves what to do from Alaska, anit is working very well.	N
I certainly look forward, anI have reayour remarks, Ms. Blakey, to your being the Administrator of the FAA.	D
The Administrator of the FAA has always been a very important position--enormously important--anvital to our economy, communities, the States, anjobs.	N
In our economy, obviously, how the aviation industry is moving does have an impact on jobs.	N
I am glato see that you have noticethe neefor air traffic control modernization analso, now more than ever since September 11th, the neefor security.	N
I woulsay, Mr. Chairman, that Ms. Blakey is an outstanding choice to be Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.	D
You have impressive credentials anbackground, anI commenthe President for this outstanding choice.	D
Now, I will certainly, anI think this Committee will, work with you for the modernization of the air traffic control system.	N
I am pleasethat in your written responses to the Committee's questions, you mention air traffic control modernization as one of your top priorities in the first 2 years of your administration of FAA.	N
I encourage you to look at new technologies, how technology can help us in scheduling, in creating virtual domes arounprotecteareas--whether they are nuclear power plants or buildings such as the Capitol or others.	N
Senator DoanI will be introducing or planning to introduce an aeronautics revitalization bill this month intendeto reverse the trenof reducefunding for aeronautics research andevelopment.	N
The bill will hopefully include provisions addressing air traffic control management anmodernization issues.	N
Secretary Mineta at a hearing on aviation security here in May, when querieby me on the situation, saithat the plan woulbe announceby the enof the month.	N
We then haanother hearing in July, anI askehim again about the Department's plan to open Reagan National to general aviation.	N
We are now nearly a year from the tragic events, anReagan National remains closeto general aviation.	N
It is my hope that we can work together to finthe right security, the right procedures, so that we can have secure general aviation back at Reagan National Airport.	N
If they hatheir way, Reagan National woulprobably be closeto commercial aviation as well.	N
So we neeto builgoosecurity, sounsecurity, enhanceobviously for Reagan National, but get it back open for general aviation.	N
Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing in such a timely manner, anI look forwarto working with you anhearing your responses to various questions.	N
Let me just say, first of all, Ms. Blakey, we welcome this opportunity to explore some issues with you.	N
I hasome reservations about proceeding earlier on this anI want you to know that it has nothing to do with the question of your qualifications whatsoever.	N
You are eminently qualifieanI think it is important to, obviously, get somebody in this job.	D
But I dithink it was important to try to signal concern that a number of us have about existing employees within the FAA who are members of AFSCME who haa contract that has been in existence--let me just say, that was agreeupon between the FAA at the enof the Clinton Administration, anthere is a disagreement between the parties now as to what procedure might have been followeafter that.	N
But for an unknown reason it has been sent to OMB anit has sort of been helthere, which was not part of the agreement at the enof the Clinton Administration.	N
So there are some 2,000 employees whose morale is low, whose capacities are not being utilizeto the fullest as a consequence of this situation.	N
I do not think that anyone is well serveby having a year ana half go by in which the contract sort of sits in limbo.	N
The message that is sent by that is I suppose discernible, if indeethat is the message that is meant to be sent.	N
If it is not the message that is meant to be sent, then there is no reason not to complete the mission, so to speak.	N
Second, Boston Logan Airport is one of the few places in the country that is going to meet the screening deadline on time.	N
We are prouof that, particularly because of the sad, tragic association of that airport with the events of last year.	N
But it is having great trouble getting compensation under the TSA for the expenditures anfor the layout.	N
I think again, if there is going to be that kinof sort of slow response--I know that is not directly under you.	N
I think you as a prospective Administrator will have an enormous capacity to be able to have an impact on those kinds of decisions because you still will have a very serious role with respect to airport safety.	N
The final comment I just want to make very quickly is there are a whole slew of issues, obviously, which for a long time have been subject to enormous bureaucratic resistance.	N
But somehow the economy anthe safety of our airways anthe capacity of our airports to be maximizeanof our ability to move goods anpeople, both of which are essential for the growth of our country, are restraineas a result, just because there is this inertia, this unwillingness to try anmove anmake decisions, whether it was getting screening equipment into airports or whether it is resolving some of the airway congestion.	N
Speaking to what Senator Allen just said, there seems to be a defiance of common sense in some of the security procedures ansome of the ways in which we are approaching decisions about aircraft routes anflights anso forth.	N
There has to be a way that one can create a clearance system for general aviation with pilots, many of whom are ex-American military, who have security clearances, who have all the ability in the worlthrough codes, transponders, another things to signal whether there is a problem on the tarmac or whether there has been a hijack, whatever.	N
There are ways to create a system that does not have to shut down commercial enterprise the way we are today.	N
There are ways to facilitate the flow of people through our airports with the modern technology of personal identification that we have today, to be able to create less lines, less backup, anless sort of stupid--the story, I know it is a nice symbol to have Al Gore stoppewith everybody else, with his arms out anso forth, being searched.	N
But if everybody does in fact know who that person is, while four other people may pass by who might better have been servewith that kinof search, it does not make sense, anI do not think anybody here thinks it does make sense.	N
So there has to be, I hope, a way to try to streamline the capacity of our country to sort of facilitate people's flow through airports anto again de-congest the airways, which have been an ongoing problem for some perioof time, more rapidly anmore effectively.	N
I really hope that you will set about to rapidly examine antry to implement those methodologies.	N
I might just mention, Ms. Blakey, that in flying home from one of our many, many flights from West Virginia to this area last night, I went through a complete search antook my shoes off, anit was good.	N
My point is that it is not--the people who were doing it were sort of embarrasseabout it.	N
But I, evidently, hasomething in my shoe or something that botherethem anthey hato do that.	N
In fact, other passengers were watching it anI think it sort of democratizethe process.	N
You know, everybody gets the same treatment, anif you are going to be security conscious you have got to be security conscious on an equal basis.	N
I do not mean to disagree specifically with the example of Senator Kerry, but I was glaI went through that process last night.	N
The Secretary indicatethat he hato have $100 million anhe was appropriate$42 million with another $33 million that coulhave come out of the Airport Trust Fund.	N
Now, being involvewith aviation as I am, I think it is essential that Congress do what is necessary to keep our aviation system moving anhaving it fully staffed.	N
So I am wondering, how do you react to this question of shortfall, potential large or medium-sizeshortfall in terms of funding, particularly as it affects inspectors ancontrollers?	N
You can talk for however long you want, anI apologize to your husbananto your daughter.	N
Let me just go back to, again going to the 5-minute rule, to the question that I originally asked.	N
We hear it really in so many fields now, in teaching, but for the purposes of this you have that many air traffic controllers retiring, 50 percent.	N
It takes a long time to train anthen to develop the experience of one of these air traffic control people to be able to operate.	N
So my question to you obviously is, to the extent that you have haa chance to think about it--anI understanthat you are still at NTSB--how do you look at that situation?	N
It has been interesting to me, Ms. Blakey, that in a number of agencies--intelligence agencies, law enforcement, social workers--that is not an agency, but a profession--teaching, Peace Corps, VISTA, all kinds of things that are associatewith the public gooas well as with public safety, there has been a remarkably sharp increase in the number of applications to do that work.	N
That does not necessarily mean--of course, that was also true with screeners--that everybody who applies is going to be able to get there or ought to get there.	N
Has there been any similar expression of interest, more applications, that you are aware of that have made themselves available for that field?	N
I hope that--my time is about to run out--FAA will not be afraito market that position, because it combines a lot of qualities that people want, mathematics, so to speak, computers, console, dark room intensity, fast decisionmaking, teamwork, danger, enormous responsibility, anought to be in anof itself very, very attractive.	N
Even though it is exhausting for people who have been through it, it shoulhave great appeal.	N
It woulseem to me that that is one of the things we coulexplore, how to make that appear to be anin fact draw people out as a very attractive kinof work.	N
That is why I am trying to ask you about some specific issues, to get a sense of how you are going to approach them.	N
Here the Transportation Security Administration again has a learesponsibility, but the Federal Aviation Administration has a key role to play with the airports, anthe airports are going to be out there installing all those scanners.	N
My sense is, if this problem is not resolvein the next few months there is going to be absolute chaos, because we are going to have a busy travel season.	N
It basically says, I am not going to reathe whole thing, very little substantive has been done in the last 6, 7 months.	N
But I can tell you, I do not think it has been anywhere near what it needs to be, anunless you can sort out with the Transportation Security Administration some of these key issues--anI am talking about in the next 60 days--I think there is just going to be chaos this holiday season.	N
Let me turn now to the question of the agency's bureaucracy, anparticularly these costly antime-consuming certification procedures that seem to be holding up getting new ansafer aircraft anequipment out there.	N
Now, what we hear from the general aviation community is that they are particularly concernethat these certification procedures are keeping technological improvements, improvements that woulabsolutely translate into areas of increasesafety, that they are the ones that are not being made a high priority.	N
Can you give us some assurance that, as it relates to certification processes for technological improvements on safety, that you will make that a top priority?	N
Senator Burns, before I call on you I just wondereif Senator Snowe has any comments she wants to make.	N
We have been trying to take care of that dark spot arounBozeman anButte anHelena a long time.	N
I am going to ask you a couple questions, anI do not know where it goes or where it ends up.	N
But somebody is going to run into one another up there one of these days anthey are going to say: Golly, we shoulhave done that 14 years ago.	N
I am aware there has been reports that unairworthy or not properly testeor certifieparts are being placeinto aircraft anengines during their maintenance, repair, anoverhaul cycles, often through so-callePMAs--that is, parts manufacturer's approvals.	N
I also understanthat the FAA has been working on a complete rewrite of its certification procedures for products anparts, Part 21, for the past decade, but it is boggedown anno final rule has been issued.	N
It is the same thing that this Senator that was sitting right here saiabout when are they going to write the rules for the GranCanyon.	N
I am not looking to aany new regulatory burdens on aircraft owners or operators, but it seems to me that the FAA needs to be doing more to ensure that when the work is done to repair anreplace parts on aircraft or their engines, it does not degrade the original safety margins of the equipment.	N
We woullike for those rules to be written anI woullike for them to be reporteback to this Committee, anespecially to me.	N
I am to the enof my rope as far as trying to do some safety things with radar in that little triangle area of Butte, Helena, anBozeman, anI am not getting anywhere there anhe is not getting anywhere on the rules anregulations.	N
There is no excuse for not writing the rules anputting them into effect, at least put them out there where they are open for criticism.	N
As far as screening is concerned, I still think the screening thing--we are discriminateagainst, those of us who wear boots.	N
You cannot have any holes in them now anexpect your wife to speak to you after you go through the screen, No. 1.	N
So I woullike to have your commitment today that that will be high on your priority list once you are confirmed, anI am going to vote for your confirmation, but I want to see something happen down there, Ms. Blakey, I really do, because we have waitelong enough.	N
Well, we are talking about something--anI just want your commitment to that, anexplain to those folks who wrote them rules that maybe they shoulseek employment somewhere else.	N
I wanteto ask a question about something that happeneunder Jane Garvey's years at the FAA.	N
I think she in general dia very goojob, but there was one issue that I disagreewith her on.	D
She urgeCongress to pass a law that liftedelay controls at various airports where there was more demanthan the airport hacapacity for.	N
By 1969 it was at full capacity, ansince 1969 demanhas always exceedecapacity at O'Hare.	N
But in 1969 the FAA put in regulations, delay control regulations to prevent airlines from scheduling more flights at O'Hare than the airport hacapacity to handle.	N
But as soon as Ms. Garvey urgeCongress to lift those delay controls, we passea statute that overrode anwipeout regulations that the FAA put into effect in 1969, delays shot through the roof at O'Hare anthe traveling public has been brought to its knees at O'Hare because the airlines that operate there are alloweto schedule as many flights as they woullike, regardless of the airport's capacity.	N
So I guess--I know that since then the FAA has changeits position with respect to LaGuardia anthey have reimposedelay controls at LaGuardia.	N
We have to endure a system in which the airport has capacity in gooweather for maybe 220 flights an hour.	N
The oldelay controls I think useto make the airlines schedule an average of about 180 flights an hour.	N
Now they can schedule as many as they want, which often means that travelers at O'Hare have no chance of getting off the grounat their scheduledeparture time.	N
Our newspapers in Chicago, the Sun-Times anthe Tribune, have done exposes showing that at some moments of the day--I think 8:45 is a very popular time to fly--the airlines will schedule 25 or more flights to take off at 8:45 in the morning, even though the airport only has capacity for three flights to take off at that time.	N
Woulyou be adverse to looking at that issue anseeing if there is not a better way that we coulmanage delays by somehow preventing the airlines--I know they have a problem; they cannot sit down anwork out their schedules together because that woulraise antitrust issues.	N
Do you have any thoughts on this issue, or is it something you just woulapproach with an open mind?	N
With respect to air traffic control, as we neemore anmore capacity in this country there will be a lot of people urging you to bring flights closer together, to allow procedures at airports such as LAHSO, LanAnHolShort, procedures that potentially cut the margin of safety.	N
When you have to make those kinof decisions, how do you go about balancing safety on the one hananefficiency on the other hand?	N
I was vacationing in Colorado over the recess anhathe opportunity to go visit NORAD in Colorado Springs, anin talking to the Air Force people there they leme to believe that every military plane already has global positioning satellite navigation anthat they use it for their own purposes anthat they are way aheaof commercial aviation in this country.	N
The chairman of Unitewhen I first got sworn into office 4 years ago was telling me about that, anit still has not happened.	N
Is there anything that you can do to speethe realization of global positioning satellite technology on commercial aircraft in this country anhaving it take over our traffic management from the radar-basesystem that we now have?	N
I hope we have a speedy confirmation here in the Senate anI look forwarto working with you in the months anyears to come.	N
I am gratifieto hear that even the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee gets checkewhen he goes through his hometown airport for schedule purposes in West Virginia.	N
I think that your appointment sends a very important signal to this country due to your considerable backgrounwith the National Transportation Safety BoaranGovernment service.	N
I am impressewith your knowledge on the issues of safety, of making safety the first anforemost priority, anhaving the depth anbreadth of understanding of those issues anthe implications for the traveling public.	D
I think there is no question, in the aftermath of September 11th, that safety is clearly a major, major priority for this Congress anfor this country.	N
I know in the past, as others have mentionehere in the Committee, that with respect to the National Transportation Safety Boarmany of the policies anrecommendations that have been made have not been implementeby the FAA.	N
I hope that you will take a look at some of those issues in this position, because I do think it is critical for the future to really look at some of the safety recommendations to ensure that we have the highest standards possible in this country for the traveling public.	N
So I welcome you, because I do think that with your skills anleadership it clearly can continue to put FAA at the forefront on those issues that are so important to this country.	D
One of the areas that has been a problem for somebody that represents the State of Maine, anI know the Chairman in West Virginia, is that we are rural States, anthe implications of the type of policies that do come from the FAA do have disparate implications for a small rural State versus more urban States anmore urban communities.	N
For example, recently the FAA issuea policy that allowefor the construction of the sixth runway at Logan Airport, but it was conditional on developing a peak pricing plan, so that they woulincrease the fees for those slots antimes that obviously were at peak times during the course of the day.	N
In the past when that policy has been tried, it clearly has haramifications for small States that rely on small regional carriers.	N
Today they have one service between Boston anPresque Isle anthat is through the Essential Air Service Program.	N
So I am asking you to really consider the implications of policies that affect small anmedium-sizecommunities versus urban areas, because clearly when the decision is made, for example, by Logan Airport anits authority, they are going to make a decision that is obviously going to affect those that carry the least number of passengers.	N
Obviously, coming from a rural area, we are not going to have the big jets going into Logan.	N
Obviously, we are very concernein Maine because it will ultimately affect small regional carriers, the commuter aircraft that rely on going through Logan so that people can make their connections to other parts of the country or abroad.	N
I just think it is important for the FAA when they are crafting that type of policy to make sure that there is an understanding about the effects it has on small, rural areas that rely on commuter air service for any kinof air transportation.	N
Clearly what woulhave happenein the past--that is why it evokesuch a major reaction--was that the first casualty woulbe commuter aircraft, the smaller aircraft, because they carry fewer passengers.	N
But if we were to use that logic, obviously, anwe extrapolate from that, obviously either our service is going to be more expensive if we have it at all, anthat certainly woulbe the implication of that type of policy in the final analysis, because obviously the peak traffic hours are important to those of us here in Maine as well.	N
So I think that we have to design a package that does keep in minthe effects of a policy when it comes to small States that rely on commuter aircraft, because otherwise we woulnever win under that scenario anwe woulultimately face the impact of that type of policy.	N
Obviously, we are very concerneabout this peak pricing policy, anI know that the goal is to reduce delays at Logan anthat is an important objective because they do have major problems with delays.	N
But on the other hand, I want to make sure that we are not excludefrom this process to the extent that we feel the true impact of that policy.	N
On another issue, back in December 2000 the FAA issuean order regarding distribution of takeoff anlanding slots at LaGuardia ana lottery system was helto allocate the limitenumber of slots available to air carriers.	N
One carrier, for example, from our State, again a small carrier, lost most of their slots under this lottery system, in fact as a result droppethe service from Portland, Maine, to LaGuardia.	N
But again, these type of actions ultimately reverberate on the smaller communities in the final analysis, anthe underservecommunities continue to be further underservebecause of these policies.	N
So I woulhope that again when you are looking at implementing these different approaches that you woullook at this, at the impact it woulhave on smaller communities, because the lottery system dihave that effect anso ultimately the carrier dicancel its service because they lost most of their slots.	N
What in your view coulbe done to relieve congestion, at least in terms of what Congress couldo to relieve congestion at various airports?	N
Have you given that any thought at this point in order to ensure that we can take various approaches, what Congress couldo, in addition to airport construction?	N
Well, I think it woulbe important at some point when you assume this position to get your input anproviding it to this Committee anto the Congress about what you view the priorities are in terms of what we couldo now on non-air traffic control initiatives, certainly where the Congress is involved, to ensure that we can do everything we can put in place to avoidelays in the future.	N
We have seen a sharp decrease in delays compareto where we were in 1999 an2000, obviously, with the effects of September 11th anthe economic slowdown.	N
There has been a projection that there will be a billion passengers a year passing through airports by the year 2010, anthe question is will we have the type of technology aninfrastructure in place anwhat shoulCongress be doing if we are not doing it already.	N
So your assessment I think on that woulbe very important as you move aheain your responsibilities in making sure that we are fully informed.	N
One of them is actually for your speeding up of the process of confirmation, although the question is not one that you will welcome.	N
There are some holds on your nomination, as you know, anwe do not want that anit is dangerous for the American people anit is dangerous for everybody who has anything to do with the airline industry for you not to be in that position.	N
Now, the contract was negotiated, it was agreeto, it was signeoff by AFSCME, it was signeoff by the Federal Aviation Administration, it was ratifieby the union members, anthen it was stoppecolin the Office of Management anBudget.	N
It involves 2,000 people anit is not going to go away unless something is done anit potentially coulaffect your confirmation.	N
I am not one of the holders, but you can say that is playing hardball, or you can say this is getting at a basic issue because we are talking about the morale anhow people are treateanthis anthat anthe other thing--contract agreeto, you-them, or your predecessor-them, stoppeat OMB, where so many things in all administrations die, because they have special responsibilities anthey are not always the warmest of hearts that reside over there.	N
before I came to this Committee hearing, I saito another Senator in our caucus that we were going to have this hearing.	N
The Senator made a very interesting comment which resonatewith me, because I have been watching government for quite a long time.	N
I was a Governor for 8 years andinot have quite as many people working for me as you will at 50,000.	N
It always interesteme anit has interesteme a lot more since I have gotten here, in a small State a Governor, for example, to wit you, can issue an order or can do a directive or pursue something anthere is always a fairly close relationship between the State Government anthe people who work for it ana Governor.	N
There were those on this Committee that opposethe idea of aviation security going to homelansecurity.	N
I think it is a gooidea, because I think you have so much to do, you will be involvewith it anyway.	N
But the whole concept of what you call the culture of bureaucracy, the culture of non-change, the culture of, oh, Administrator Blakey is going to come anthen she is going to go.	N
Yes, she will be here for 5 years, that is unusual, but then she will go, then there will be somebody else.	N
This is like Senators who have been here for a long time say: Oh, I have been through five presidents, I have been through seven presidents, whatever it is.	N
There develops this kinof a culture of ``we are who we are anpeople may tell us what to do, but we do not listen because we do what we do.	N
They say the worlhas changed, but our equipment has not changed, our ethos has not changed, our self-esteem has not changed; we show up to work, we do the same thing.''	N
I am on the Intelligence Committee; I watch in there the most intimate animmediate matters of national security, the reluctance of people in various organizations that work on that to change the way they do business, to change their patterns of behavior, basically culture.	N
That is a big deal, people do not show up, anwhen the Administrator shows up that really means something.	N
On the other hand, FAA is changing so fast, needs to change so fast, its various functions neeto be modernizeso quickly.	N
We, for the first time, we were very lax in Congress, finally passea reauthorization bill.	N
But one of the things I think nobody can doubt is that O'Hare may not be a problem for delays in O'Hare itself, but it sure is a problem in West Virginia anevery other place that any plane out of O'Hare flies to or from.	N
Now, that does not mean that you can take air traffic control anask them to do something differently until you have the technology to allow them to either separate distances, altitude in the air, or whatever distances between planes, or finthe technology to allow planes to lanor take off more quickly, anthat they are all in place anthat they are all compatible anthey reflect themselves in the cockpit.	N
But the general question I have, this person said, anI will just be very blunt about it, that ``those FAA people, they are going to eat her alive.''	N
It is a gooanswer, anit is an important answer anyou hit it immediately anyou hit it hard.	N
The fact that you have been in the bureaucracy, so to speak, in fact does mean a great deal.	N
I think the American people have no sense of what it is that an FAA Administrator goes through, what they face, the pressures on them, that everything is real-time, instant, anfunding is always short.	N
You have the advantage that aviation is one of the most high profile issues on the national agenda right now anvery much, obviously, in terms of security.	N
Your interest is in safety, your interest is in getting people back into airplanes, your interest is in having planes take off on time, lanon time, have them do it faster, but at the same time very safely.	N
Mr. Chairman, I move that John McCain be the Chairman of the Commerce Committee for this Congress.	N
Mr. Chairman, let me recommenfor consideration, anyou can take it up with the members, but now that we've grown to 22 members, you know, in the Appropriations Committee if we waitefor opening statements for all 22, the poor witness woulnever get to testify.	N
So if we can just forego those or the Chairman or Ranking Member or whatever or if some Senator's got a particular interest, we always yielto exceptions.	N
What we try to do is convenience the entire Committee, of course, anmainly the witnesses.	N
Because as you mentioned, there are some times where it's a burning issue for a witness or of a particular interest to members of the Committee.	N
But perhaps we coulinformally adopt a general rule that we do as they do on the far more dictatorial Appropriations Committee that we restrict the opening statements to the Chairman anRanking Member, except for those who might have a particular interest in the issue.	N
Anmembers are then recognizein order of seniority going down to make comments before we take up amendments.	N
Mr. Mineta, I think it is appropriate that you be the witness before our first formal new convening of this Committee.	N
Because you as a Democrat I think are significant of the new Administration's bipartisanship anbipartisan approach to governing in this new millennium.	N
This Committee has as you know because of your previous visits here works in a bipartisan fashion as well.	N
We are pleaseto see you before the Committee again anwoullike to acknowledge any of your family members who may be here.	N
Senator Carnahan, I am tolby the staff that we have efforts under way to extenthat side of the dais so that you will not be subjecteto sitting with the press.	N
So, is there anyone who woullike to make an opening statement or comments before we move to Senator Boxer anCongressman Dreier?	N
When I was the Vice Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Norm Mineta was the Chairman of the Public Works Committee.	N
AnI think that his experience in transportation is not only welcome, but it absolutely necessary.	N
Because I think our transportation system in our country is under the most trial that it has been in a number of years.	N
Certainly in the aviation sector, I want to say I am very concerneabout this new performance baseorganization for the FAA.	N
I hope that we will be able to monitor it closely anwork out kinks if we finthem quickly.	N
I secondly hope that we will adopt a policy of an intermodal system that works for our country.	N
We are in vast neeof highway resources, especially in my State of Texas, that has the highest number of highway miles anthe longest foreign border of any State in our country.	N
Mr. Chairman, as you have noted, Mr. Mineta is an American success story anI ask that my statement be made part of the record.	D
I will be introducing a bill shortly to try to truncate the procedure by which runways, additional capacity at our airports are put in place.	N
AnI think we have got to really become aggressive in this legislation session to deal with that.	N
Mr. Chairman, I am just so delighteto be a member of your Committee, Senator Hollings anyou, Mr. Chairman are great leaders on the issues that the Committee focuses on.	N
Anthe reason I can be brief is because know that our frienNorm Mineta is no stranger to you.	D
I was here introducing him when he was nominateto be the Commerce Secretary by President Clinton.	D
I woullike to ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein's statement be insertein the recorat this time 	N
Briefly, I want to tell you that Norm Mineta representethe Silicon Valley in the House of Representatives for 21 years anI was happy to serve with him for 10 of those.	D
So he already is very familiar with the responsibilities of the Department of Transportation antransportation policy.	D
As Chairman of that Committee, he was the principle author of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.	D
Anthat landmark legislation expandetraditional highway legislation to include transit, pedestrian improvements, bike paths.	N
He has extensive knowledge about our aviation systems, as has been pointeout by Chairman McCain, from serving as the Chairman of the Aviation SubCommittee anserving on the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.	D
Since leaving the House, Mr. Mineta has serveon several transportation relateFederal commissions anadvisory panels.	D
Mr. Mineta began his political career in 1967 when he became the first Asian Pacific American member of the City Council of his home town of San Jose, California which is as you know in the heart of the Silicon Valley.	D
Just 4 years later in 1971, he was electethe Mayor of San Jose, the first Asian Pacific American mayor of a major UniteStates city.	D
While serving in the Congress, Mr. Mineta foundethe Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus anhe serveas its first chair.	D
One area where I admire Norm so much, anI know so many of you do as well, was his fight to ensure the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which officially apologizefor anaddressethe injustices endureby Japanese Americans during WorlWar II.	D
I want to say what a great honor it is for me to have joineSenators Boxer anFeinstein over the past week.	N
AnI am particularly honoreto be able to be here on behalf of my frienanformer colleague Norm Mineta.	D
We have heartalk about air safety which is something that is of great concern to every single one of us.	N
As a Southern Californian, I have to say that we have a wide range of infrastructure problems which neeto be addressed.	N
Anthat is why I believe that Norm Mineta will in this position as Secretary of Transportation do a superb job.	N
Last Saturday as we all listeneto President Bush's inaugural address, I was struck with the alliteration in which he referreto the neefor civility, compassion ancharacter ancourage.	N
Anas we listeneto the descriptions from our colleagues here of Norm Mineta, obviously, he comes to minwhen we think of all of those words.	N
AnI believe that if we look at the challenges aheain this new millennium, infrastructure, transportation issues will be key at every level.	N
I am also very concerneabout the globalization of our economy anthe fact that we are going to neeto make sure that we move goods anservices that are coming in from all over the worlgoing to anfrom.	N
AnI believe that it is essential that we focus on animprove our infrastructure so that we are able to maintain our preeminence in this global economy.	N
So I am very pleaseanprouas a Californian anas an American to wholeheartedly recommenanencourage the confirmation of our frienNorm Mineta.	D
Anwe know that you anSenator Boxer speak for all Californians as well as Americans in endorsing his new position in the Bush Cabinet.	N
Senator Stevens anI were just talking about why is it that they will not expanan airport in some parts of the country when it is clearly needed, when you must do that, anthen complain about the lack of air service anthe gridlock.	N
So we are going to have to take on some pretty powerful forces if we are going to reverse this trenwhich your Commission deemeinexorable.	N
Anas you made reference, sooner or later, it is bounto have some effect on America's economy.	N
So I think one of our highest priorities working with Senator Hutchison, Senator Rockefeller anothers is that we address this aviation issue ansoon.	N
The American people deserve better than what they have been getting from their government.	N
Anfrankly, not just their Federal Government, but their State anlocal governments as well.	N
During the last 2 weeks of Secretary Slater's service, he awardeapproximately $20 million in Federal funding to his home State of Arkansas for various transportation projects.	D
Just last week he awarde$4.8 million in grants for Arkansas Transit Airports anrural transportation studies.	N
Frankly, I believe this action by the Secretary given the timing raises questions about the justifications for such funding as well as the motives for the last minute awards.	N
What assurance can you offer this Committee that under your leadership the awarding of discretionary funding will be basesolely on merit rather than politics or other inappropriate criteria?	D
Anthat under your watch there will not even be an appearance of personal or political favoritism in the awarding of discretionary funding?	N
Anthat is because the public demands it provide certain services that are non-economical.	N
If you haa wonderful Amtrak high speetrain between New York anMiami anit dinot have to stop in Columbus, South Carolina, Richmond, Virginia an50 other places, it woulmake money.	N
Anyou have got more experience this minute than most Secretaries of Transportation haafter their 4 years of service.	D
Yeah, if we want to leave out some of those cities animprove that roamap, we neealternative solutions.	N
Otherwise, I want to answer the Chairman's question why the communities do not builadderunways or airport facilities because they are no longer in charge.	N
You see, when I practicelaw way back, the community of Charleston, for example, went out into the county, taxethemselves in the city, built the airport, got the tower up, went to Eddie Rickenbacker at Eastern Airlines ansaican we get the service?	N
Anafter negotiations, we came up to the CAB, the Civil Aeronautics Board, anwe saihere is the service.	N
In fact, when I first got here, we hafour airlines, National, Eastern, Delta anPiedmont.	N
I hathe Vice President of U.S. Air in my office on a Wednesday, just like today, anaskeU.S. Air how much a rountrip ticket for my wife to Charleston anWashington back on Friday morning.	N
So what you have hawith money controlling the competition is 85 percent of the small anmedium sizetowns of America subsidizing those long hauls to California andown from New York to Miami anthen overseas anotherwise.	N
Anmore than anything else, if I have to go through Charlotte, U.S. Air controls 85 percent of the landings antakeoffs.	N
Anwe have got a bill in that we are looking at anwe studieit in a judicious fashion to see if we can break up those hubs anget competition back again.	N
But somehow, some way you have got to understanthe reality of the effects of pricing on the consumer.	N
I understoowhy you startechoking a little while ago reading that stuff about average prices.	N
I mean, tell whoever is over at the Department not to write that out for you to reaanymore.	N
Anwe just founout here in the past couple of years, Senator Graham, myself anothers, that there is no security.	N
But let us say less than 2 percent of the containers coming in--I have got the fourth largest container port in the UniteStates.	N
If you go to Long Beach, New York, these other big ports, less than 2 percent are even inspected.	N
Rather than sending the stuff up in flowers, they couleasily just fill up containers ansen10 in anonly one woulbe inspected.	N
We know up in New Jersey that they have got a 25 mile place where they are supposeto inspect.	N
You know now from the Cole blow up anexplosion that they coulwell fill one of those containers anblow up the Port of New York.	N
They are competing to get the cargo in, move it in fast angetting it out annot having it delayefor inspection.	N
Because I am convincemost of the drugs coming in the country are right in those containers.	N
But let us break up those hubs anget some kinof competition back in the airlines anget the communities back.	N
They are the ones that built the facilities aneverything else of that kinangot the service.	N
So the communities themselves can open up anget addeservice, afacilities there aneverything else like that anbring back real competition like we habefore this so-callederegulation.	N
I woulreminour members anfor the benefit of our new members, the practice on the Committee is to go from one side to the other by order of appearances so-	N
If there is any one place in the Administration in this perioof time that shoulbe totally anobviously bipartisan, it is your Department.	N
It is my judgment that we shoulhave some way to get a certificate of need--if we can devise the process to get it.	N
If the neeis there, we will have a constraineperioof review anlimitereview as far as the courts are concerned.	N
More than 70 percent of our people within the State who travel from point-to-point go by air.	N
Anwhen we look at it--we have the Commissions looking at it now, particularly NIOSH, National Institute of Occupation anSafety anHealth.	N
At Dutch Harbor, the No. 1 fish port in the UniteStates, the runway is 3,300 feet long anthe jets, the 737s land.	N
We are at a point now I think where unless our aviation problems are solved, we will go downhill as a state.	N
I really think that what we neeto do is finsomeway to put that concept of eliminating the delays anfinding some way to increase the capacity of aviation as the No. 1 task for you.	N
In the days when we were a territory, we useto call--no ethnic slur involved--but we useto the call the Secretary of the Interior the Great White Father.	N
AnI urge you to take a look at the role that your department has playein the past as far as our State anHawaii.	N
What I woulreally like for you to do is to see if you can get together a group of task forces that woulwork with our Aviation Subcommittee, with the Aviation Subcommittee of the House ansee if we can come up with a proposal for this new century of matching the airport capacity with the demands of the future annot just try to catch up with what has been delayein the past.	N
My only real question to you is with regarto the role that you now play in terms of transportation, beyonaviation, what is the major task that you have in the Department.	N
Mr. Secretary, recently when the U.S./Japan bilateral air agreement was signed, it was haileas a great step forward.	N
However, because of capacity constraints, we finthat although our air carriers have the authority to provide service, no slots are available at Narita.	N
Someone suggestethat we shoulmake it an international policy objective to call upon the Japanese to open up Haneta to our air carriers.	N
Otherwise, it is just a paper agreement which is not helping the balance of payment or balance of trade.	N
At least in the interim, if they woulopen up Haneta, it woulaccommodate all carriers according to the contract anagreement.	N
But I woullike to ask you what actions DOT can anwill take, not only to look at the over scheduling of airlines at peak times at airports which cause delays even in the best of weather conditions, but also the general over scheduling of airlines period.	N
I understanthat they are trying use the equipment as efficiently as they can, but the number of delays from having to fix parts on an airplane anthe over scheduling at peak times I think must be addressed.	N
I think that what we ought to be able to do is to try to shorten that perioof time in order to have that additional capacity annot try to suppress on the demanside.	N
Because to me as we try to deal with airport delays by acting on the demanside, I think that woulreally be the wrong way to go.	N
I think you are certainly on the right track for trying to compact those anhave them run at the same time.	N
But I hope you will use the creativity anthe knowledge that you have to continue to look for other ways to determine how much is really needein that area, sort of a bottom up review of the regulatory morass that we have in that area.	N
But I have to tell you I am concerneabout the boarthat has been appointeto run the ATO.	N
AnI respect those who I know, but I think some of the backgrounds of the people on that boarare not the technical backgrounds with the aviation experience that I think we neeif we are going to have that very high area of responsibility for our air traffic control system rest in that board.	N
Anwill there be a system in which we can monitor, very carefully, the progress that is being made?	N
Mr. Secretary, let me seconSenator Hollings' judgment about the amount of experience that you bring to this.	D
Anit was a delight to sit with you in my office anI thank you for the time to examine some of these issues.	N
Obviously, you have just come into this with so much more backgrounanunderstanding which will allow you to I think get off to a terrific start anwe are all grateful for that.	D
If I couljust--because we hatime to talk anyou have answerea number of the key questions, I want to flag a few things for the recorif I can quickly.	N
I listeneto Senator Hutchison talk about the needs, the infrastructure needs, anevery comment thus far has underscorethe degree to which we are behinthe curve in terms of our capacity.	N
AnI think that we are headefor an enormous collision here in the Congress at the current rate, given the President's adherence to the campaign.	N
If you look at the numbers, CVO will come out in a couple of weeks with the 10 year estimates on surplus.	N
When you finish with the Medicare set aside, Social Security, inviolate interest payments, you are down to about a $2.2 billion available sum of money available for tax cut aneverything else.	N
When you finish with inflation anwith population growth anwith the amount of money that the military is going to come in anask for which we all understanis very significant, you may be looking at this.	N
Anthere are going to be enormous pressures, not just within this Committee, but within all kinds of Committees here.	N
Despite the fact that there were some 2,600 rescues, 10,000--I mean, an extraordinary amount of increase in their requirements for drug enforcement, fishing enforcement, not to mention the increases in recreational boating another things we look to them for.	N
AnI just want to say that in point of fact, only if you include depreciation ancapital expenses can you come up with a notion that somehow they are not doing a better job.	N
Actual operating expenses in fact the losses have decreasebecause there has been an increase in capital stock investment, increase in ridership, the Acela train now coming on anso forth.	N
We, it seems to me, are sort of lockeinto an absence of common sense here with respect to some of these problems.	N
I have prepareto join with Senator Wyden anothers in reintroducing the passengers' bill of rights.	N
But it seems to me that it is only by creating sort of a shake up to the workings of the marketplace that were actually going to get people to recognize some realities.	N
Now, the Chairman has suggestea number of different ways we can approach that, but nobody has done anything.	N
Because we have allowethe airlines to increase volume andeliver a terrible service ancreate these pockets of monopoly which are not competitive, where they make up for the subsidy to attract more people than they really ought to be attracting in other markets, we deprive other entities of an intermodal transportation system from being competitive according to market forces.	N
If prices in fact reflectethe cost of tickets for moving those numbers of people in anout of those places at peak times, more people might say, oops.	N
Amtrak cannot possibly be judgeproperly if it is not given the capital grants ancapital expense investment capacity to be able to attract the ridership to take people from point A to point B on time ancomfortably in a way that is competitive andecent.	N
You know, we can manage 5,000 aircraft in the air at one time in congesteair space over Iraq without a collision, but we are not able to provide emergency relief through all of our technology to our own air system.	N
These are contradictions that I think most of our citizens are simply tireof putting up with.	N
AnI think all of us here are really anxious to work with you with a realistic approach to all of this.	N
But unless we are prepareto invest, Mr. Secretary, in an intermodal system angive local communities the flexibility not to be lockeinto building a highway when they do not want to or to having to increase automobile traffic when that is not their first choice, but rather being able to keep the spirit of what we diboth in ISTEA anTEA-21, I think we are going to have a very difficult time responding.	N
AnI simply wanteto lay that out to you that we are really in neeof a measure of honesty, a lot of harchoices are<plus-minus> put on the table anall of us neeto step back from some of the easy political choice here anrecognize that the long-term investment needs of this country are being deferreandeferreandeferred.	N
I finally might athe lost of productivity--the loss of productivity for the hours of our businesspeople spent, obviously, digitalization anPalms anthe capacity to e-mail from your seat has alleviatesome of that.	N
But nevertheless, the loss of face time, the amount of--numbers of goods anproducts that do not move expeditiously is costing this country literally billions of dollars ancountless percentage points in productivity.	N
Secretary Mineta, we very much enjoyelistening to your remarks anyour understanding of the importance of intermodalism anhow all passengers ancargo work together.	N
In my experience as Governor, anI think all of us recognize here, that Federal transportation policy, especially insofar as roads are concerned, are as much environmental policy as they are transportation policy.	N
Concepts such as the Public Private Transportation Act which we passein Virginia another states are emulating the matter.	N
I am just reading here on the Coal Fields Expressway which will link West Virginia, Kentucky anSouthwest Virginia together.	N
On Federal environmental studies needeon this expressway's impact on the Indiana brown bat ana small worlPagonia, two endangerespecies, coultake up to a year to complete State transportation officials stated.	N
Now, this is consistent with Senator Hutchison's concern anwhat you are saying having these studies work concurrently.	N
A private company, Brown & Root anRepoca, are the ones who will be using this private/public transportation method.	N
But if you do not run these studies concurrently, that just delays this particular roaproject in Far South, West Virginia which has high unemployment.	N
I look forwarto working with you on the thircrossing anHampton Roads which will be important for our port which has nearly doubleits containerizecargo capacity.	N
The Wilson Bridge, the tech way with the new crossing of the Potomac, high speerail is generally being completefrom Boston to D.C.	N
AnI do think, Senator Hollings, it ought to stop in Richmonas well as Raleigh, Charlotte, Greenville, on down to Atlanta.	N
AnI woullike to ask you do you favor competitive bidding on Federal projects, open competitive bidding on Federal transportation projects?	N
On the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, our State of Virginia anGovernor Gilmore have been trying to make sure that we have full open bidding on that contract.	N
The State of Marylandisagrees with the Commonwealth of Virginia on that in this compact.	N
Anthey want to have what are callethese PLAs which have a great deal of concern that inhibits the ability of non-union contractors to do that work.	N
So that we coulhave full anfair open competition for that project anthereby not subjecting the taxpayers Federal or either states from overruns or addecosts from having lessenecompetition in that bidding.	N
This is a project labor agreement which means that there is an agreement with the State of Maryland, but there is a compact for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge between Virginia, Maryland, anthe District, the Federal Government promisewell over $1.5 billion on this.	N
We in Virginia do not care to be hit with cost overruns because from studies usually if you only allow union contractors to work, that means that non-union folks cannot even compete for it or have to increase their wage scales.	N
So as I understanit, at the last moment, the State of Maryland, Governor Glendenning, anthe State of Marylanaskefor Federal approval of that.	N
AnI hope you will review it in the concept of making sure we keep that project in line as far as costs are concerned.	N
AnI think we neeto use technology to think outside the box or outside the CPU as far as transportation matters are concerned.	N
AnPresident Clinton last spring haan opportunity to sign an Executive Order on Federal workforce transportation, but he strippeaway a provision to expanopportunities for Federal workers to telecommute from home.	N
I think telecommuting or teleworking is just a great idea to improve our quality of life, reduce commute times as well as improve air quality where people wherever possible anpractical coulwork at home a few days out of the week using a computer.	N
Now, the Federal workers in this area, as you well know, the Federal Government is the largest employer in the metro D.C. area.	N
So I think that some of the studies, anCongressman Wolfe on the House side has workeon this extensively.	N
Some studies estimate as many as 470,000 workers coultelework in the Washington, D.C. area, including 270,000 Federal employees.	N
Now, if all of them were to telecommute, that wouleliminate 658,000 vehicle trips anmore than 3.6 million vehicle miles.	N
So I woulask you to urge President Bush to sign such an Executive Order to expanteleworking opportunities for Federal employees in the Washington area.	N
AnI woulalso ask you about maybe allowing at least within your agency within the Department of Transportation, an agency that has statein its analysis of the original telework Executive Order proposal, ``properly deployed, telecommuting can be a valuable, simple, expedient ancommon sense addition to the remediation of growing traffic congestion.	N
So I woulask you to look at what was stateby the previous administration's Secretary of Transportation, seemingly very favorable to it, at least doing it within your agency anhopefully encouraging President Bush to do it for all Federal employees.	N
AnI know that you are not, I do not think, at this time prepareto answer all of them because you neeto obviously confer with the President anothers in the Cabinet.	N
So what I woullike to do with the time that I have is run through these anperhaps at the ensave a little time so that you can give maybe a general response.	N
Let me say first that when Amtrak is brought up, many times the fight is made for Amtrak by the folks in the Eastern part of the country.	N
AnI want to say that it may be a little known fact, anmaybe it is my fault for not focusing on it, but now that I am on this Committee, I will more focus on it, that we have almost seven million passengers, Mr. Chairman anSenator Hollings, in the year 2000 who rode on Amtrak.	N
Anif I just list the cities that are involved, you can see why it is so important to us: San Jose, I mentionefirst, Oakland, Sacramento, Auburn, the Pacific surf liner that goes up the coast, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego.	N
I woulthink in this century looking ahead, Mr. Chairman, in this global economy, one of the most important things many of us believe is moving people anmoving cargo anmoving our mail angetting things done.	N
AnI think if we take a slap at Amtrak anwe do not get behinit, I do not think we can live up to being a worleconomic leader.	N
Anso I want to ask you in writing if you coulanswer your general feelings about Amtrak.	N
But going through all the problems we are in our State with electricity which I will not go into, very, very complicated, deregulation, that no one seemeto be preparefor its ramifications anso on.	N
AnI look at the SUVs anI see that they are treatelike light trucks at 20.7 miles per gallon compareto 27.5 miles per gallon for cars.	N
If we were just to make that one change, Mr. Mineta, we woulsave a million barrels of oil every single day.	N
Anwe woulnot have to debate drilling anANWR another things because we coulcome in with all of that saveenergy.	N
But every year, we have to look at the fact that 40,000 people are killeon our nation's highways.	N
Anso I think the whole issue of traffic safety is one I want to get your philosophy on anyour thoughts.	N
AnI know that lots of members of this Committee, the Chairman, have taken great leadership on that.	N
We see that the SUVs, nearly two-thirds of deaths in SUVs are as a result of rollover accidents versus 22 percent in passenger cars.	N
Anthere is a rollover standard, but it was baseon static measurement, not a dynamic test.	N
So I am interestein your view whether you wouluse the best science to develop an accurate rollover standard.	N
Ansince your questions were so encompassing anso illuminating, I woulmove at this time in order that after the vote at 11:30, we coulhave the Senate move to confirm Norm Mineta as Secretary of the Department of Transportation, that I woulask for--I woulmove that we move his nomination at this time, continue with the questioning until every Member has been able to complete their question.	N
Then we will, as soon as we break, Mr. Mineta, we will inform the majority leader that we have voted.	N
Now we will inform him so that when we go for a vote at 11:30, the recordevote as I understanthe schedule.	N
I am still getting useto not only this Committee, but I think I founthe men's room a couple of times arounhere.	N
Obviously, being from a State like Nevada, we have a little bit of Federal lanin our state.	N
Anthere is very important public lands highway funding that is controlleobviously by the Congress anby you.	N
It is supposeto be, from what I understand, the funding is supposeto be relative to the amount of public lands that you have in your state.	N
But despite this Congressional direction, we have an analysis that shows that Alaska, California, which shoulbe a concern to you anto others from your state, Idaho anNevada have been particularly disadvantageto a total of about close to $80 million since TEA-21 became effective.	N
As an example, for instance, Washington, D.C. receive$4.4 million in fiscal year 2001, comparewith Nevada at $439,000.	N
Kentucky with only one million acres of Federal lanreceive$2.3 million in fiscal year 2001.	N
Basically, this is the point I just wanteto raise--anI woullike you to look into it.	N
AnI do not expect obviously an answer today, but just wanteto raise this as a concern.	N
That if a funis set up for a particular purpose, it woulseem to me that it is only fair that it be usefor that particular purpose.	N
This is true especially in a lot of the western states where we have huge tracks of Federal lananwe have a lot of roads, anincreasingly, we cannot use that lanbecause of regulations anvarious things.	N
Anwe cannot gain revenue from those lands because property taxes are necessary to maintain those roads.	N
It is becoming more anmore of a burden on states like the States of Nevada anCalifornia.	N
Anso I woulask you to look into the funding formulas for that anmaybe we can work together on possibly making some adjustments in the future.	N
I do not think that has ever been done by somebody in the Department of Transportation in a confirmation hearing before.	N
There are about four railroads that carry 95 percent of the products, bulk goods, et cetera in the nation.	N
Anfrom that, they make 94 percent of the profits of all goods that are moveby rail in this nation.	N
Traditionally, Secretaries of Transportation have lookeupon trucking firms, barges, airlines, railroads, et cetera, as the area of focus for the Department.	N
Anthey have paifar less attention with respect to those who put on the railroads, the consumers, the grain folks, coal folks, steel folks, chemical folks.	N
We all know that the Staggers Act saithat 80 percent of all rails woulbe deregulated, but 20 percent woulnot.	N
Anthose 20 percent woulbe those that haa single--haall the competition to themselves.	N
The Service Transportation Board, the STB, is unknown by most members of our society anby many Members of Congress, what it stands for, much less what it does.	N
But bottlenecks, there are a number of us on this Committee who are very concerneabout that particular word.	N
Anthe willingness of those very few, 50 when I came here 17 years ago, four today, of Class A railroads, that they will not share or allow each other to get into competition.	N
Now, railroads alone are not subject to the same antitrust laws as all the other forms of transportation.	N
But I woullike to know that you are going to symbolize by the use of the worbottlenecks that you are going to be thinking about enuse consumers anpeople who live andie by the railroads, anparticularly those railroads that have a single line into their place of business.	N
Anit is an interesting subject because it effects every single person in the UniteStates of America, virtually every single one.	N
Anyet it is an issue I have been working on for 17 years anhave very little to show for it.	N
But it is an extraordinary problem, ansomehow it has bypassethe Congress' focus anthe American people.	N
You get air congestion anit is on the front page of USA Today everyday during the summer when people are traveling.	N
This problem is year round, constant angets almost no attention, including from previous Secretaries of Transportation.	N
Let me make one little plug for something callethe small community air service development program.	N
It has everything to do with what Senator Hollings anI are talking about anthat is the possibility, anhope, of small communities being able to develop innovative approaches to improve access into their airports.	N
I happen to be one that supports the U.S. Airway-UniteMerger, American just announceits involvement with that merger.	N
Anthat is to put regional jets into markets within a perioof 2 years after the merger is approved, insteaof all the turbo props--which can really hurt large sections of rural communities--well, where U.S. Airway commuter cover, impacting economic development possibilities.	N
The reason I say that is that unless we can work these problems out so that there are regional jets as well as hubs anspokes, rural America will begin to disappear even more quickly than it is.	N
That aviation is now more important than highways in terms of business location decisions anwill grow more so.	N
Two question areas that I want to ask you about, aircraft manufacturing antrucking, two areas.	N
We have got Cessna, Raytheon, Boeing, Emartia, all have manufacturing facilities there, aircraft.	N
A key concern that they have in working with the Department of Transportation is the approval process, the certification process, for new products that they bring out.	N
I think you woulagree that the aviation safety is a major priority for the Department of Transportation.	N
Fortunately, manufacturers have developenumerous new products that coulleato major safety improvements in both commercial angeneral aviation.	N
However, they must go through an often byzantine FAA certification process for these new products.	N
I want to draw your attention to that anthen ask if you woulmake streamlining the FAA certification process a priority so that safer anmore efficient products coulbe brought to market.	N
But if that process can be revieweanlookeat for streamlining, I think the same is going to be important as we look at expanding capacity at our airports, particularly in environmental streamlining.	N
I think we do not change the requirements, but if you can streamline the process so it can be truncated, what we are looking at in the legislative approach.	N
We have hasome discussion on that earlier anthe hours of service issue was raiseby Senator Boxer.	N
In my state, we move many of our products to market trucking, railroads, aircraft, but also trucking.	N
I think there is a safety issue that shoulbe revieweanshoulbe carefully considered.	N
But also the impact, particularly in rural areas, of this hours of service requirement can have a very adverse economic impact annot a positive safety impact.	N
AnI have haa number of groups, companies, independent truckers, a number of people contact me.	N
I woulhope you woullook at that anits impact I think actually coulbe substantially different, urban versus rural or long distances of trucking.	N
Because particularly if you are having to work out in a rural area anyou are going say driving a drilling rig, driving something that then you work on, the way it is currently designecan have an adverse impact, particularly in rural areas.	N
I remember our long relationship that we hain the House of Representatives anthe 14 years that I spent over on the other side anyour enthusiastic support for my candidacy for the Senate which I never quite fully understoountil I realizethat when I left, you became Chairman over there.	N
I think that when you have hathe experience anthe backgrounanthe training that you have, as well as to serve in the Congress anto go out into the private sector anbeing willing to come back into government service is truly a really big sacrifice on your part.	D
AnI think all of us are going to be much better for your willingness to serve in that capacity.	D
Let me deal with some questions along the lines I think that my frienSenator Rockefeller was talking about.	N
It seems to me that in order to have competition which you spoke of, you have to have competitors in order to compete.	N
AnI know a number of others are getting very concerneabout the consolidation of all of the industries in this country that we are commanding to be competitive.	N
What kinof concern is going to be expresseabout this problem of overall consolidation?	N
We all know that it is not your Department's responsibility to approve or disapprove of the mergers, but you have to run the Department that these people play in.	N
Anif all of a sudden you turn around, you've got one railroaanone airline anwe do not have any competitors, you are not going to be able to do your job.	N
AnI think with your backgrounanexperience anknowledge in these areas, you have to be a voice if you will, within this Administration to talk about competition anhow important it is.	D
That is going to be one that is going to meet the needs of the American public, particularly in the area of transportation.	N
Whether it is communication, transportation, aviation, railroads, oil angas, energy production.	N
The Senate in the last Congress passeby unanimous vote--Senator McCain ana number of Senators on this Committee workevery harto compromise anget a natural gas pipeline bill out.	N
The Department has recently issuea final rule on pipeline safety for petroleum pipelines for liquipipelines.	N
Anit is my understanding that the Office of Pipeline Safety is preparing to issue a proposerulemaking on natural gas pipelines.	N
I mean, what is goofor oil pipelines does not necessarily fit the mode for natural gas pipelines.	N
The whole concept of running a so-callepig through an oil pipeline to detect any leaks is easy.	N
But you cannot do that with natural gas pipelines because they bend, they curve anit just does not work.	N
So I guess my recommendation to you is that to make sure when these rules come up--I hope Congress does this ourselves angives you some guidance.	N
But make sure that the Department officials understanthe major difference anthat you have to have options available to get the job done.	N
I mean, my State anmany of the members arounhere are very dependent anat the same time very concerneabout the supplemental requests that the Coast Guarseems to live on.	N
Right now our Coast Guaris in the far off Islands of the Galapagos to try to help clean up a major environmental spill.	N
They are calleon a regular basis to do this off our coast lines in addition to drug interdiction anmilitary law type enforcement activities.	N
AnI woulhope that you woulbe supportive of that supplemental as it works its way trough the Congress including the integratedeep water system project where we are trying to modernize all these fleet of ships.	N
I mean, some of them are really antiques out there that we have given the Coast Guarmore anmore responsibility anless anless equipment to do it.	N
So this is a big item under the Department of Transportation anit shoulbe given a great deal of support.	N
AnSenator Breaux, it is our intention, unless there is objection, to put the pipeline safety bill back on the first markup.	N
AnI want to thank you anSenator Hutchison anSenator Murray anformer Senator Slade Gorton on this issue.	N
Anit is very unfortunate that we dinot pass that bill through the Congress in the last session.	N
I think we are going to see an increaseuse of natural gas over time rather than a decrease.	N
It dinot take me more than 2 or 3 minutes to determine that you haencyclopedic knowledge about transportation in this country.	N
After your appointment, it was widely reportein the Chicago area newspapers that the first question then President-	N
elect, now President Bush, askeyou was what do you think about the neefor a thirairport in Chicago.	N
As a former colleague from the House of Representatives I certainly can attest to not only your ability, but your knowledge on so many of the transportation issues because of your position in the House.	N
I am just delightethat you are willing to accept this position within this Administration.	N
I first want to address the issue of airline service, particularly to small- anmedium-sizecommunities.	N
AnI think one of your most difficult challenges will be how to address under servecommunities in this country.	N
Anin particular, Senator Dorgan anI haaskefor a report several years ago on the impact of deregulation on smaller communities anas one who represents Maine.	N
In addition, recently we saw the lottery of slots at LaGuardia to reduce the congestion at that airport.	N
But at the same time that we are trying to factor in anintegrate into our aviation system regional jets.	N
One carrier was intending to provide regional jet service from Portland, Maine, to LaGuardia, but those slots were lost, even though there was an agreement with the FAA to allow those slots to be available for regional jet service between our State anLaGuardia.	N
So, if we are trying to encourage the incorporation of regional jets animproveair service to smaller communities across the country anyet we are having this enormous congestion at airports, small communities stanto lose first.	N
So immediately, we lost service from our largest community in Maine to LaGuardia on a regional jet.	N
We are not only losing service, but we are also seeing that even in terms of the type of equipment that will serve our State airlines do not have the slots to provide jet service.	N
Anthis one carrier, for example, made a major investment in regional jets to serve small communities, such as is in Maine.	N
So I think that you will have to examine many of the issues regarding airline service to rural communities in the state.	N
GAO certainly reinforcethat notion from the standpoint that many communities have benefited, but many communities anstates have not benefitefrom deregulation.	N
Because I do think that we have to incorporate rural states as a priority in our aviation system.	N
We will never be able to compete on an equal level with the more populateareas of this country.	N
Certainly in terms not only of population, but in terms of the type of aircraft that those communities are servewith.	N
Anso I hope that we fina way of incorporating smaller communities in our aviation system development andesign.	N
Because otherwise, we are going to see, I think, an erosion of the kinof economic development in our states, in our communities.	N
AnI woulurge you to give that your highest consideration as you are developing your vision of the future of the aviation system.	N
In addition, I am very concerneby the Inspector General s report concerning customer service anthe rising consumer complaints anwith passenger dissatisfaction at an all time high.	N
Anwhat can we do in the future to be able to address many of these complaints that have been persistent anconsistent?	N
I hope you will give it great consideration because it is one of the issues that obviously has concerneus here on the Committee.	N
I will look at that issue as a matter of fact as a way of incorporating maybe a policy with respect to serving those communities.	N
As I understanit, there will be a consolidation of the State director between Maine anVermont.	N
I gather you can understanthe problems associatewith the geography alone, especially in a State like Maine.	N
I am eager to work with you in the days aheain addressing some issues involving our highways anmass transit.	N
But today I woullike to draw our attention to two issues that are of paramount importance to my home state.	N
Preserving the more than 12,000 jobs anmaintaining the hub in St. Louis as well as the maintenance of space in Kansas City is also of paramount importance to us.	N
American Airlines in its proposeacquisition of TWA's assets has pledgeto keep virtually all the jobs, the hub anthe maintenance space.	N
Now, while I understananI certainly share the concerns of my colleagues that have already been expresseconcerning the consolidation in the airline industry, I believe that we must recognize that there is a fundamental difference between the American TWA transaction anthe other airline mergers that are currently being considered.	N
The primary difference with the American TWA Airlines deal is that TWA is a financially distressefirm that cannot be saveancannot be revivewithout intervention like that proposeby American Airlines.	N
Coulyou please share your views on whether this transaction is distinct from other airline mergers that are currently being considered?	N
Anas such, I am extremely interestein Boeing's ability to compete on a level playing field.	N
So it comes as no surprise that I am very concerneabout the $4 billion in European government loans that are helping to funa competing project, the Airbus A380.	N
The 1992 U.S./EU Civil Aircraft Treaty provides that government loans made on commercial terms are allowable only if the project is proven to be commercially viable.	N
If Airbus does not submit proof as Boeing has requestethat the A380 project is commercially viable, what course of action woulyou pursue in your new role as Secretary of Transportation?	N
I think it is a wonderful thing that President Bush has selecteyou to heathis Department for more than the obvious reason that you are so eminently qualifiefor it.	D
I have notein my political career that Republicans anDemocrats approachepouring cement ancutting ribbons with equal bipartisan enthusiasm.	N
Anso I think it is a wonderful thing that he has pickesuch a fine man, a Democrat, to heathis agency, this Department, so important to all of us now matter how we register politically.	N
In both the ISTEA anthe TEA-21, Congress anthe Administration have recognizethe benefits of linking lanuse planning antransportation capital investments.	N
They producebenefits like leveraging private investment, providing predictability again, responding to local needs anreducing energy consumption anair pollution.	N
As you think forwarto the reauthorization of TEA-21, do you anticipate that there will be opportunities to continue to move in this policy direction anfurther rewarcommunities for making a commitment to better lanuse planning antransportation coordination.	N
I think you are very familiar with my State as a neighbor to yours anhow committewe have been for many years now, for decades now, for lanuse planning, preserving prime farm anforest land, managing our growth in a way that reflects a higher quality of life.	D
As your neighbor to the north, we share a very important highway corridor anthat is, of course, Interstate 5.	N
There are places, choke points, on that important interstate that I think warrant your attention ansome priority.	N
One of them is at a point on I-5 that separates the city of Vancouver, Washington, from Portland, Oregon.	N
There are two lift span bridges there that create enormous amounts of congestion with the traffic on the Columbia River anthe traffic between these two cities where many Washingtonians live, but then work in Oregon.	N
I think frankly it warrants a change, an improvement, if we are to eliminate some of these choke points.	N
I am hoping that there will be an opportunity to address these kinds of specific needs with you in the National Corridor Program.	N
Anfinally, Mr. Secretary, I woulbe interestein your views on the appropriate balance between passenger anfreight mobility, whether you believe that the Department of Transportation shoulallocate more planning anresources to freight programs as well as passengers.	N
I think Senator Wyden anI woulboth welcome you back to Oregon as soon as you can come back anlook at our transportation needs.	N
How woulyou feel as a passenger if you got in a taxi ansaid, you know, I have got two destinations in mind.	N
If you or I were to get on a plane this morning, no advance purchase, anto fly to North Dakota, Bismarck, it woulbe about $1,600.	N
But if we decideto go to your home in California, no advance purchase, we couldo that for about $600, twice as far, less than half as much.	N
Or if you anI planneour trip anwe dia 3-week advance or so, we coulget a super saver, $560 to go to Bismarck, North Dakota.	N
Anwe are subsidizing the routes on the heavily traveleroutes between big cities pairs.	N
If you went into a taxicab anthey pricethat way, you woulthink the person was just daft.	N
But it is the way it is priceeveryday in this country for people who travel in Fritz Hollings' part of the country or my part of the country.	N
Now what we have is retrencheairlines that have come back into regional monopolies of sorts that are unregulated.	N
We will have three major airline carriers exacerbating the problem I have just describeto you.	N
In my state, our public service commission estimates that we are over charge$100 million by the railroads.	N
I am sure you are aware that the railroais the only industry in America that I am aware of that is not subject to the antitrust laws.	N
I have introducelegislation suggesting that any future merger proposals be subject to Justice review anantitrust laws.	N
But we have also introducein this Committee the Rail Shipper Protection Act which no one has ever accuseof speeding through this Committee.	N
In fact, it has haa minor form of incarceration I suppose in the sense that we introduce it annothing happens.	N
But a number of us on this Committee feel very strongly that we ought to do something about this.	N
Pricing opportunities, if I can just give you one additional example, allow the railroads to say that a bushel of grain that is pickeup in Iowa angoes from Iowa through North Dakota to the West Coast is actually chargeless, pays a lower rate, than a bushel of grain that goes from North Dakota to the West Coast.	N
Put a carloaof wheat on the track in Bismarck anmove it to Minneapolis, you pay $2,300.	N
Why do we pay more than twice as much for hauling a carloaof wheat about the same distance?	N
We have increasing chokeholds on the American consumer that relies--especially in states like North Dakota--relies heavily on transportation needs.	N
Anwe are paying an outrageous amount of money for it ansubsidizing those in other parts of the country every day, in every way.	N
Anmy hope is that you will say I am going to be a tiger on this issue of concentration in airlines anrails anothers.	N
Do you not sleep well because we see fewer anfewer companies anmore anmore concentration?	N
If my colleague wouljust bear with me one moment to ask woulyou be open to the suggestion of imposing the restrictions of a Justice review on future rail mergers?	N
Mr. Mineta, let me just say--anI think it will be in that report that is right next to you--there are just no plausible excuses for the airline industry's performance on passenger service.	N
For example, the Inspector General recently notethat the airlines know in a number of instances 3 or 4 hours aheaof time that there is going to be a significant delay anthey will not go out anchange the departure board.	N
There is just no explanation for not giving people timely, accurate information about their travel options.	N
AnI want you to know, both because of our friendship anthe importance of this issue to me, I am not calling for a constitutional right to fluffy pillows on airline flights.	N
Because we have got businesspeople, for example, wasting significant sums of money antime because they cannot get information, for example, even about bumping.	N
I am prepareto say that airlines ought to be able to sell a ticket if somebody knows that a flight is over booked.	N
But to keep people in the dark about their travel options the way this industry has done is unacceptable.	N
AnI so look forwarto seeing you at DOT anlooking forwarto your outstanding service.	N
I believe that there is supposeto be a report, Senator Wyden, on what the airlines have done that is supposeto be coming out, is it January?	N
May I say since I represent the world's busiest airport, Hartsfield, anthe country's most delayeimpacteairport, ansince I just votefor your confirmation, we neethat money for the fifth runway tomorrow afternoon.	N
Last year, Hartsfielhandlesome 78 million passengers anthis number is expecteto jump to an incredible 100 million passengers just at Hartsfielin 4 years.	N
As you may know, Dallas Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare anDenver International Airports, they all have five runways.	N
In 2005, with 100 million passengers expecteanwith just four runways, it is projectethat each flight at Hartsfielwill average 14 minutes of delay.	N
With five runways though, it is estimatethat Hartsfielwill be down to 5 minutes of delay per flight.	N
This decrease in delay is significant anit will benefit passengers not just in Georgia anin Hartsfield, but arounthe country it will have a ripple effect.	N
Because what seems to happen in Hartsfielhas a ripple effect all over the nation's airway system.	N
We woullove to be able to count on you anyour department to help expedite Hartsfield's critically needefifth runway anthe money for it anwoulappreciate your checking that out at your earliest opportunity.	N
You are on recoras a supporter for advance technology applications in the transportation industry.	D
As you may know, former Secretary Slater in the last 48 hours of his tenure chose to select only two projects out of the eligible seven to advance the magnetic levitation train, the Maglev deployment program competition.	N
The Atlanta to Chatanooga route actually, not just Atlanta, but from Hartsfielto Chatanooga.	N
Because even with the fifth runway, it may be that we max out so to speak Hartsfielmaybe as early as 2010.	N
If you coulcommute in effect from Hartsfielto the Chatanooga Airport, by magnetic levitation train at 220 miles an hour, I think that wouldramatically improve not only grountransportation in a massive growth corridor in the southeast, but it woultremendously facilitate relief at Hartsfield.	N
I just like to throw that plug in because it diseem to me that--anI was tolthat Atlanta ran a close third.	N
Anas a booster of that program, I woullike for you to continue to take a look at that corridor because it seems to make sense in so many ways.	N
May I just say that I hela Senate roundtable I call it on rail anon a lot of transportation issues in my state.	N
AnSecretary Slater in looking at the many transportation problems in Atlanta, Hartsfield, the interstate system, the question of commuter rail, the question of rapirail coming down through the Carolinas via Amtrak anthe magnetic levitation train, all of these issues converging in effect on metropolitan Atlanta having the longest commute of any metro area in America anthe most traffic gridlock of any area in the Southeast.	N
Secretary Slater agreeto establish a DOT task force of officials from the various transportation modes in DOT to work with our newly createGeorgia Regional Transportation Authority.	N
We now have locally a way to get a handle on all of these forms of transportation to plan them better, to integrate them better anto really move for the first time in our history to a balancetransportation system.	N
I thought it was a gooidea for the Secretary to like in effect establish a task force to deal with this problem regionally.	N
So that we wouldn't be playing off one form of transportation against the other antrying to run through six or seven different offices in DOT just to try to get together aneven have a meeting.	N
Anif it works there, you never can tell whether it might be a gooidea for other major areas.	N
Anit is going to be my pleasure anprivilege to work with you anI just cannot think of a better person to be in your position.	N
Anwe look forwarto working with you on all these issues that come before this Committee in terms of transportation.	N
Mr. Secretary the Department of Transportation has sought reauthorization of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act for the last several years without success.	N
In Houston, Texas, we haa terrible hazardous materials transporting truck accident that really endangeremany lives.	N
It is my understanding that the stumbling blocks have come primarily from dealing with exemptions for farmers ansome of the disagreements about authorization in the Department of Transportation or Department of Labor anwho handles what.	N
Will reauthorization of this act be a priority for the Department of Transportation under your leadership?	N
But, of course, aviation, we hathe terrible accident in Florida which we all remember as well.	N
Five years ago, Congress changethe definition of commercial motor vehicle to include commercial passenger vans carrying nine or more passengers.	N
Last month, the Department finally issuethe notice of proposerulemaking to apply most of the Federal Motor Carrier safety regulations to these vans when they are carrying passengers for more than 75 miles.	N
This is an important safety issue in a border State because these vans sometimes calleCamionetas operate across great distances without proper safety regulations.	N
Third, I have saithis to the last two Secretaries of Transportation anI am going to say it again.	N
I woulask that you look at all of our bilaterals anI woulhope that we woulhave a priority of fair anopen skies when you are dealing with the other countries in establishing more routes anmore potential destinations from Heathrow, China, Japan another places where we woullike to have more access.	N
Anlast, Mr. Chairman, I wouljust like to say in the earlier questioning, there has been a lot of talk about Amtrak.	N
AnI just want to say that I believe all modes of transportation have subsidies from taxpayers, capital subsidies, not operational.	N
AnI think we shoulall strive to make Amtrak self-sufficient operationally, but we shoulnot starve them anthe capital needs that they may have.	N
When we see the overcrowdeairports, the overcrowdehighways, there is just no question that we neeto keep the rail passenger capability to have an overall transportation system in our country.	N
I wouljust like to ask you if you are also of the view that that is part of our overall intermodal transportation system for our country anwill it be a priority for you to work with Amtrak.	N
Will you try to make them as efficient as they can be ango for operational subsidies presumably to be lesseneaneventually eliminated, but not walk away from the capital needs?	N
Well, I thank you for that anI agree with you that we cannot starve them with capital needs anthen expect them to be operationally sufficient.	N
But I also woulsay that unlike the other modes of transportation, if we lose the rail system, I do not think we will ever be able to regain it.	N
Because if we lose the railroatracks or they deteriorate or they no longer are going to be able to be long enough to make sense, we will not be able to buy the right of way to ever bring back rail.	N
So as we are looking at the long-term anthe growth in our country anthe growth in the economy of our country, I just woulurge you to make rail a priority as a part of that intermodal system rail will take some of the burden away from highways anaway from our airports.	N
Anif we fail to save Amtrak anthe railroads for freight, we are not ever going to be able to recapture it.	N
So I do not think it is quite the same as the other transportation modes from that standpoint.	N
I strongly recommenthat you look at the Department of Transportation Inspector General's report on Amtrak.	N
It is its continuing operating losses, something that we were assureof woulnot happen by the year 2002 when we bailethem out for the last time.	N
In 1971, when Amtrak was formein 3 years they woulnot neeany further infusion for operating costs of Federal dollars.	N
Since then, I have forgotten how many billions anhow many restructurings anhow many times we have come to Congress.	N
There have been numerous efforts to back door this Committee's authorization by sticking into appropriations bills antax bills.	N
Well, they put in $15 million for them on the agriculture appropriations bill so that they couluse GSA automobiles.	N
So I strongly recommend, Mr. Mineta, that you look at the history of Amtrak, you look where we are going anyou look at that overall passenger ship has not increasein the last 10 years.	N
AnI think you will feel that any objective observer of Amtrak will tell you what we are going to enup with.	N
We are going to enup with the northeast corridor anwe are going to enup with a far west of it.	N
Anthat there is nobody that believes that anywhere in between that you are going to have economically viable train systems running for passengers.	N
We neeto debate in the Congress antell the American people that as other countries, the Europeans anothers, we neeto continuously subsidize Amtrak forever.	N
I think we gave $3 billion the last time, three or four billion dollars the last time that they were going to become independent by some years in the future.	N
So what we neeto do on this issue is not continuously back door appropriations as they just attempteto do.	N
The Senator from Texas colleague, Senator Gramm, just blockea $10 billion infusion to them that again was done without a hearing, without any authorization, but was going to be stuck into the omnibus appropriations bill, something that is incredibly offensive to me as the Chairman of the authorizing Committee.	N
There is no one who is more respectebefore this Committee than the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation, Mr. Ken Mead.	N
I think he will paint a very different picture about the prospects of Amtrak ever being independent even from operating costs, particularly with the labor cost anobligations that they have in the future.	N
I think it is important that the tax paying citizens from my State not be asketo pay their tax dollars over an over again for a transit system which has basically disappearefrom our state.	N
AnI think that perhaps in the spirit of patriotism, they shoulsubsidize a northeast transit system anone in the far west.	N
But at least they deserve the full ancertain knowledge of what is going to be expecteof them.	N
Since 1971, the promises made about Amtrak consistently have not come to fruition anthat is a matter of recorwhich by the way I will provide for the record.	N
Anat least the American people deserve honest anforthright evaluation of how much it is going to cost them in the future.	N
Anagain, I woulask you to talk to people who do not have a vesteinterest in Amtrak, people who are observers anexperts on national transit systems.	N
That we are going to have to subsidize not just their capital expenses, but their operating expenses for the foreseeable future.	N
Mr. Chairman let me also tell you how exciteI am about the opportunity to serve on this very important Committee with you as Chairman.	N
Well, we have a situation now, for example, where U.S. Air flies out of Baltimore through Charlotte to New Orleans anthe fare is about $200, two hundreansome odollars.	N
If you get on that same airplane in Charlotte anfly to New Orleans--in other words, you make half the trip--it is $800 or $900.	N
AnI think that is the direct result of U.S. Air having to compete with Southwest Airlines in Baltimore.	N
I guess all I am asking is I hope you will help work with me to finsome creative ways to enhance competition if we possibly can.	D
I am happy to tell you that the vote on the floor is completeanby a very narrow margin, 100 to nothing, you were confirmed.	N
AnI hope we can fintime off the floor to proceed, anI hope that we can move them through the entire Senate.	N
I think all of them bring a great deal to commenthem for public service, anI am prouto support them.	D
In at least one of the circumstances today, a Democratic seat on the Federal Communications Commission, which is to be filleby a recommendation of the Minority Leader, was offereto the White House, now nearly 2 years ago.	N
Anthat was not sent down to the Congress, deliberately so, showing, in my judgment, an arrogance ana partisanship that is very unusual.	N
Anmy profounhope is that, with respect to nominees that are both Republican-designateseats anDemocratic-designateseats in these key agencies, that we'll be able to work together in the future annot have this sort of nonsense happen.	N
Anwhile I am pleasethat we are finally going to see progress on it today, I must make the comment that those who engineerethis at the White House, in my judgment, dino real service to public service as a result of their behavior.	N
The folks who are going on the CPB, we'll be watching you anwhat you're doing over there in public broadcasting.	N
AnMr. Adelstein, of course--very supportive of his nomination anhis confirmation back to the FCC.	N
He's been a tremendous help to all of us who have been tackling the rural issues in communications anuniversal service anthose kinof issues, anwe appreciate your support anworking with us.	D
We've still got some challenges aheawith universal service, and, of course, the e-rates, anthe rural areas still are--anthe buildout of broadbanis still of concern to most of us.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing, even at, hopefully, the last two or 3 days of this session.	N
I want to say to Mr. Adelstein, in particular, I appreciate the fact that your papers have been processeanthat you're here this morning.	N
I have participated, over the years, in a little harassment of this gentleman, but my doubts have been absolved.	N
AnI've regrettethat he hato be treatethe way he has been in the process of being renominated.	N
I think he's thoughtful ana goomember, anI think he deserves to be reconfirmed, anI'll be supportive of that in every way I can be, as I have been in the past, anI think you know that.	D
I have workeassiduously with people in public broadcasting in my state anwith the CPB, because I believe that there were real problems that coulbe addresseinternally by having goomen anwomen on the Boarantrying to carefully anslowly anthoughtfully anappropriately change the mindset, the bias, the negativity, the overall attitude of, you know, the entities you're responsible for.	N
I'm getting real tireof having people crawl on my case everywhere I go about the continueattitude anarrogance anbias of NPR.	N
Now, I'm going to have to go to another meeting, but I'like to just lay the question out.	N
But, I mean, the tears anthe crying anthe weeping angnashing of teeth the day after the election just almost made me gag.	N
Anso--you know, but the Public Telecommunications Act of 1992, under Section 19, says that there must be strict adherence to objectivity anbalance in all programs, or a series of programs, of a controversial nature.	N
I'm not saying take one particular point of view, or the other, but there are still huge problems out in the real world.	N
I'like to mention, I dimeet with the CPB nominees prior to the hearing, anI warnethem that perhaps they might be addressing some issues of some controversy concerning both CPB anNPR, anI--look, I think those are legitimate questions.	N
I think that when the taxpayers' dollars are involved, clearly we have an additional obligation than we do to any network or independent radio or television station, anI--so I think your points are well made.	N
It wasn't clear to me whether Senator Lott was alleging that it was too conservative or too liberal.	N
I guess the guy out there that runs the Historical Society pickeup his history book from a seventh-grade student, thumbing through it, they haa full page on Marilyn Monroe, but a quarter page on George Washington.	N
We are pleaseto have with us this morning Senator Tim Johnson, who woullike to make some remarks about the nominee.	N
And, also, I know that Senator Allen was here earlier, anhe wanteto, of course, welcome our nominees, as well.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this important hearing to consider nominations, including the renomination of Jonathan Adelstein to continue to serve as a member of the Federal Communications Commission.	N
Senator Daschle worketirelessly to ensure that as the first FCC Commissioner from South Dakota anthe entire upper Midwest, I coulcontinue to help ensure that all consumers, including those in Rural America, remain connected.	D
In that effort, a bipartisan chorus of support from our state has joinehim, anI am grateful to Governor Mike Rounds, PUC Chairman Bob Sahr, anto many others for their support.	N
Growing up a fourth-generation South Dakotan, with long winters anpeople scattereover large distances, I learnethe value of all of us staying connected, to each other anto the rest of the country.	N
That experience drives me to work harto fulfill the Communications Act's promise for innovative communications technologies anservices that are widely available to everyone in this country.	N
These goals become even more imperative as communications takes an ever more prominent role in our personal lives anin our global economic competitiveness.	N
With advances in technology antoday's security environment, I will also continue to put the communications needs of our public safety annational security communities at the forefront.	N
The telecommunications industry is at a crossroads, driven by the rise of broadbananits revolutionary implications.	N
From telecommuting, to distance learning, to high definition video, to telemedicine, broadbanbreaks through geographic barriers antransforms communities.	N
We must continue to encourage broadbandeployment by increasing incentives for investment anpromoting competition.	N
We can do both with a policy framework that is flexible ankeeps pace with rapitechnological changes.	N
To promote these benefits for everyone in this country, I have focuseon improving spectrum management, modernizing universal service, anprotecting diversity, competition, anlocalism in our media.	N
I have set out an approach I call a ``Framework for Innovation'' that establishes grounrules for issues like interference, while, to the greatest extent possible, allowing innovation in the marketplace to drive the development of spectrum-	N
My goal is to maximize the communications aninformation that flow over the nation's airwaves.	N
We have achieveremarkable results, on a bipartisan basis, by improving our spectrum management policy.	N
The marketplace has respondewith an explosion of new opportunities for consumers, like wi-fi annew licensewireless broadbanservices.	N
Our entire country gains economic, social, ancivic benefits from being connecteto a seamless ``network of networks.''	N
Increasingly, voice, video, andata will flow to homes anbusinesses over broadbanplatforms.	N
In this new world, we must promote a comprehensive rollout to all Americans, including those from rural, insular, another high-	N
cost areas, Native Americans another minorities, people with disabilities, non-English speakers, anlow-income consumers.	N
As for the media, I have never forgotten that the airwaves belong to the American people, anthat it is critical to preserve their access to what the Supreme Court has callethe ``uninhibitemarketplace of ideas.''	N
The FCC shoulcontinue to promote the priorities that have always formethe basis of our public interest policy as envisioneby Congress: diversity, competition anlocalism.	N
Congress has chargethe Commission with ensuring that the American public stays well-connecteanwell-protected.	N
If confirmed, I will continue to work with each of you to implement these Congressional imperatives.	N
Senator Daschle also chargeme with helping to develop a comprehensive congressional technology agenda which Senator Daschle anRepresentative Dick Gephardt unveilelive on the Internet in April 2001.	N
It containea detaileseries of proposals to spur innovation, productivity, economic growth anjob creation.	N
This effort requireextensive consultation with each of the many Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over technology issues anthe many Members of Congress with an interest in these issues.	N
This exercise helpeme establish a broavision for promoting U.S. technological development in which the FCC, along with many other Federal agencies, plays an important role.	N
I have also workewith Senator Daschle on initiatives to promote efficient spectrum management, improve the availability of local-to-	N
local television service to all regions of the U.S., anto establish the validity of electronic signatures annumerous of other telecommunications initiatives.	N
As Senator Daschle's leading banking anfinancial services advisor, I have also gainea soliunderstanding of the operations anstructure of the capital markets, which remain crucial in the financing andevelopment of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure overseen by the FCC.	N
For example, I workeon every aspect of the landmark legislation to revamp the financial services industry, the Gramm-Leach-	N
This experience provideme with great perspective on the latest developments in a fielwhich plays a key role in the future of the telecommunications industry.	N
Moreover, I have participatein the multi-year effort to enact bankruptcy reform, the commercial aspects of which are unfortunately playing an increasingly prominent role in the structuring of the telecommunications industry.	N
In my previous staff position for the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I undertook a number of in-depth investigations anorganizea number of hearings, many of which leto changes in Federal law or reforms of executive agency practices anorganizational structures.	N
This experience in exploring the depths of complex issues, anlearning how to conduct Federal investigations anorganize fact-finding hearings will help me, if confirmed, to evaluate the complex fielof telecommunications.	N
Moreover, this oversight experience providevaluable insight into the management of large ancomplex Federal agencies anhow to address bureaucratic problems that can have an adverse effect on the public which relies on those agencies.	N
In this position, I also learnefirst-hanthe importance of affordable telecommunications services to senior citizens antheir families.	N
I serveas the primary advisor to Senators Pryor anRiegle on some of the largest programs in the Federal budget which fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee on which they served.	N
This responsibility rapidly developemy ability to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal programs, initiate specific proposals for improving them anforge a bipartisan consensus in order to get changes enacteor otherwise approveby Federal agencies.	N
This experience woulaime, if confirmed, in confronting the many challenges to the efficient functioning of the FCC.	N
My undergraduate angraduate education focuseon how American history, political science, economics anpublic policy analysis coulbe employeto improve the functioning of government.	N
My political science studies at Stanford, followeby my studies there to attain a Masters in history, helpeme to better understanthe context in which government decisions were being made.	N
I furtheremy studies at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where I gainevaluable lessons in economics, statistics anpublic policy analysis.	N
In sum, I have hathe privilege of studying anserving in capacities that have providea unique level of experience, exposure aneducation about Federal Government processes, including those involving telecommunications policy.	N
I have dedicatemy career to public service in the UniteStates Senate, working for some of its finest members.	N
I can imagine no greater training grounto prepare an individual for the enormous responsibility of implementing the complex anoften disputetelecommunications laws enacteby Congress.	N
Public service has affordeme the opportunity to make some concrete contributions to what I, anthe members I served, considereto be in the public interest.	N
This country anmy home state of South Dakota have given so much to me anmy family that no amount of giving back in the form of public service can ever repay the gratitude I feel.	N
My mother's family founsafe haven here from the holocaust as they escapeNazi-occupiePoland.	N
My father's family founsafe haven here from the pogroms in Russia arounthe turn of the century.	N
My great-grandmother homesteadenear the Badlands of South Dakota, anmy grandfather went on from there to founa business that became one of the largest employers in the state.	N
Now, baseon the extraordinary opportunities aneducation I have been affordein the Senate anat fine educational institutions, I woullike to use my experience to promote the public interest as envisioneby Congress in its communications laws.	N
The FCC has before it perhaps the most exciting challenges of any agency in promoting the development of telecommunications aninformation technologies anservices during a time of economic difficulty in the industry ansecurity threats to our country.	N
I woullike to work towarachieving bipartisan solutions that maximize the ability of the Commission to contribute to productivity, economic growth animprovesecurity for the entire country.	N
Having been born anraisein one of the most rural states in the country, South Dakota, angiven my experience working on behalf of South Dakota for seven years in Senator Daschle's office, I see the value of quality communications anmedia services in people's lives.	N
My experience has taught me that these services can make a positive contribution to economic development, education, public safety, anthe quality of health care services available to people in need, In rural areas like the one where I was raised, the availability of the most advancecommunications technology can determine whether a small community can offer an economic future to its citizens, ancan even mean the difference between life andeath in the case of medical emergencies.	N
It is also clear that enhancing the quality of the nationwide telecommunications infrastructure improves the overall economy by increasing the productivity anefficiency of the entire Nation.	N
If confirmed, serving at the Commission will provide me with an opportunity to promote the transforming power of communications anmedia services in people's lives.	N
The FCC has been chargeby Congress with a key role in fostering competition, innovation anuniversal service.	N
Advancetechnologies can connect people to new opportunities anobliterate the distances between them.	N
They can contribute to our quality of life, ankeep this country competitive in the global economy.	N
If confirmed, I will work with the other Commissioners anthe many talentepeople at the Commission to help improve the telecommunications economy anpromote the deployment of the most advancetechnologies to every region ansector of American society, as envisioneby the Telecommunications Act of 1996.	N
3. What goals have you establishefor your first two years in this position, if confirmed?	N
If confirmed, my goals are to work towarexpanding access to telecommunications services for all Americans, including broadbanservices, to help restore the economic vitality of the telecommunications sector, anto address emerging public safety ansecurity needs.	N
In pursuing these goals, I will strive to faithfully carry out the communications laws enacteby Congress, consistent with Congressional intent ascertainefrom a plain reading of the statute anits legislative history.	N
In order to accomplish this most effectively, I will work to keep open animprove communications with Members of Congress antheir staffs.	N
Working firmly within that framework, I will seek to realize the goal of improving the economic climate of the telecommunications industry, which is currently witnessing an historic downturn, so that continueinnovation, investment andeployment can improve the level of services available to consumers.	N
This effort can be accomplishein part by working towarthe statutory goal of the Act itself, which calls for extending the availability of advancetelecommunications technology to all Americans in all regions including the ubiquitous deployment of broadband.	N
Finally, our country must have the most reliable ansountelecommunications infrastructure in order to meet new anemerging threats to our security.	N
Addressing the needs of the public safety community must remain at the very forefront of the Commission's agenda.	N
4. What skills do you believe you may be lacking which may be necessary to successfully carry out this position?	N
It woulbe difficult for any individual to master the intricacies of all of those many areas of jurisdiction.	N
Recognizing these difficulties, despite my years of experience in this field, I will examine even more intensively the many issues arising before the Commission, taking advantage of the greater access to information available to Commission members.	N
I realize that many different challenges face the legislative branch anindependent regulatory agencies of government.	N
If confirmed, in making the transition to the FCC, I will neeto reach out to the many experienceanskillepublic servants within the Commission.	N
Moreover, I will also draw on the experience of leading outside experts, including those in academia anpublic interest groups, anthat of the many leaders in the telecommunications industry.	N
I will also reach out to regular consumers anresidents of rural areas to learn about their perspectives.	N
Telecommunications is a rapidly changing fielanI will neeto refine my knowledge constantly to keep abreast of these changes.	N
I am confident this can be accomplisheby drawing on the seasoneCommission staff anleading technologists from outside the agency.	N
Include a discussion of when you believe the government shoulinvolve itself in the private sector, when shoulsociety's problems be left to the private sector, anwhat standards shoulbe useto determine when a government program is no longer necessary.	N
The UniteStates was foundeupon a Constitution that carefully enumerates powers available to the Federal Government, anplaces limits on those powers.	N
The American Revolution was largely a response to abuses of power by an unaccountable king.	N
Emerging from this beginning, the U.S. has, historically anproperly, retainea skeptical view of the role of government power.	N
Most importantly, it vesteresponsibility for limiting the encroachment of government into the private sector anpeople's lives not only through the Bill of Rights, but through a soundemocracy.	N
For officials in a regulatory agency such as the FCC, it is imperative not to exceethe authority delegateto the agency by Congress when applying regulations to the private sector.	N
Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, anregulators must restrain themselves from using their congressionally delegateauthority to exceethe limits of congressional mandates.	N
I consider the necessity for such judicial action a failure to interpret congressional intent in implementing the law and, if confirmed, woulstrive to avoisuch failure.	N
In my view, which happens to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act, competition is preferable to regulation as a means of encouraging innovation, lowering prices animproving the quality anavailability of services to consumers.	N
Some sectors of the telecommunications industry are already witnessing a competitive market, while others are still making the transition.	N
A greater government role may be needeto facilitate competition in less open markets, angovernment action may be necessary to stimulate service in other instances in which the market fails to address essential societal goals, such as the deployment of the advanceservices to rural areas.	N
In these exceptional circumstances, to make markets work best, the government shouloperate in a fair, clear anopen manner, establishing frameworks that are technologically ancompetitively neutral.	N
The goal must always be to get to the point where market forces ancompetition render governmental regulation unnecessary.	N
Once that point is achieved, the regulatory environment shouldiminish deftly anappropriately.	N
In terms of when government programs are no longer necessary, section 10 of the Communications Act provides useful guidance.	N
This provision authorizes the Commission to discontinue applying regulations that are no longer needeto prevent discrimination or other unjust practices or charges, or to protect consumers.	N
This provision specifically requires the Commission to weigh whether or not eliminating a regulation coulenhance competition.	N
In general, I agree with the proposition that a program or regulation is no longer needewhen the market failure it was designeto correct has been addressed.	N
For example, the government has historically promoteuniversal service in areas such as postal service antelephone service.	N
It has also establishea national highway system, anpromoteuniversal access to electricity.	N
In these cases, government has workein close cooperation with the private sector to accomplish laudable goals.	N
Whenever possible, the government shoulattempt to work in partnership with the private sector to address policy goals in areas where competition or the market alone might not accomplish them to the satisfaction of policymakers in Congress.	N
It is a core, bipartisan American value that the government shoulact to secure universal service for its citizens.	N
This policy goal, when met, enhances the value of the telecommunications network for all who use it, whether as consumers or providers.	N
In your own words, please describe the agency's current missions, major programs, anmajor operational objectives?	N
The FCC is an independent regulatory agency createby the Communications Act of 1934 to oversee emerging communications technologies by wire anradio.	N
Its mission has been expandeby subsequent amendments to include television, satellite ancable.	N
It is chargewith carrying out the responsibilities conferreupon it by Congress to help ``all the people of the UniteStates'' benefit from the best telecommunications system possible, anto do so at reasonable rates.	N
In short, the FCC regulates radio antelevision broadcasters, wire common carriers, wireless ansatellite communications providers, as well as multichannel video programmers, anhelps coordinate international ansatellite policies.	N
The FCC oversees the administration of universal service support programs, including high-	N
It enforces the Communications Act requirements in these fields anhandles public inquiries anconsumer complaints.	N
The FCC's mission, as detailein the statute, is to facilitate competition, promote universal service antechnological innovation, anto protect the public interest.	N
Much of its recent activities has involveimplementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.	N
Operationally, the FCC currently oversees a vast array of regulations that it must continually enforce anevaluate in light of changing market conditions antechnological change.	N
It must also responto input from Congress, anto any changes that Congress enacts to its current mission.	N
In reference to question number six, what forces are likely to result in changes to the mission of this agency over the coming five years?	N
The FCC's fundamental mission will change only to the extent that Congress amends the laws governing the agency, or that competition develops in a manner that obviates the neefor regulation.	N
Even if such fundamental developments do not occur, however, in certain areas the agency will confront the neeto responto technological innovation, anto accommodate rising demanfor spectrum annew wireless technologies, as well as to responto significant changes in the marketplace that may emerge.	N
In further reference to question number six, what are the likely outside forces which may prevent the agency from accomplishing its mission?	N
While outside forces are presenting challenges to the FCC, I am hopeful none of them will prevent it from accomplishing its statutory mission.	N
One great outside challenge now facing the agency is that changes in revenue streams are placing pressure on universal service, which may complicate efforts to ensure its sustainability anto encourage the deployment of advanceservices.	N
Secondly, increasing demands on spectrum are straining the ability of the agency to balance the neeto promote the deployment of advancewireless telecommunications services with the essential needs of national security anpublic safety.	N
Third, the Commission will neeadequate resources to carry out its mission as the telecommunications environment grows ever more technologically complex.	N
It will be a challenge to attract anretain the best-trainespecialists in the fields of telecommunications technology, economics, anlaw unless resources keep pace with the demands placeon the agency.	N
In further reference to question number six, what factors in your opinion have kept the department/agency from achieving its missions over the past several years?	N
The agency can improve communications with Congress so that emerging problems can be addressein the most cooperative manner possible.	N
In addition, the judicial review process has leincreasingly to inconsistent interpretations of the law, in some cases due to inadequate efforts to provide objective justification for some of the regulatory positions the agency has taken.	N
There is also a neeto show more dedication to expeditiously anresponsively addressing section 254 of the Telecommunications Act in light of the changing nature of the marketplace.	N
The primary stakeholders are residential anbusiness consumers of telecommunications services.	N
Congress, which createthe agency, is also a primary stakeholder which is accountable anresponsive to those consumers.	N
Telecommunications businesses that provide services to consumers are, of course, key stakeholders.	N
Others include the White House, relateexecutive branch agencies, state regulators, aninternational governments.	N
What is the proper relationship between your position, if confirmed, anthe stakeholders identifiein question number ten?	N
It must act to preserve its independence if its decisions are to be regardeas objective anfair.	N
Given this position, the agency must always keep focuseon its mission, as embodiein the Communications Act, to protect consumers anpromote the public interest.	N
As such, it is imperative that Commissioners maintain close communications with Congress so as to reflect most accurately its intentions with regarto the law anattenmost efficiently to Members' concerns as raiseby their various constituencies.	N
Commissioners shoulwork cooperatively with outside stakeholders, listen carefully to their concerns, anresponto those concerns in a manner consistent with the law.	N
Commissioners shoulhear anconsider fully the competing visions of the many providers of telecommunications services anevaluate what outcomes woulbest serve the public interest as intendeby the Act.	N
All stakeholders shoulbe hearantreatefairly, but none shoulbe granteany special treatment in terms of access or outcomes.	N
The Chief Financial Officers Act requires all government departments anagencies to develop sounfinancial management practices similar to those practicein the private sector.	N
a) What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure your agency has proper management anaccounting controls?	N
If confirmed, I will consider it my responsibility to work closely with anoversee agency management anadministrative personnel, anhelp to ensure a clean audit.	N
The Act specifies that the Chairman is to serve as the chief executive officer of the Commission, anthe Commission has hirea Chief Financial Officer.	N
At the same time, all Commissioners are responsible for overseeing anassisting with the management of the agency in order to comply with statutory mandates.	N
I will seek to work closely with these officials to help establish the most effective organizational structure anthe most efficient use of the budgetary resources provideby Congress.	N
In terms of what will most closely fall under my purview if confirmed, I will employ diligence ancareful scrutiny in administering the resources of my office.	N
AnI woulencourage the FCC, in their deliberations, to remember that it was not only the sentiment expresseby this Committee, chaireby our great leader from Arizona, but it was also the entire Senate, in an overwhelming vote, that gave you direction on this issue of media ownership anthen the tangential issue of the cross-ownership.	N
Anwe have an additional incentive for freeing up spectrum; it's callethe 9/11 Commission Report.	N
Mr. Chairman, since we have two of our distinguishecitizens from my state here, I woulwant to pick up on Senator Lott's comments earlier that he's concernethe partisan andivisive nature that has gotten into this political discourse.	N
I'm glafor your last comment there, because of my concern about media consolidation, anespecially in public broadcasting, that there be some flexibility for local decisionmaking.	N
I mean, my sense is that the next Congress will spena fair amount of time, particularly on this Committee, talking about that issue.	N
I think you've been quoteas saying government shoulnot use the universal service funto funcompetition for competition's sake.	N
I don't want to see rural communities helhostage to one high, fixewireline cost, when competition of services are going to continue to evolve in the short term.	N
So I'm curious as how you see that in the near term, anwhat do you think this looks like 10 or 15 years from now?	N
Do you think individual states are making that challenge harfor wireless solution providers?	N
Do you think we neeto do something here in Congress to clarify the other terms anconditions clause that states sometimes interpret in various ways--to use that as a hammer to prevent access in competition?	N
Have some states gone too far in not allowing competition anmaking it harder for the wireless solution providers?	N
Have they oversteppeon what was meant by Congress on terms anconditions, in your opinion?	N
I guess I'm not clear what you--whether you think the problem has been solveor you think you shouljust continue to give guidance or whether this body needs to have more discussion about this issue.	N
Woulyou predict, in the next 5 years, that there woulbe a larger use of the universal service funfor wireless providers?	N
ownership issue, I know people have talkeabout media consolidation, but I think we're, in the Northwest, one of the areas that was covereby a newspaper that is an independent family owned--I think it's only about 20 percent a newspaper.	N
If you get very large chains of newspapers, for example, their tendency is to--in order to save money, is to use one story that applies to all, or even borrow from other news services.	N
Anthat's an aspect of media concentration that I don't think we have paias much attention to as we shoulhave, as well.	N
I think that the Congress is probably supposeto be out either tomorrow or Saturday sometime, anwe'll try anget it done before then.	N
Thank you for your willingness to serve, anthank you for being here today, anwe look forwarto seeing again in the future.	N
I am truly delighteto be here this morning to introduce Annette Sandberg, who is President Bush's nominee to be the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrator.	N
As you well know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is just 3 years olanso it's a relatively new agency within the Department of Transportation, but this agency has an extremely important mission in overseeing our Nation's commercial motor vehicle industry.	N
We know there are many safety issues that neeattention, from the commercial driver's license program to the transportation of hazardous materials.	N
She comes with a strong backgrounin law enforcement, including over 17 years with the Washington State Patrol.	D
In fact, in 1995, Annette became the first woman in the country to leaa State police agency when she was appointechief of the Washington State Patrol, a position that she helfor 6 years.	D
Annette holds a law degree from the University of Puget Sound, ana master's in business administration from City University in Bellevue, Washington.	D
In March of 2002, the President appointeher Deputy Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.	D
In December, she was nameActing Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.	D
Under Annette's leadership at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the final rule revising the hours of service in the motor carrier industry was finally releasejust a few weeks ago.	D
Anwhether one agrees or disagrees with all parts of the final rule, it is quite impressive that Annette coulget the job done while performing in an acting capacity.	D
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to join with my senior Senator in praising the work that Annette Sandberg has done anfor nominating her for this position as Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.	D
Many of the Committee members will probably know her or got to know her in her role as the Deputy Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or as the Acting Director of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.	D
But for us in Washington State, as Senator Murray said, we've known this woman, she's haa long andistinguishecareer.	D
AnSenator Murray mentionethat she was the first female chief of the State Patrol, anwas the first female chief of any State patrol in the country, anshe diso at the wise olage of 33, so she has been blazing a trail for some time.	D
As a State trooper, she earneboth her law degree anmaster's degree, so she accomplishea lot while holding down that responsibility.	D
Anin the 6 years as the chief of the patrol, Annette Sandberg's achievement in approving a new canine dog unit to sniff out drug importation into our State, which is very important for us.	D
Being on the Canadian border, we've haa lot of activity, anthat program has been a great success, actually more successful than actually having more manpower on the border, having these canine dogs because they do a very efficient job.	D
She made sure that Washington was among the first States to be collecting data on traffic stops animplementing officer training in this area, so again, groundbreaking work.	D
But as Annette has tolmany people, including her colleagues, she believes that roasafety is one of her big passions anshe woullike to continue that work.	D
So that's why I'm prouhere today to recommenher to the Committee with all the highest regards from her work in the State anher most recent work in this position.	D
I know that in this position of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, she will do a tremendous job in serving the country, anI am so excitethat she is here before the Committee, anmaybe in light of the Committee attendance, I will ask to try to ask a not so harquestion, but something that woulbring out some of the issues that Annette has gainesuch expertise anthat our country will benefit from.	D
I know you have other responsibilities, but I thank you for taking the time to be here to introduce the witness.	N
The State of New Jersey gets more than its share of truck traffic, even though it doesn't get its fair share in my view of federal dollars, but that's something we will work on at other meetings.	N
I understananwe are pleaseto have such a qualifiecandidate for a position like this, it's an important responsibility.	D
If one sees these 58-foot trucks, anI wrote some legislation years ago to limit the access of triple trailers to our roads in New Jersey, anto keep them from any other State that at that moment didn't have them.	N
Now, I understanthat FMCSA is committeto reducing the truck, large truck fatality rate by 41 percent by the year 2008, anI think that's a worthy goal.	N
We know that almost 5,000 people diein accidents involving trucks in 2001, and, including 71 large trucks involvein fatal crashes in New Jersey.	N
Now, there are a number of proposals from the trucking industry anothers to increase the size anweight of the trucks on the interstates including lifting the freeze on LCVs, triples, doubles, anMiss Sandberg, I realize that trucks play an important role in our national transportation system.	N
But how do you--anwe will be looking to you for advice anperhaps enforcement of the laws that exist now, so that we can make more sense for our propositions to improve safety.	N
Is your agency considering any changes to the freeze on LCVs anwoulthe Agency under your jurisdiction entertain any proposals to change the current LCV freeze?	N
Senator Lautenberg, coulI just ask that perhaps Ms. Sandberg coulgive an opening statement, if that woulbe okay, anthen I will go right back to you for your questions.	N
Welcome, Ms. Sandberg, anthen we will go, if you coulright after your statement, perhaps responto Senator Lautenberg's question.	N
Because it appears to be that case, a lot of pressure coming from the trucking industry to get larger trucks out there.	N
AnI can tell you that speaking for New Jersey, who has more than, as I mentioned, its fair share of the truck traffic, because we are the north-south direct route, anour highways constantly are up for rehab, repair, anit's a mess.	N
Anwe've had, as I mentioneto you earlier, a 2-hour wait to cross the George Washington Bridge that goes from New Jersey to New York, but yet the pressure exists.	N
We want to accommodate growth anefficient movement of goods, but then we've got to make changes way aheaof the arrival of those days, anput the appropriate funds into highways.	N
AnI know that our New Jersey Turnpike, which is our busiest road, has a separation of cars antrucks for much of its distance, anit's a more comfortable feeling, I've driven on that road, not to have some giant behinyou breathing down your back at 80 miles an hour.	N
So I just hope that we're going to be very cautious about making any recommendations to increase weight ansize on any roathat doesn't clearly have the safety structure to accommodate it.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for bringing up the war issues, because they are important to both of our States anto the country in the sense of security is only as gooas the efficiency that goes along with it.	N
Do you think that it's helped, do you think that we neeto amore inspectors, what shoulthat process be?	N
Anthen looking at some of the--I know you talkevery specifically, but if you were going to categorize your broagoals as the new Administrator, how woulyou categorize them?	N
Because you have some challenges, some of the technology from the Customs side that has been implementeannot been as successful as we woullike.	N
So as I mentioned, the efficiency of the system obviously impacts the economy of the country as well, certainly impacts the economy of our state as well, but what's the process?	N
I'm concernebecause we employesome of these technologies anwe founthat they workereally well on the southern border, probably relateto the conditions ancircumstances of the southern border, not so well in the wet anwindy Northwest, so some of that technology hasn't been too successful.	N
That decisionmaking process, is that within the Agency or do you involve the larger IT group within DOT? 	N
Ms. Sandberg, we will move your nomination to the floor as quickly as possible, anwe want you to be able to get to work with some job security.	N
Anwe thank you for your willingness to serve the country anwe look forwarto working with you on issues of great importance to the nation in the future.	N
It is certainly my great pleasure to be here this morning to introduce a fellow Arkansan ana former colleague of mine in our State's congressional delegation, Congressman Asa Hutchinson.	N
President Bush has nominateAsa Hutchinson as Under Secretary for Border anTransportation Security in the new Department of HomelanSecurity.	N
I have hanumerous opportunities to work with Mr. Hutchinson on a variety of topics over the last several years, so I have seen firsthanthe commitment, the energy, anthe foresight that he brings to his career in public service, anI am delightethat he has been selectefor this critical position.	D
I trust that the Committee is familiar with Mr. Hutchinson's impressive resume, so I will not take the time here to recount his many accomplishments.	D
I would, however, like to emphasize the fact that, baseupon his past experience as a Federal prosecutor; as also an electemember of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Northwest Arkansas; anas an administrator of a Federal law enforcement agency comprising over 10,000 employees, Asa Hutchinson has developeanhonethe leadership anexecutive skills that will make him a valuable asset to this new department.	D
I am very confident that he will bring to this position at the Department of HomelanSecurity the same commitment, integrity, anvision that he has brought to his service in Congress anthe Drug Enforcement Administration.	D
In the aftermath of September 11th, 2001, it has become clear that our Nation's security cannot be taken for granted.	N
Among the newly createDepartment of HomelanSecurity's chief objectives will be to reduce our Nation's vulnerability to terrorist attacks anto prevent terrorist attacks against the UniteStates.	N
These objectives will be met, in part, at our Nation's borders anin our Nation's transportation system, both of which present potential vulnerabilities.	N
I am very pleasethat the Department of HomelanSecurity will draw on Asa Hutchinson's expertise in addressing these vulnerabilities anmake the UniteStates a safer place for all Americans.	D
As a fellow Arkansan, I am prouof him, anI am happy to support his nomination to this distinguisheposition.	D
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to come anintroduce my fellow colleague from Arkansas.	N
As I mentioned, we are here to welcome a friend, a former colleague in the House, ana man who has servehis State anhis Nation with distinction.	D
We are very prouthat he is willing to serve anthat the President of the UniteStates has chosen him for this most important set of responsibilities.	N
I woullike to point out that his duties will have jurisdiction over many existing Governmental entities, including the Customs Service, Transportation Security Administration, Federal Protective Service of the General Services Administration, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center of the Department of the Treasury, anthe Office for Domestic Preparedness of the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice.	N
Before we proceefurther, perhaps, Mr. Hutchinson, you woullike to introduce your family members, who are with us today, who we welcome here.	N
I do want to strongly associate myself with your comments anwith the firmness anemotion that accompaniethem.	N
I also want to welcome Administrator Hutchinson ansay that--I will save my questions for when that comes--but that I hanot haa chance, Mr. Chairman, to know Asa Hutchinson particularly well until we took a trip together to South America anhaa chance then to really discover that maybe we were OK, each of us, as people, anwe have been goofriends since then.	N
where even our newest members, who we welcome with enthusiasm, and, may I say, far more enthusiasm than the member to your left----	N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you for that early birrecognition of being here.	N
It is an honor to serve on this Committee anit is an honor to serve in the historical context of one of the great figures in our State, Warren Magnuson, having been on this Committee for 37 years anchairing it for some time.	N
I do also want to thank Director Hutchinson for his time today anhis efforts in Washington State on methamphetamine ana variety of other issues.	N
Obviously, the issue of borders is very important to the northern tier of the country, as well, anI look forwarto your comments today about how we continue to upgrade the amount of manpower that we have put on the border.	N
While we have made some progress in the last Congress of actually, I think, tripling the authorization anactually doubling the number of people, the bottom line is it still remains about 9,000 people on the southern border anabout 600 on the northern border.	N
So we have haa variety of challenges given that we are a border State next to such a large population center, anthe complexity of also obviously having a lot of container traffic going in anout of those ports.	N
So it is no surprise that after the Rasaam case in Washington State, where someone came through anthe Customs agents actually caught a terrorist on their way to either blow up LAX or the Space Needle or whatever it was, that we have heighteneour interest in making sure that we do not have a porous border there.	N
So I am very interestein your new responsibilities as it relates to implementing a section of the Patriot Act dealing with a biometric standard.	N
We are very interestein seeing a process by which either facial or fingerprint recognition can be a more stable source, working with countries abroato determine who shoulget a visa prior to being let into the country, as opposeto the process that we are pursuing today, trying to track people once they are already here, or the large number of deportations that are about to happen.	N
You will be responsible for implementing that part of the Patriot Act, so I look forwarto your comments on that.	N
Anthen, last, just the process that we can work with together on, port security, anthe fact that container cargo coulbe as close as a mile away, to 30,000 fans watching a Mariner or a Seahawk game, anhow we implement gooborder security--container security at our ports, as well.	N
I look forwarto your rapiconfirmation, hopefully this afternoon, anworking with you on those issues in Washington State.	N
I hope that you will immediately start looking at tamper-proof passports, tamper-proof visas, a tracking system so that we know who is in our country anwhen they either disappear or leave.	N
Certainly, aviation has come a long way since 9/11, but air cargo is still an area that we must address to make sure that everything that goes on an airplane is lookeat anwe know that it is safe.	N
They are doing a lot on their own, but they cannot do the whole job on their own without Federal help anFederal guidelines.	N
I will ask you some questions, as well, but I know that you have haa huge learning curve.	N
To take over the INS anall of the transportation security in our country is an awesome responsibility.	N
I will say that I think Admiral Loy has done a remarkable job in a very short time with the aviation side, annow he has saihe is turning to ports another modes of transportation, which I think is correct.	N
So I look forwarto working with you as the chairman of the Service Transportation Subcommittee, anwith the chairman, to make sure that all of our borders anour transportation modes are secure.	N
Anthank you, Congressman--anI still refer to you as Congressman--Hutchinson, for agreeing to take this very important andifficult task on.	N
Our appreciation goes out to your family for being willing to tolerate the demands that are going to be placeon your time in the weeks anmonths ahead.	N
Your two terms in the House, your experience as U.S. Attorney, and, of course, your experience as the Administrator of DEA, provides you with an insight in to the nature of the threat anthe neefor Federal agencies to work with each other anState anlocal governments to protect the UniteStates from external aninternal threats.	D
I believe you are going to neeevery bit of that experience, knowledge anleadership, because you are taking on one of the most difficult tasks that I have seen an individual or a new Under Secretary to have to deal with.	D
secretaries, I think yours is the one that is going to be the most important andifficult because of all the different functions anfacilities anorganizations that you are going to have to try to bring into one that makes sense anworks together.	N
I have been, like most senators, trying to keep an eye on how well the Transportation Security Administration has been working.	N
Just yesterday, I took the time to go through the facility at Lexington, Kentucky, to look at what they were doing, anlook at the people.	N
I think we have given you a challenge in getting all these different entities to work together.	N
In one instance, at least, the Coast Guarwill not be locatein your directorate, anI think it is going to be very important that the Coast Guaranthe Border Patrol anINS, all of them, are working together in a cooperative way.	N
So I will have a couple of questions, some even a little parochial, although John McCain woulcertainly not expect that from me----	N
AnI, too, think that Asa Hutchinson's going to be an excellent choice for this position.	D
First, with respect to the border, I think Mr. Hutchinson knows that there is a long history of Government officials announcing, with tremendous fanfare, various programs to better enforce the borders, anthey always seem to peter out, anI think what I woulespecially like to hear is how your office, pushing the U.S. Congress, will break that cycle anensure that this time, the job really does get the followup that is warranted.	D
As someone who has really specializein technology issues, anhas hathe chance to serve under Senator Rockefeller on the Intelligence Committee, I think we have got to beef up information sharing, anthere is the technology today to do this job right.	N
With the agencies you have got, INS, Border Patrol, anCustoms, if one of them sits on information andoes not get it out throughout the network, everything is going to fall apart, anclearly, that is something post-9/11 that we are aware of, anyou will have a chance to do something about it.	N
I think if there is one thing that we have seen, in terms of trying to holthe key agencies accountable, we have got to have protections for whistleblowers.	N
I think James Loy is off to a very goostart, but he has signesome orders recently that do, in my view, affect our ability to get information with respect to mismanagement.	D
I will be asking about those issues, as well, anlook forwarto your service ansupporting you in the confirmation process.	N
I truly enjoyeour visit the other day, anthank you for the courtesy you showeme, anmany of my colleagues, I am sure, to come by our offices.	N
I am perhaps repeating much of what has been said, but I think Chairman McCain really hit on one of the issues that the American people feel very keenly, anthat is the integrity of our borders.	N
If you listen to talk radio at all, you will know that there is an incessant demanfor militarization of our borders, anI am not advocating that, but I notice that, in your record, you actually divote for that.	N
I woulbe interesteto know if you still think that the UniteStates military has a role to play on our borders.	N
Having saithat, as someone who workewith Ron Wyden anothers to try to make sense out of our immigration policy with respect to migrant workers, it is a fact that there are a few crops in agriculture, those that are labor intensive, that woulsimply shut down in the UniteStates if there were not some ability to employ migrant workers.	N
Some of us have workevery harto finthe right compromise to bring some rationality into a visa program that woulallow them to work angive them the safety to return, anthe integrity of law under which they coullive while they are here, anwe have been frustrateat every turn.	N
Anwe, as a country, have a special reason anrelationship to keep a special relationship with Mexico anCanada, anI think these are very difficult times, because of terrorism's overlay on everything we are talking about here.	N
Please be mindful that--when it comes to the INS, there are some local sensibilities, too, particularly, in the State of Oregon, where we have haa very unfortunate recent experience with a local director there that, fortunately, has been removed, but--as it relates to racial profiling in a very flagrant aninvasive way.	N
I am pleased, Mr. Chairman, to join with you anthe other Members of the Commerce Committee in welcoming this very capable individual to take this post.	N
It is an important post that you are taking, anthe country is putting a huge reliance upon you.	N
This Committee, as you know, is going to oversee key functions of the DHS, including transportation security.	N
These responsibilities are a vital part of the new department anwill present an enormous challenge.	N
As Under Secretary for Border anTransportation Security, you will have to strike the balance between keeping our borders, roads, rails, anairways safe without unduly hindering the commerce antravel of Americans.	N
Anin response to the Chairman's plea, or the Chairman's interest in avoiding the border intrusions that we see, there is no section of our great country that is not subject to intrusions, one way or the other, whether it is desert borders or mountain borders or sea borders, as we have it in my area of the country.	N
I look forwarto hearing how, if you are confirmeas Under Secretary for Border anTransportation Security, you plan to execute the enormous responsibilities of this office, to oversee the protection of the Nation's 300 ports, 7500 miles of border, 95,000 miles of shoreline.	N
Anafter September 11, we understandably focuseon aviation security first anforemost.	N
All Americans who fly now see real changes in the security procedures that beguile us as we go to the airport.	N
In my State, crisscrossewith a network of commuter rail lines and, of course, Amtrak, we must make sure that rail security is a real priority.	N
The Port of New Jersey anNew York is the largest port complex on the East Coast of North America, anour port is critical to our region's infrastructure anthe economy.	N
Anthis directorate also has the responsibility, as you well know, for a very important agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for immigration practices ancross-border animal anplant inspections, all the vital components of our homelansecurity anvital to my home State of New Jersey.	N
But I have observeour candidate's ability, Mr. Chairman, anskill, anI was impressed, I must tell you, anI tolthis to you personally, even though we were on different sides of the issue, I hathe utmost respect for your professionalism anyour capacity to take on assignments.	D
AnI just wish you the strength anenergy to handle this important task for your country.	N
AnI look forwarto hearing from you about your strategies to undertake this enormous task.	N
I am delighteto be here today to consider the nomination of Asa Hutchinson to this position, one that obviously does represent significant responsibilities.	N
Anobviously there is going to be a sense of urgency with all the compelling obligations that you will be assuming in becoming Under Secretary for Border anTransportation Security.	N
AnI have no doubt that you will provide the kinof leadership that is essential to ensuring our Nation's homelansecurity.	D
I was reading someplace that your agency will have the most employees within the HomelanSecurity Department.	N
So with that, you know what you are undertaking in terms of beginning to grapple with the myriachallenges in coordinating anreally reconciling a number of agencies that you will have to transcenthe historic cultures that have characterizethese agencies in the past.	N
As one who has been involvein information sharing since the aftermath of the 1993 WorlTrade Center bombing, I can assure you that information sharing still will become one of the most profounchallenges that you will face in your position.	N
In addition, obviously, consultation, coordination, ancommunication will also be vital ingredients to making your agency work.	N
If you reathe report that was issueby the Hart-Rudman Commission last fall, that America is still dangerously unpreparefor a terrorist attack on our soil, obviously we have to accelerate timetables that exist in a number of areas.	N
When I look at the gap in--for example, port security, which is still one of the most, I think, significant gaps in our security system in America.	N
When you think about the fact that only 1 to 2 percent of the 6 million containers that come from overseas are inspected, an95 percent of our trade from outside North America moves to the UniteStates by sea, it is absolutely vital that we focus on this front line of defense.	N
So obviously, we have much more to do, anI woulhope that you will be able to work with us, here in this Committee as well as in Congress, to begin to create a comprehensive plan, particularly for high-risk container shipments, so that we can begin to profile those, to alert authorities, to focus their limiteinspection anenforcement resources on those that represent the most high-risk containers.	N
In addition, we ought to make sure that radiation detection devices are given to each inspector, as well.	N
So I hope that these security measures can move in a most urgent fashion to begin to really address anfill some of the gaps when it comes to port security.	N
As one who chairs the subcommittee that oversees the Coast Guard's responsibilities, I will be holding a hearing to examine their role in fulfilling the mandates under law with respect to homelansecurity.	N
But, again, I woulurge you to work hand-in-glove with the Coast Guarto ensure that everything, in terms of procedures anprocess, is operational.	N
It is important that we do not wait until dangerous cargo is interceptewhen it is in our ports.	N
We obviously have to make sure anprevent that from happening before they get into our ports, anthat is where the Coast Guaris going to be playing a primary function.	N
AnSenator Hutchison has been working on that anhas introducelegislation last week, anI have introducelegislation, as well, in working with her, because we really do have to examine the gaps that currently exist when it comes to air cargo.	N
You know, half of a passenger planes hull consists of air cargo, anyet it remains uninspected.	N
I think we have to begin to take steps in that direction, authenticating those who are shipping this cargo so that we know who the shippers are, so that we have some identity of the air carriers another entities involvein aviation shipping.	N
I applauthe remarkable willingness that you have shown in addressing these issues that are facing our country today, anI wish you well.	D
It is extraordinary, in the worlof intelligence, how goowe are at collecting, anhow poor we are at analyzing anthen disseminating, otherwise calle``sharing.''	N
Anwe have come to a point in our Nation's life where that is no longer acceptable, anyou understanthat very well.	N
We created, in the TSA, the Transportation Security Oversight Board, anso the whole question of monitoring of intelligence becomes very much a part of our job anof your job.	N
Anincidentally, in terms of our job, as well as the Administration's job, to funwhat it is that you have to do.	N
It is goofor all of us to talk about what you neeto do, but if the Administration does not funit or we do not funit, then we become hypocritical in what it is that we say.	N
We have already confirmeGovernor Ridge, so I neeto assume that you have sat down with him since that point anhave discussea bit the question of intelligence anthe question of collecting and, most importantly, of sharing intelligence within these various agencies anwithin the various agencies which you will oversee.	N
You do not neeto answer that, but will you be willing to come to the Intelligence Committee or to this Committee, on an unclassifiebasis, to discuss these matters?	N
Well, we have five centers now for the collection ananalysis, distribution of intelligence, if you include the Under Secretary of Defense.	N
9/11 startethrough small airports, anthose of us who live, as do you, in rural States neeto know that there will be a commitment, not just to seeing the magnificent results that we do with the Pittsburghs another larger arenas, that you are on track anconscious of security for our smaller airports arounthe country.	N
Our country is not yet familiar with biometrics anwhat its implications are, both for the security anthe identification, and, from that security, leading to greater security through knowledge of who is anis not in this country, anwho is anwho might not be dangerous.	N
That has to be done instantaneously when we develop a full real-time system of checking people in at airports.	N
It also, of course, is something that woulappear, on the surface, to violate people's personal rights, even as they are doing the same thing at ATMs, but they do not make the connection.	N
I am a strong believer in biometrics, anI woulhope that you woulnot only encourage that technology anthat use which is still to be even further developed, but that you will then be able to share that with all agencies within your jurisdiction anoutside of your jurisdiction.	N
I will come back to that, actually, because it is an important topic, anmy office has been involvewith that as it relates to the Patriot Act, anI think you are right on target as it relates to getting international cooperation.	N
The point that you were bringing up largely on technology animplementing technology, we have run into a particular problem as it relates to the northern border, in that we have so much territory that the unstaffeareas have been a challenge.	N
Unfortunately, the technology that has been deployewas really much more scaletowardesert terrain.	N
AnI think as people have deployethem in the rainy Northwest, in the forest areas, they have founout that they do not work as well.	N
In fact, we have haan investigation reveal that much of the time they are water-logged, that there is not an adequate power supply, that the software does not work, that the cameras are not really tracking the information.	N
So how will you go about evaluating those technology tools anmaking sure that the demonstration projects really are on track and, if they are not on track, that we look at different ways to supply the resources?	N
We will get you that specific case that has gotten a lot of attention in the Northwest and, obviously, generates a lot of concern of citizens.	N
Can we see a continueadvocacy on an increase in northern border staffing, annot a reduction?	N
If the technology we deploy is not as effective or we cannot get effective technology for those porous areas of huge, vast amounts of land, then we neeto look at other solutions.	N
Anthen back to this issue that my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, raiseor expoundeon.	N
We have haa lot of debate in Washington State, obviously a variety of people of interest to the FBI, but also a lot of concern about the deportation, anI just am interestein this entry-exit system anthe special registration of Arab males.	N
But I think if you can work on that oversight you have of a visas--a biometric standard, working with foreign countries, so that you know who people are--because we are going to continue to have millions of people who enter anthen overstay.	N
But if we really know who people are anwe have cooperation from foreign governments, it is going to make our job easier.	N
Senator Feinstein anI askefor a GAO report to give us the status of air cargo security, anwe founthat there were a number of holes.	N
As people stanin long lines to get in an airplane anthey take off their shoes aneverything they can think of that might make the machine go off, we have not lookeat the belly of the airplane nearly as carefully.	N
We are now checking most of the checkebags that go in the belly, but cargo is another area.	N
Airlines want to start carrying mail again, anI think it woulbe important for them to do so, but only when we have a security system in place for mail anair cargo.	N
Ando you support legislation that woulgive the Transportation Security Agency all the tools it needs to decertify an air cargo carrier or handler that does not comply with strict rules of security?	N
AnSenator Lott anI have talkeabout it, anSenator Rockefeller anI workeon it last year.	N
So while our ports have done a great deal on their own, there is no way they couldo everything possible or have access to everything they woulneeto fully secure these very important ports.	N
You mentionethe Coast Guard, anI want to say I do support the Coast Guarbeing in the Department of HomelanSecurity, because I think the Coast Guaris now more important than ever before.	N
What are your plans regarding the beefing up of the Coast Guarfor its adderesponsibilities of security?	N
Well, I woulhope that you woulincrease their capabilities, because I think they are going to have a lot more responsibility.	N
The machine-readable visas that have been usefor pedestrian traffic on the southern border have been very successful.	N
However, the pedestrian traffic delays have increasebecause of just the sheer volume of people who are coming over now.	N
Are you going use some of the 150 million INS technological improvements in infrastructure money to look at expediting, not only the pedestrians, but the cars antrucks with these kinds of machine-readable visas where people have proven anhave their clearances?	N
AnI guess they are all the parts of a couple of dozen agencies, bureaus, parts of departments, anprobably a dozen pieces from all over the place.	N
I remember asking several months ago, I guess--maybe 16 months ago or so--our friend, Tom Ridge, ``As we consolidate andevelop efficiencies anlearn to do a better job spending money more wisely, is it possible we couldo this job with fewer people?''	N
I never quite got an answer to that, because I know everybody has been committeto doing the job, which is so important, anwe have so far to go that you do not want to get too trippeup in, you know, trying to do it with fewer people or doing it efficiently.	N
But, you know, you are from Arkansas, anI am familiar with your voting record, anI hope that you will see, you know, along the way, if you can do these things with the people you have more efficiently, more effectively, anmaybe with less money or fewer people.	N
Analso I think one of the things we are going to experience here--in some areas, we are going to go too far too fast, anwe are going to have to back away from it a little bit ansay, ``Well, maybe we overdithat, or we went too far,'' anwe are going to have to reevaluate it.	N
Just one example, you were talking about what Customs has been doing with regarto air cargo imports.	N
I understanthat they have now come up with a proposal that woulrequire that detailemanifest information be submitteto Customs at least 8 hours before loading the aircraft for air express packages, an12 hours for loading--for other air cargo.	N
Clearly, the cargo area is one that we have got to be concerneabout, anwe have got to ask ourselves, ``How do we deal with it in the commercial passenger aircraft, anin--	N
But in this case, what you wouldo woulbe to effectively eliminate overnight express shipments.	N
Anso I guess what I am asking you is that--is a commitment that you are going to continue to look at ways to do these things better, more effectively, more efficiently, maybe with, sometimes, different people or better people, fewer people, analso to make sure that we do not go too far sometime without having a hearing.	N
A lot of things we have done, we now neeto come back anask ourselves, ``Are the right people paying for these costs?	N
One area where Members of Congress took an action was the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act, anyet we are not quite sure exactly how that is going to work, or when it is going to work, or who is going to train these pilots.	N
For instance, I have been tolthat you are thinking that maybe this training woulbe done internally.	N
Anso I hope you will look very carefully at how this program is going to be carrieout, implemented, who woultrain the--I woulthink you woulbe much better off contracting with some private sector that has experience in training people for this specific purpose.	N
I hope you will pay close attention to how that is implemented, because I think it coulbe important.	N
The border is very important, obviously, all over the country, because we do have a flooof illegal immigrants that are risking their lives, analso it can be a place where terrorists can come in.	N
But the one area that still worries me is--I guess, it is maybe because I am more familiar with it, as opposeto the Senators from Texas anArizona--are the ports.	N
I still know we have got a lot more capability than I thought we woulhave at this point, anthey are doing a pretty goojob, but I still think there is a huge risk at ports all arounthis country.	N
Anwhile we diprovide $93 million for port security grants to airports, I believe, in the fiscal year 2002 budgeting--none of that went to ports between New Orleans anTampa, for instance there were 22 applicants for grants; none of those, including the No. 1 of the 22, were approved.	N
I know the bigger ports, obviously, have the greater risk--New York, Baltimore, anports in Texas anCalifornia anso forth--but we also have huge risk at some of these smaller ports, anI hope that you will look at making sure the ones that are particularly potentially dangerous do get some assistance, ansome attention is paito allocation of those funds in terms of neeangeographical distribution.	N
Several of my colleagues talkeabout the question of sharing information among the various agencies that are in your jurisdiction.	N
Anmy question to you at this point is, How woulyou see breaking the mindset among these various agencies that tento keep information to themselves.	N
I think it is clear you are right with respect to computers anmaking sure that they are in place to share information, but I am concernethat unless you break this mindset, it will eventually lapse into something resembling business as usual.	N
I mean, let us say the Coast Guarspots some suspicious material, something that coulbe an ingredient for a chemical or a biological attack.	N
Relateingredients show up at a Customs department office, say, on the northern border, which we have been concerneabout.	N
Anthen, at the same time, immigration authorities or the FBI have their eye on a suspicious set of individuals.	N
Here you have got three agencies, where, historically, they woulbe inclineto work in isolation.	N
On the whistleblower issue that I mentioneearlier, I woullike to hear your thoughts anhave you use this opportunity to sena signal to the workers that it is safe to come forward.	N
I think there is great concern with respect to the workers right now, ancertainly the TSA order recently, the Transportation Security order, has raiseadditional questions with respect to employees' rights.	N
Anagain, just, let us take a hypothetical, anlet us say the recordkeeping andata-entry systems are so poor that key information that is important to fighting terrorists gets lost, ansomebody wants to come forward.	N
I am convincethat a lot of people are very fearful about coming forwarin this climate, anI woullike to have you use this opportunity to state how you feel ansena message that you want that information.	N
On this whistleblower issue, having workewith a lot of them in various areas, including intelligence anhealthcare anthe like, I wouljust tell you, the first couple of cases are going to be absolutely key, because yours is a brand-new department with a huge number of employees.	N
If you handle the first couple of whistleblower cases in a way that shows that you have confidence in the employees, that is going to be everything.	N
If they look at those first couple of cases ansay, ``We are going to get bounceif we come forward,'' I think it is going to be very, very damaging.	N
There has been a lot of discussion of technology throughout the different lines of questioning today.	N
It came up, of course, with biometrics, with some of the questions about visas that Senator Hutchison was asking, border patrols, ansome of the checked-baggage screening, as well.	N
It seems that it is going to be critical to the success of the new agency, anin your work in particular.	N
Are there any other areas of technology that you think are particularly important, or will be going forward, or are technologies that you woulwant to highlight to this Committee in our efforts, moving forward, to try to help you do your job more effectively?	N
Is the same individual who is going to have responsibility for data base management aninformation systems going to also have responsibility for ensuring that new equipment to screen all checkebaggage is put in place at the airports?	N
How do you separate those different types of technology, anis there someone in the new agency that will have overall responsibility?	N
Anyou mentionethat position before, the research directorate, anI think that is important.	N
But I think, in some ways, the bigger challenge anthe more immediate challenge is going to be to take existing technologies that really have never been usein this kinof a domestic capacity before--the Chairman mentionethe use of drones on the border, for example--anthere will really neeto be someone that has an expertise in the area of applying technology to solve real-worlproblems that is assisting the agency, I think.	N
I do not know that it is the same position as someone running a research lab, anit is--I do not believe it is the same position as someone who typically manages an information technology system or a data base system.	N
Those are very important roles, but I think that is going to be one of the challenges, is not looking out 20 years to new technologies, but let us just take some available technologies anuse them better today.	N
Obviously, port security is one of the major concerns expresseby many Members of this Committee.	N
Anreferring back to the Hart-Rudman report, it indicatethat the port vulnerability studies for the Nation's 50 largest ports are not expecteor scheduleto be completefor five more years.	N
It woulseem to me, given the imperative of this issue anthe impact that it coulhave, not only, you know, economically here in the UniteStates, but worldwide--I mean, as the report indicated, if there was just one explosive device detectein any one container that came into our ports, it basically woulbring the whole shipping industry to its knees, not to mention the effects it woulhave worldwide with 21,000 containers coming into our ports each anevery day.	N
It woulseem to me that we woulwant to accelerate the timetable for these vulnerability assessments.	N
With--43 percent goes into Long Beach anLos Angeles alone, in terms of our cargo shipments--it woulseem to me that we woulmake this the highest priority, to evaluate these assessments anto move quickly to address the gaps in the system.	N
Well, this report went on to say that very small amounts have been given so far, with respect to this issue, in grants.	N
I mean, even for--Los Angeles anLong Beach, which receives 43 percent of the shipments, in the year 2001 receivea grant of $6.1 million.	N
But I think we woulwant to be appriseif we are not giving sufficient amount of money to make sure that port security is being pursueaggressively in what we neeto do in order to close these vulnerability gaps.	N
Another recommendation in this report is on--in talking about--ancertainly my border, in Maine, with Canada, anone of the longest, if not the longest, with Canada--we have many remote locations.	N
Because obviously, that is important to the local residents, to be able to have use of those areas, but at the same time, we want to make sure that they are secure.	N
I know that the U.S. anCanada signelast month the U.S./Canada Smart Border Declaration, anI think that is moving, certainly, in the right direction.	N
I hope we can accelerate that timetable, as well--but also to be useas a standard, international standard, for other international organizations.	N
Overall, in terms of the magnitude of your responsibilities--they certainly coulnot be greater when you are thinking of what you are enjoining, in terms of the agencies antheir jurisdictions--are certainly varied.	N
I woulhope that you woulmake sure to conduct an audit of all the things that really neeto be done sooner rather than later anshare that with the Committee so that we can help you to meet your responsibilities under the law, anto help you organizationally, as well.	N
You know, I know that there is no question that your paramount challenge is the organization issue, anmaking sure that the bureaucracy functions in a way that does not allow lapses that obviously violate our security in this country.	N
Anas far as the Coast Guaris concerned, again I certainly--I know that you will have a gooworking relationship with the Coast Guard, working hand-in-glove, as I saiearlier, but also to ensure that there are not any operational or jurisdictional disputes that they can--because obviously the Coast Guaris going to play a premier role in ensuring our homelansecurity.	N
If I might just say, Mr. Hutchinson, the watch list is available to the Immigration Service.	N
So presumably, someone trying to cross the border from Canada into the U.S. woulbe able to get through the Immigration Service by avoiding them, going ten miles west or east on some country road.	N
Anthen ten miles south of that border at Pembina, North Dakota, although the immigration service hathe information ten miles north of the border, ten miles south, the highway patrol or the county sheriff will not have access to that information.	N
You are quite correct, the NCIC has been improved, but it does not, at this point, consist of the names of terrorists or known terrorists who are on the watch list.	N
That watch list is not perfect, you are correct about that, as well, but it is the only comprehensive list that we have made that describes terrorists who we know are terrorists, those who we suspect are terrorists.	N
Anagain, the top recommendation, the top priority, of the Rudman-Hart report was to correct this anto correct it quickly.	N
AnI have been raising this issue for some months, anregrettably, I see very little progress.	N
AnI am hearteneby your selection, because I think you are someone who can get something done, anthat is why I wanteto come anmake this point.	D
Every law-enforcement official across this country deserves to know if they have got someone in the car in front of them that they have just stoppewho is a known terrorist anon a list that this country has.	N
It desperately short-changes them anrisks their lives, anpromotes great risk for this country by not putting in the hands of 650,000 law-enforcement people that information.	N
I am sorry I was delayetoday, anI hope the Chairman recognizes that I hato be on the floor of the Senate.	N
We lost Senator Pryor to the ArmeServices Committee, where he was sitting in a very similar position; and, therefore, we were unable to retain him.	N
He is somebody that we're very, very prouof in Michigan, as CEO anpresident of the Kellogg Company.	N
It's on a very strong financial footing, for many reasons; particularly, the community that it is centralizeanlocalizein, but also because of his leadership.	N
His experience in running various parts of the Kellogg Company across this globe will help him to be a tremendous Secretary of Commerce.	D
He came to the UniteStates when he was 7 years old, anhis first job with Kellogg's was delivering cereal from a van, stocking the shelves, I believe, in Mexico, anworking himself up from there so that, during his career with Kellogg's, he has manageseveral international divisions, including general manager of Kellogg of Mexico, president anCEO of Kellogg Canada, president of Kellogg Asia Pacific.	N
Anthis vast business experience in the UniteStates anabroahas given him a unique understanding of our country's role anthe challenges that we face in the global marketplace.	D
Anhe also, in addition to coming from mid-America, the Heartlanof America, in a mid-sizetown, Battle Creek, he understands the values of mid-America anthe value of harwork.	D
He also understands some of the challenges that we face in the manufacturing sectors of America, because--Kellogg being, of course, a major manufacturer.	D
AnI do also want to clarify--when Senator Levin talks about ``cornflakes,'' it is ``Kellogg Corn Flakes'' that we are speaking about here.	N
But I am very pleaseto be here to support the nomination anpresent to you a fellow Michiganian as our next Secretary of Commerce.	N
As you have hearon many occasions, his impressive backgrounreveals a shining example of an individual who came to America, to our nation of immigrants, anenjoyea very real opportunity to pursue the American Dream, which he continues to pursue today.	D
I wish to join my Chairman in welcoming you, Mr. Gutierrez, to your first appearance before this Committee.	N
You may not be aware of this, but it's through sheer determination that we're meeting today.	N
As he notein his opening statement, he saithat it is critical that the Department play an active role in linking businesses with market opportunities throughout the world, supporting our companies where needed, and, I think, ensuring that the Department's role in our embassies is expanded.	N
AnI look forwarto working with you on these anmany other important matters within the Department's jurisdiction.	N
As you've noted, Mr. Gutierrez, in the past 2 weeks we've seen photos after photos of devastation, death, anmisery throughout the Indian Ocean area.	N
Anliving in an islanstate in the midst of volcanic activity, such as Hawaii, the people of Hawaii are very well aware of the destructive power of tsunamis.	N
Anthe Chairman, who is from Alaska, is also familiar with the threats poseby earthquakes antsunamis to our coastal communities.	N
Anthat's why we have worketogether very closely, throughout the many years, to increase our support for the funding of NOAA's tsunami warning program, including warning sensors in Hawaii anAlaska.	N
And, as you are well aware, 85 percent of all the tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean area, anwe spenabout $10 million annually for the Pacific system.	N
AnI'm assurethat the expansion will be completed, not next year, but in the next 7 years, anI think that is not acceptable, with what is happening out there.	N
assure that our Department has adequate resources to address this matter anfulfil your many other important responsibilities.	N
Anin lieu of making an opening statement, I wouljust like to submit my preparestatement for the record.	N
One is about broadband, specifically about broadband, getting broadbanout into rural America.	N
AnI'just like to get your thoughts on any plans or proposals or ideas you have to try to get broadbanout into rural America.	N
Anthe seconquestion I have, again, relates to one of the President's policies--anone of your predecessor, Don Evans, policies--about the steel industry.	N
In December of 2003, President Bush made the determination to extenthat program--along with Secretary Evans.	N
But, as I understanit, as of today, the Commerce Department has not adopteregulations to extenthe program.	N
Anthat's an important industry to a lot of different states in the UniteStates, but I think it's an important industry to the American economy.	N
Baseon the fact that we will be confirmeby the time we vote on this nomination on the floor, anwe will vote off the floor on reporting the nominee, I want to put in the recornow a motion that the Secretary--that the nomination be recommendeto the floor for confirmation.	N
I have a whole series of written questions, which I wish to submit, as well as the ones that I'll ask today.	N
And, you know, people who have not been sworn in as Committee Members, or whatever, the--approveby the Senate as Committee Members--can't vote.	N
I suppose that'll happen tomorrow, but I doubt that I'll get the answers to my questions tomorrow, anI've never been through a hearing, that I can remember, where I've votein favor of somebody who hasn't respondeto written questions.	N
Anso, my approach woulbe that I woulhave to vote no in Committee, if you're going to do that today, anthen hopefully wait until the Secretary-designate answerethe questions.	N
Anit's my understanding that we'll not be here after Friday, anthe first time we'll be back will be January 20th.	N
I hope you get your questions by that time, because we'll vote after the first vote on the floor.	N
I want to re-emphasize what I tolyou in private--is that, before this job is over for you, you will know more about fish than cornflakes.	N
As you're aware, I think, from our conversation, the largest trade case in American history is between the UniteStates anCanada on the soft woolumber issue.	N
I'm hoping that you will tell me that those duties will not be surrendereuntil they are part of a negotiatesettlement.	N
It's very important, anit's in the interest of Canada anthe UniteStates that we negotiate a settlement so that this industry, on both sides of the border, can survive.	N
Anthese duties that are being collecteare an important--a very important part of that negotiatesettlement.	N
On the issue of piracy, Mr. Gutierrez, America's copyright industry generates some 12 percent of American GDP, anaccount for over 8 percent of the total U.S. employment.	N
Specifically, the four copyright categories are movies, music, publishing, ansoftware--computer software.	N
They account for over $90 billion in foreign sales anexports--more than agriculture, more than automobiles, anmore than aircraft.	N
Anthere are just untolnumbers of people whose jobs are in jeopardy because of the amount of theft that is occurring overseas on American copyrightematerials.	N
Anso, I don't know if you have a comment on that, but I raise this issue, because I think it's so important to highlight to the Department of Commerce that we vigorously pursue piracy issues, specifically with China, specifically with Russia, where we have lost billions.	N
Pretty soon our entertainers are going to be on street corners with monkey-grinders, trying to get people to pay them.	N
But, ultimately, if we lose copyright issues, we're going to lose a great anvaluable part of the American economy.	N
Gutierrez, I understanthat China is on the verge of releasing government procurement regulations for China that will have the effect of barring most U.S. soft-wooproducts from being solin China.	N
You're here at a historic moment, not only for you, but for this Committee, as well, because it is a--I don't want to use the term ``reformed''--restructureCommittee.	N
AnI welcome our new colleagues, not as joyously as I might have haif they were sitting on this side of the aisle----	N
And, Mr. Gutierrez, I woulthink that you'have to note that Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, anI are among the more mature Members here, anwe, the three of us, servein WorlWar II.	N
We are, I think, the last ones to have been active during the perioin the--in this Senate.	N
In many instances through this body, we've met people who similarly--I was born of immigrant parents, anhaa fortunate ansomewhat lucky business career before coming here, so I respect greatly what you've accomplished, from the--	N
Anwe're going to look to you, Mr. Gutierrez, for a response that I notein your comments, anthat was that you hopeto bridge the boundaries, anyou included, in there, political, economic, et cetera.	N
We sometimes have disagreements that ought to be able to be dealt with in a more comprehensive fashion, anI hope that you'll help us.	N
This department, this Committee, has an enormous array of items that we work with, anyou'll have a chance to hear about them anlearn about them, angoing from the communications side to the marine side to the trade anbusiness side.	N
Anwhen I look at where we are, Mr. Gutierrez, I don't understanwhat it is that has us with a dollar that's so cheap compareto other currencies.	N
What has to happen with our products that are solat these very relatively low prices anstill don't enable us to gain a favorable trade balance?	N
So those are among the things that--and, Mr. Chairman, I woulask that my full statement be includein the record.	N
AnI wouljust ask this one question of Mr. Gutierrez, anthat is, If the dollar continues to fall, woulit be your view that it's either gooor bafor the economy?	N
Senator, I have a lot to learn about Washington anabout how our business is conductehere.	N
One thing I have learneis that the only two people who speak on behalf of the currency, or about the currency, are the Secretary of the Treasury anthe President.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman anRanking Member, anthank you for the warm welcome to the Committee.	N
One of the problems has been that, within our own bureaucracy, the rate of properly imposing those is under 20 percent; whereas, the overall rate, in terms of proper tariff enforcement by our own people--I'm talking about our government--is over 95 percent.	N
Anwe've been pushing anpushing anpushing Customs anothers to get our act together to fix that.	N
There have been recent decisions that have confirmethat there's dumping--illegal dumping of foreign shrimp, anwe're moving to responto that.	N
But, again, some of this process takes so long that if you're a small business, which every Louisiana shrimper is, it doesn't matter if it happens 5 years from now.	N
I'also like to touch on NOAA, which is very important to my part of the world, in the Gulf of Mexico.	N
I'm a strong supporter of NOAA, anit does a lot of important things, including pure science anresearch, but it also does some very appliethings, which are important, like survey work in Alaska, in the Gulf of Mexico, elsewhere.	N
I'm a big supporter of making sure we get that survey work done, because it's not several steps removefrom commerce; it is directly relateto commerce, certainly in the Gulf.	N
AnI'just like your reaction to that, anyour thoughts on that enof, sort of, the NOAA spectrum of work.	N
science enis often the, sort of, ``sexy'' enthat gets attention anmoney, anthe applieensometimes gets short shrift.	N
Anthings like routine updating of surveys of the Gulf anthe waters off Alaska anelsewhere is very important for maritime commerce.	N
Also, I'm a strong supporter of getting the most bang for the buck for that sort of work, however the chips may fall, whether it's a government-ownevessel or whether it's contracting out to private firms.	N
AnI woulencourage you to use no test, other than what is going to get the taxpayer the most bang for the buck.	N
In survey work, it's pretty simple, in terms of, you know, How much surveying are you going to be able to do for X amount of dollars?	N
Anthat also translates, ultimately, into how much political support we have for trade, because if we don't have reasonable enforcement in a reasonable amount of time, ansmall business is hurt every step of the way, obviously----	N
As you know, my predecessor, Senator Hollings, from South Carolina, servemany years, anI don't know if I can serve as many, but I look forwarto serving with all of you.	N
As I understanthe protocol from your opening statement, you have to still approve me as a--or confirm me as a Member before we confirm you as Chairman before we confirm Mr. Gutierrez----	N
AnI likea lot of the things you said, particularly about fostering a better business environment in this country.	N
As I visit businesses all over the country, particularly in South Carolina, I hear more anmore about the burden of costs anregulation antaxes anliability that comes from being a U.S.-basemanufacturer, particularly.	N
Anas a producer, yourself, for many years, doing business internationally, I'just like to hear you talk a little bit about how we can make American business more competitive, ancut the costs of doing business in this country, anmake this the best place in the worlto do business.	N
AnI'm sure, in your role at Kellogg, many times you've said, ``If I was in Washington, this is what I wouldo, this is what I woulchange.''	N
AnI'just love to hear you just talk a few minutes, generally, about what you think we neeto focus on here in the Senate, in the Congress, the President, anwhat you wouldo, in the Department of Commerce, to make America the best place in the worlto do business.	N
Anif I couljust echo some of the things we've heard, as far as trade, I'm from a textile-producing state.	N
But the political support anjust the pragmatism of trade really only exists if we're going to enforce our agreements, if we're going to protect our copyrights anour patents.	N
AnI think if there's one thing we neefrom the Commerce Department more than anything else, is a level, balanceplaying fielarounthe world, anjust gooenforcement, so we can do business everywhere in the worlwith--anon a fair basis.	N
Have you determinewhether you woulrecuse yourself on sugar issues if, in fact, you haa decisionmaking authority there?	N
On another issue, then--Senator Ashcroft anI passea piece of legislation, that has become law, that allows, for the first time in 40-some years, us to sell agricultural products into the Cuban marketplace for cash.	N
The Department of the Treasury is now taking an exceptional anunusual interpretation of the language of the law, antrying to do everything they can to impede anstop the legitimate sale, under current law, of agricultural commodities to Cuba.	N
You talkeabout wanting to reduce the barriers anburdens of our ability to sell overseas.	N
There are proposals by the USTR, that we woulbe willing to negotiate away our anti-dumping provisions.	N
We don't have the backbone or the will or the steel to employ them hardly at all, ever, but negotiating them away is fundamentally folly, in my judgment, for this country.	N
I direceive a call from Mr. Canales, who, I believe, woulbe my counterpart in Mexico if I am confirmeansworn in.	N
But I can assure you I dinot make any commitments on behalf of the Administration or the U.S. Government, knowing that I have not been confirmeas Secretary of Commerce.	N
I mean, that is--that's very, very--it's a marvelous thing, an emotional, marvelous tribute to, obviously, a strong man.	N
I don't mean to holanything up, anit would--I will probably enup voting for you, but I do want to get the answers to some questions that I will submit to you, anthey're--anthey won't be, I don't think, particularly difficult.	N
Ansteel--there's a big question there--ansteel, to some people, is, kinof, a subject which has passeus by.	N
I remember talking with a former--member of a former Administration, a Democratic Administration, anI talkeabout the fact that free-trade--I mean, you made mention that you've got to have gootrade-remedy laws, in an answer to Senator Dorgan.	N
Ansomehow, free trade anfree-trade remedies anthe holding on to--not weakening the laws at Doha, et cetera, which our current USTR Ambassador promiseme, anthen, within 3 months, was giving them away, negotiating them away--that's very, very serious in West Virginia, where our unemployment is very high, anwhere only 4 percent of the lanis flat, anwhere life is constantly hard.	N
There are many rural states here, anthat's why you're hearing about individual problems.	N
There are very few, sort of, states that have all kinds of opportunities, economic opportunities.	N
The Doha package is very important to me, anI want to know--although--that you will do everything in your power, as Secretary of Commerce, which I think you will become, to not negotiate any further trade-remedy laws away.	N
It's not a high-tech, in the usual sense--you know, the Silicon Valley sense--but, oh, there are so many people that work for it for generations, anthen they come out, antheir retirement is gone, their pension is gone, their health benefits, gone, everything is gone.	N
Anwhen that was--when some of these changes were made, in 2002, the Congress passea TAA, which--a reform act, which saithat up to 65 percent of the cost of health insurance woulbe borne anavailable to the employees.	N
Now, what's interesting is that only 6 percent of the employees that this affects have taken advantage of that, which is shocking, in a sense, but it means that the 65 percent doesn't do the job.	N
Anthe thinking, generally arounhere is, it's got to be 95 percent if it's going to do the job.	N
But the 6 percent thing, I wish you woullook into why--why is it so little, when healthcare costs--these, of course, are much older people, people who have been injured, et cetera, anI woullike to hear, at some point, your thoughts on that question.	N
Also--anmy time is about up--when the President put in the existing Steel Import Monitoring Program, there was a--that was also, at the same time, a Section 201 pass, which was temporary relief for steel.	N
And, at that time, Secretary Evans, your predecessor, stated, unequivocally, that the existing program woulbe expandeto additional steel products, anmade indefinite in duration.	N
AnI woulhope that you woulcommit yourself, to the extent that you can, that this program woulcontinue.	N
AnI welcome our new Members to the Committee, anthank Mr. Gutierrez for being here, and, moreover, thank him for the service that he will be performing for our country.	N
So thank you anyour family for your patriotism anyour service anleadership aninsights you'll be providing to us and, obviously, the President and, ultimately, benefiting the American people.	D
I'm one, Mr. Gutierrez, that believes that we neeto do everything we can to make sure that this country is more competitive, more desirable for investment anjob creation.	N
That means our tax policies, regulatory policies, research, education--all neeto make sure that every American has a better ability to compete ansucceeinternationally.	N
Anso, many of the issues that have been brought up here by some of my colleagues are important in that regard.	N
Trade agreements are important, but they neeto be enforced, So I'm glato hear your comments.	N
It'll be important that you work with our trade representatives to enforce when China is cheating in a variety of areas, whether it's intellectual property, whether that's software or other matters, furniture, textiles, or semiconductor chips.	N
If we're going to have trade agreements, those contracts neeto be enforced, anenforcequickly.	N
This will be necessary if we're going to continue to try to have the support of the American people for trade agreements as a net-plus.	N
Trade adjustment assistance is important, understanding that there are some folks that are hurt by international treaties, trade agreements.	N
AnI'm one who's been advocating making sure that folks don't lose their homes, have a transition for mortgages for 12 months so they don't lose their homes as they're retraining anfinding another job.	N
One thing we've done on the Foreign Relations Committee, to Senator Smith's comments on intellectual property anpiracy, is provide$5 million to help train anenforce copyright or intellectual property rights, anmake sure those countries are enforcing them, because it's pretty harfor us to do it in another country if they don't care about it there.	N
Anone issue we're going to bring up here is the whole Telecommunications Act angetting that thing up to date so that broadbanwill be available.	N
It is the way that small businesses in small towns anrural areas can communicate, conduct business, get education aninformation.	N
Your predecessor was helpful in my efforts to make sure that the Internet was not taxewith access taxes--on average of about 18 percent, if the state anlocal commissars have their way.	N
Can you give us assurance that you'll continue to be in favor of keeping the Internet free of Internet access taxes, no matter which platform one receives broadband, whether it's by DSL, satellite, over power lines, or wireless?	N
Good, because I think the people who woulbe hurt the most by taxes on broadbanwoulbe, clearly, those of lower income, as well as smaller jurisdictions.	N
One other measure--that I've workeon--anthis Committee has passed, for the knowledge of some of the new Members--is a measure to upgrade the technology capabilities at minority-	N
serving institutions, higher education--whether they're historically black colleges anuniversities, tribal universities, or Hispanic-serving institutions--to upgrade their technology so those students have the faculty, the training, the education to get the goojobs, 60 percent of which require technological proficiency.	N
We got it through the Senate; we've got to get it through the House anget the Administration onboard.	N
But coulyou share with me any experiences that you've haas a leader of the Kellogg Company, insofar as working with minority-serving institutions?	D
Is your wonderful bride, Edilia, anyour children going to be moving with you, if you are so-confirmed?	N
I want to welcome you, Mr. Gutierrez, anam looking forwarto working with you in the future.	N
Certainly, the Commerce Department has a number of issues that are vital, not only to my own constituency in Maine, but throughout this country.	N
And, certainly, that is--been one of my major areas of concern for some time, since I've been in both the House anSenate, particularly from the standpoint that our government has faileto aggressively enforce our trade laws.	N
Anyou're in a prime position, given your very impressive personal history anyour entrepreneurial abilities, anbeing a skilleleader ancorporate executive, in how to create jobs anto buila business, anI think that entrepreneurial spirit will be absolutely vital at a time when we're confronting monumental change in our own economy.	D
As others have mentionehere, you know, we have had, obviously, huge disparities with respect to trade, unfair trade subsidies.	N
Whereas, you probably know, there are more than 2.7 million jobs that have been lost in the manufacturing segment of our economy; and, in Maine over the last 4 years, 17,600 jobs.	N
AnI woulencourage you to review the--Congress createa commission, the U.S.-China Economic anSecurity Review Commission, anit recently issuea report.	N
Anit was--that examination indicated, very specifically anexplicitly, that the U.S. was failing to vigilantly protect intellectual property rights.	N
Anit also saithat we were not properly addressing China's illegal trade subsidies, and, of course, the unfair manipulation of its currency, the yuan.	N
But it's all, I think, intertwineto the problems that we're facing that has undermineour manufacturing sector unfairly.	N
So, I woulhope you wouluse your leadership anyour abilities anyour knowledge to fight these issues anto challenge our trading partners, where they are trading illegally, unfairly, analso holding our WTO members accountable to the commitments that they're requireto make.	D
And, certainly, that has been the case with China in the past, anthat's why we've got this enormous record-high trade deficit.	N
It all goes back to the domestic manufacturing sector that has paia very steep price for this unfairness.	N
You know, the President created, for the first time ever, a manufacturing czar, an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, anthat was recently filleas a position, anI woulhope that you woulwork with the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Frink, to work on these issues, to open up markets, to help, as others have indicatehere, to reduce the structural costs to manufacturers so that they can remain competitive anto keep that competitive edge.	N
So, I woulhope that you wouluse the auspices of this position to do all that you can to enforce these agreements.	N
AnI also woulcertainly point out that one program within the Commerce Department is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program--	N
it's now the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership--anthat program is vital to manufacturers.	N
AnI was very concernethat that program was cut--in fact, from, like, 106 million in 2004, to 39 million.	N
It's sort of counterintuitive, at a time in which we're creating a new position for Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing, we were cutting the program that provides the very tools anexpertise to manufacturers in our country.	N
We now have restoreit to its proper funding level, but I understanthe Administration's budget might contain another severe cut, anI think that's the wrong direction, the wrong message at a time in which our manufacturers have been hurting as a result of all the issues that I have raised.	N
Another area--because I know my time will be expiring, so can I shift from lanto sea--I have chairethe Ocean, Fisheries, anCoast GuarSubcommittee.	N
AnI woulcommenyou, as well, to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy anthe 212 recommendations that they have made.	N
Anto use your leadership to begin to work with the Committee anthe Congress to systematically implement those recommendations, where we can, to finthe funding on those critical issues, because it is evermore important.	D
In fact, I do believe that we shoulcreate a national global warning system, ocean observing anwarning system.	N
AnI have establisheone in the State of Maine, anI have recommended, anthe Commission has recommended, creating a national system.	N
I know there's a Pacific warning system, anI've haconcerns about NOAA, anI have expressethat recently, after the devastating tsunami, where they dinot contact officials in other countries.	N
They dicontact Australia, anAustralia contacteIndonesia when there were signs of this impending tsunami in the Indian Ocean.	N
I realize it's a Pacific warning system, but I think we have to work through those issues to see how we can set up an observation system that will work.	N
Anthis global warning system can work in that regard, not only for monitoring the sea, but also to provide these indications.	N
AnI'm delighteto be here this afternoon, with you presiding for the first time over this Committee.	N
I want to say how prouI am to have the new Members, anI've already been visiting, on both sides of the aisle, anI've been assurethat the gentleman from Arkansas is going to be voting with me more over the next 2 years than he dithe previous years.	N
Anwe congratulate you on your nomination, anwe extento your family, sitting behinyou, our thanks for their willingness to sacrifice so that you can do this job.	N
Anwith your predecessor, every time I got a letter from him, or sent one, there was always a fish drawn at the bottom of the letter.	N
But the problem is, at Commerce, you've got so many things you're going to be dealing with, important issues, that sometimes fisheries sort of fall off the enof the table.	N
I was afraiwe wouldn't hear any more about Gulf shrimp, but--with John Breaux gone--but I'm reassurethat I've got an ally here, anam making the point to you that fisheries are in the Gulf, not just in the Northeast anthe Northwest.	N
I also join my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, anparticularly the new Senator from South Carolina, on the trade issue.	N
Like most of them, I have voteconsistently for all the trade agreements--GATT, NAFTA, China agreement, all of them--	N
but I do think that we've got to also use common sense, anwe've got to make sure that they are--our trading partners are fair in their treatment andealings with us.	N
One point, though, that I don't believe has been raised, anthat's with regarto the new partnership callethe U.S. A-Team.	N
This is directeat improving competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry, anit--but it only includes--it includes just--	N
basically, Ford, General Motors, anDaimlerChrysler, but not other foreign companies that have significant domestic activity.	N
Anthat could--you know, that includes, obviously, Nissan anHonda anToyota and--well, Mercedes is DaimlerChrysler.	N
I'like you to take a look at this anmake sure that we are approaching this right, that we don't penalize companies that are creating jobs andoing significant business in this country.	N
To include one foreign company, but not others that are doing this domestic work, I believe is a mistake, anI hope that you will look at that.	N
I look forwarto voting for your nomination anconfirmation, anto working with you in the next 4 years.	N
We've talked, already, about a number of issues, when you anI hathe opportunity to sit down.	N
Because since we haour personal visit, anI tolyou about the fact that Brazil, if it were to have the tariff eliminateon Florida citrus, woulnot become free trade; it woulbecome monopoly trade.	N
But since then, in late December, as reporteby the Wall Street Journal, the Brazilians are still up to no good.	N
They are dumping, on the market, both frozen concentrate, at 37 percent less than production costs, anselling pasteurizenot-from-concentrate juice at 78 percent lower than production costs.	N
The Commerce Department is going to weigh in on these kinds of things, anI just want to underscore to you what we hatalkeabout before.	N
And, as a matter of fact, I was flying off the southern coast of Cuba, as we hasurroundeHurricane Charley, as it was moving to the northwest, dropping those instruments that gave realtime data that, then, we collecteon the airplane anbeameit by satellite back to the National Hurricane Center, anhas given us the opportunity for very accurate forecasting.	N
I think Senator Snowe mentionethat it was actually the NOAA Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii that pickeup the earthquake off Indonesia, but they didn't have the buoys out there to know where the tsunami was going.	N
Anthen, in your Department, you have the National Telecommunications anInformation Administration that oversees Federal Government spectrum usage of the electromagnetic spectrum.	N
We simply neeto relieve some of the spectrum that now, with digital, can be combineand--do what with it?	N
We have battlehere on this Committee, because there are powerful entities that we are battling.	N
Anyet, for the gooof the country, we're going to have to do that, anwe're going to have to accommodate all these people in the telecommunications industry.	N
Eventually, we're going to have to address the intellectual property issue with regarto other countries, particularly China.	N
That means a great deal to our country anto its ability to compete in the world, anthat's going to be in your sphere of influence, as well.	N
I enjoyeour brief conversation the other evening, anI look forwarto working with you.	N
Nebraska's economy, as is the case with many economies in the Midwest, is driven by agricultural annon-agricultural trade, especially as it pertains to exports to other parts of the world.	N
I doubt that you expecteto talk as much about trade today as, perhaps, you have, given the fact that Ambassador Zoellick gets an earful, as well, about the challenges we have with trade, the growing deficit that we have in so many parts of the world, particularly with the People's Republic of China; the weak dollar anhow that is supposeto work to our benefit, but it gets peggeby other currency and, therefore, there is no major advantage; the European barriers, which I suspect you may know first hand, coming from the food-	N
processing anpackaging andistribution industry, as it relates to the genetically modifieorganisms anall the other ways that the Europeans seem to have not to import our agricultural products.	N
Anyou probably have receivean earful about the importance of free trade combinewith fair trade, so that we do have the ability to throw a flag when there's a--	N
where there's an infraction, to try to get something resolveas quickly as we possibly can.	N
Having set that up as a background, without setting you up, do you have any particular thoughts about what you might do to work with Ambassador Zoellick, within the Administration, anwith this Committee anothers, to try to resolve some of the major disputes, such as with the European trading partners, perhaps with Canada ansome of the areas that we challenge there.	N
One big idea or something that might be able to give us some idea of what you have in mind.	N
As it relates to the currency, I suspect that Secretary Snow has some interest in that, anyou'll have the opportunity to work with him.	N
But we were all tolthat a weak dollar woulbe goofor exports from America, because the high value of the other currency shoulbe able to buy more.	N
As it relates to balance of trade, as you look to the future, because of the importance of exports from America, particularly as it relates to manufacturegoods, do you have any thoughts about steel prices?	N
But the challenge that we have right now with the steel prices in the U.S. versus steel prices elsewhere, anthe outsourcing anthe offshoring of jobs----	N
Mr. Chairman, before proceeding with my questions, I'like to, most respectfully, suggest to the Secretary-designee that when Chairman Stevens invites you to Alaska, there's only one answer:----	N
CoulI inquire of the Senator from Hawaii, maybe a trip with the Secretary to your state woulbe in order.	N
Anwe woulask that you respond, to the questions that have been submitteto you, by Friday, if it's possible, Mr. Secretary.	N
Mr. Gutierrez, I've hathe high privilege anthe great honor of serving in the Congress for--since 1949--1959, I'm sorry--anin the Senate for 42 years.	N
Anin that period, I've hathe opportunity to work with Cabinet Secretaries, appointees of several Presidents.	N
Anall of them woulhave resumes speaking highly of their academic accomplishments, doctorate from Harvard, or a Ph.D. from some other place, Oxforanall of this.	N
Anall the appointees that I've sat through on their hearings of this nature, you're the only appointee that I know of who has no college degree.	N
What makes your backgrounsuch that you believe woulwell serve the country as Secretary of Commerce?	N
AnI know that it's quite un-senatorial to announce your decision before decision-time, but I'm prepareto cast my vote in your favor at this moment.	N
I want to tell you that I serveas an assistant to a Cabinet Officer, Secretary of the Interior FreSeaton, who hano college degree.	N
So I feel sorry for your assistants, because I think you know how to work, anyou'll work the people arounyou as they shoulwork.	N
At the direction aninstructions of the Chair, I want to welcome all the nominees with us today anespecially the families.	N
You have a lot to be prouof, anI know that this is a very important day for all of you.	N
Anso I will place my statement on each nominee in the record, because I think we woullike to expedite the hearings.	N
I have come with my esteemecolleague, Senator Mikulski, to introduce a highly respecteleader in Maryland's scientific community, Dr. Michael Griffin, who is the President's nominee to serve as the next Administrator of NASA.	N
He has his Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics from the Johns Hopkins University, anhe has earnefive master's degrees; Aerospace Science from Catholic University, Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, AppliePhysics from Johns Hopkins, Civil Engineering from George Washington University, anBusiness Administration from Loyola College of Maryland.	D
He is currently the Space Department Heaof the Johns Hopkins University AppliePhysics Laboratory in HowarCounty, Maryland.	N
Johns Hopkins APL is a nonprofit division of the Johns Hopkins University, and, under the strong leadership of Dr. RicharRocca, serves as one of the premier research andevelopment institutions in the nation.	N
For almost 50 years, APL's Space Division has playea central role in supporting our nation's civilian anmilitary space programs.	N
The New York Times put it well in an editorial strongly supporting Dr. Griffin's nomination, entitlevery simply but appropriately, ``A TalenteLeader.''	N
He has hela number of leadership positions during his long career in both the public anprivate sectors.	D
They have demandean extraordinarily high level of both scientific excellence anadministrative capabilities.	N
Currently the heaof APL's Space Division, Mike Griffin oversees a staff of over 600 employees, ana budget well in excess of $200 million.	N
He has, of course, havery important experience at NASA in the upper echelons as both the Chief Engineer anthe Associate Administrator for Exploration.	D
In addition to his administrative anresearch interests, he has continueto do important academic work.	D
We think that the expertise anthe passion that Mike Griffin brings to the job is exactly what is needed.	N
I am very pleaseto come before the Committee today to very strongly endorse his nomination.	N
AnI very much hope the Committee can act expeditiously anfavorably on this nomination.	N
Annot only does he, in fact, bring the credentials to the table that he is, in fact, a rocket scientist, he carries himself with great humility.	D
I am here really under two flags: One, the prouflag of Maryland, talking about one of Maryland's favorite sons, Dr. Mike Griffin, to be nominatefor the NASA Administrator, anthen the other as the Ranking Member on the Senate Appropriations Committee who has responsibility for the funding of NASA programs.	N
I want to thank President Bush for nominating such an outstanding candidate to heaup NASA at this time of great strategic importance for NASA's future analso the fact that the NASA Administrator has to deal with the long-range plans anthe short-range crises that we are now facing.	D
Under the Marylanflag, as Senator Sarbanes said, Mike Griffin is really a hometown guy, coming from Aberdeen, the home of Cal Ripken, Jr.	D
What is important about that is he brings those, what we call, those Ripken values, that Ripken way, to NASA.	N
To be the best of what you best can be anto work harat it, to concentrate with a high level andegree of competence, but at the same time to put values into action, playing by the rules, serving your community, anbeing an outstanding citizen.	N
He has five master's degrees in a variety of engineering anphysics, analso even an MBA from Loyola College.	D
Thank Gothat we are really going to have someone who understands what this is all about.	D
Because the very safety of our astronauts will depenon the quality of this NASA Administrator, as we get ready to return to flight.	N
Much has been made over the fact that he workeat the Johns Hopkins AppliePhysics Lab, heading their Space Department, knowing what earth science means, knowing what space science means, anknowing what it means to be a contractor anto meet the bottom line while serving the nation.	D
I am delighteanprouto introduce someone who is not a rocket scientist, but an expert on transportation anadministration, to the Committee.	D
We have workeclosely together on many transportation projects in New York State, anI think he will do a great job at FRA.	D
AnI recommenhim wholeheartedly, as does my colleague, Senator Clinton, who coulnot be here today.	N
Joe has been the heaof the New York State Department of Transportation for the last 7 years.	D
He made a lifetime of working to make all modes of New York's transportation system safer anmore efficient.	D
He has workehis way up from being manager of both the Transportation anParking Authorities of Rome, New York, to Commissioner of Public Transportation in Broome County, in which Binghamton lies, to finally becoming the Commissioner of Transportation in 1997.	D
AnNew York has one of the largest anmost complex transportation systems in the country.	N
Throughout these experiences, Commissioner Boardman showethat he possessethe unique knowledge of how essential, safe, fast, aneasily accessible transportation is vital to local communities anto economic growth of entire states, regions, anacross the country.	D
I am prouto say that, as Commissioner, Joe has expandeAmtrak service across New York, presiding over recorgrowth in ridership.	D
He has enhancehis department's ability to inspect ancrack down on rail safety violations anmade safety a top priority.	D
Before I sat down with the Commissioner anspoke with him, he assureme he woulfight harfor Amtrak.	D
We all know that is going to be a big, big fight in the Senate this year anin the budget.	N
Anfurthermore, with the recent revelations of safety lapses in our rail system, particularly our freight rail system, he has assureme he woulfocus on that.	D
I am prouto endorse his nomination anintroduce him to this very, very special Committee.	N
Senator Inouye, distinguisheCommittee Members, it gives me great pleasure anit is indeean honor to support this morning Bill Cobey, nominateto serve as a member of the Washington Airports Authority Board.	N
Bill has demonstratea long andedicatecommitment to public service over the years for our Home State of North Carolina anour nation.	D
Without a doubt, one of the most rewarding anchallenging projects I chose to undertake while serving as Secretary of Transportation was the task of moving National anDulles International Airports out of the Federal Government.	N
I will never forget the night in 1984 when my husbananI were having a little pillow talk, Senator Inouye.	N
I later founthat Bob was absolutely correct in predicting the journey to regional control woulbe a very tough one indeed.	N
But after 3 years of dedicateeffort from a very talenteteam anthe help of you, Senator Inouye, another Committee Members, it passeboth houses of Congress anwas signeinto law by President Reagan.	D
In 1987, independent operation of Washington's two airports became a successful partnership.	N
The airports were able to raise the necessary funds through sales of tax-free bonds to provide for the capital improvements anexpansions.	N
Today, Washington's two airports serve 39 million passengers annually with 1,069 daily flights to over 100 destinations throughout the UniteStates an36 countries worldwide.	N
It is the responsibility of the Washington Airports Authority Boarto oversee the airports antheir security, safety, development anmaintenance.	N
I commenthe boarfor their excellence in handling the more than 100,000 passengers who use the two airports on a daily basis.	N
AnSenator Inouye, I thank you for your harwork in making that bill a bipartisan effort, which has indeemade air travel to anfrom our nation's capital far easier anless expensive.	D
I know that Bill Cobey will be a wonderful asset, will do a great job as an addition to the Airports Authority Board.	N
Bill has servehis state annation in many different capacities, anhe has an outstanding list of accomplishments.	D
He receivehis undergraduate education from Emory University in Atlanta anthen earnean MBA from the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania anan M.Ed. in health anphysical education from the University of Pittsburgh.	D
Prior to representing North Carolina in the U.S. Congress, Bill serveas Governor Jim Martin's Deputy Secretary of Transportation anlater as Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environment, Health, anNatural Resources.	D
A devotehusband, father angrandfather, Bill is a man I am prouto call my friend, a man of tremendous character, a man committeto making our country better.	D
I thank you for this opportunity to express my admiration anrespect for Bill Cobey, Mr. Chairman, anto present him to the Committee.	N
I am prouto be here today representing North Carolina, the home of this year's collegiate basketball champions and, as of last night, Miss USA.	N
AnI am here today to fully endorse his nomination to the boarof the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority.	N
It shoulbe notethat Bill was electeto the House of Representatives in 1984 anservewith Senators McCain, Lott, Snowe, Dorgan, anSenator Boxer, all current Members of the Commerce Committee, as Members of the House in the 98th Congress.	D
While Bill's well-documenteservice to our state ancountry as a Congressman, cabinet secretary in Raleigh, anpublic university advocate qualify him for a position on the Authority's board, I believe it will be his backgrounas an athletic director at one of the nation's most successful universities that will best serve the mission of the board.	D
Athletic directors are known for their tenacity in raising money ansupport for capital improvement projects.	N
Anhis success at the University of North Carolina anthe success of the school's athletic program anwhat it enjoys today are the direct result of capital campaigns undertaken by the school during his tenure as athletic director.	N
His wealth of knowledge in these endeavors andeep reserve of people skills will position the Authority well as it prepares current anfuture capital improvements at Reagan anDulles Airports.	D
Annow it is my pleasure to call upon the first panel, Dr. Michael Griffin, nominateto be Administrator of the National Aeronautics anSpace Administration, anMr. Joseph Boardman, nominateto be Administrator of the Federal RailroaAdministration.	N
As Chairman of the NASA anScience Subcommittee, I just want to say how pleaseI am with the nomination of Dr. Michael Griffin, because I think having his leadership, his expertise, his knowledge at this time when we are trying to get the return to flight anset NASA on its mission for the next 50 years, I think having a leader such as Michael Griffin will enable us to get a clear focus of where we want NASA to go.	D
We are going to have several hearings in our Committee to talk about the importance of the Shuttle, anthe Space Station.	N
But I do want to ask the Chairman anthe Ranking Member to consider trying to get Dr. Griffin's nomination out of the Senate this week.	N
Anhaving the, not permanent leader of NASA, but certainly the designateleader of NASA on boarby Monday woulhelp accomplish the return to flight on that timetable.	D
So Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can expedite his votes from the Committee anfurther have this on the Senate floor before we leave this week.	N
Anif you can honor Senator Hutchison's request to expedite this nomination to the floor so that he coulbe in place the beginning of next week, I think it woulserve the Nation well.	N
AnI ask, first of all, unanimous consent that my full statement woulbe put in the record.	N
Without objection, anSenator Schumer's statement introducing Mr. Boardman will appear, too.	N
Just in a short word, Mr. Chairman, we are fortunate to have the kinof candidates for these lofty positions that we do have.	N
AnI think fair to say that Amtrak anpassenger rail service is a primary concern of mine, not the only one.	N
But I am worried, Mr. Boardman, what might happen if Amtrak, for instance, stopperunning the Empire service from New York City to Niagara Falls or the Adirondack trains from New York City to Montreal.	N
Now, would--the city of New York--you have experience there--be prepareto pick up the costs to continue those operations?	N
Yes, but Mr. Boardman, you are aware of the fact that the recommendation by the President woulabolish much, if not all, of Amtrak's services.	N
AnI askeyou the question deliberately about the service on the two lines we were just discussing.	N
Is New York State--anyou saithat, you know, you saithat no state is going to step up voluntarily to do it.	N
The question is: With your unique experience in New York State anin railroading for such a long time, transportation, will New York State be able to fully take over the responsibility of running the railroafrom New York City on north in these two lines?	N
Well, is supporting with the money includeor supporting it in a philosophical kinof thing?	N
Because what we are looking at is a question of whether or not we have the resources to continue to provide this intercity passenger rail service.	N
So New York State, it is in your belief that New York State woulstep up anprovide all of the services that are presently there on their own, without assistance from Amtrak.	N
You might be able to run all kinds of things, but without the appropriate amount of fuel anresource, it cannot happen.	N
Now as Chairman of AASHTO's Standing Committee on Rail Transportation, you are responsible for the report that stressethe primary role of the Federal Government to ensure adequate funding for passenger rail.	N
Now, we have a zero proposal, a proposal of zero level for funding on passenger rail in this Fiscal Year 2006 budget.	N
But when you throw in a condition like that, when there has been so much cost reduction, personnel reduction anso forth.	N
How do you ensure that the freight railroads, for instance, will give reasonable scheduling priority so that the freight delays will not hamper passenger service, which often occurs?	N
So might we suggest that the same thing shoulbe done with Amtrak, to give them the kinof support that they need?	N
If it was a significant assist for the freight service, then why shoulwe not try to duplicate that for passenger rail service?	N
I am informethat we are now on the defense supplemental, anSenator Inouye anI may be called.	N
Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I am going to be brief, because our nominee for NASA is obviously the right person at the right time of leadership.	D
I am going to submit, with your permission, a number of detailequestions that I woullike to have for the record, as we, well, as Dr. Griffin leads this agency out of the wilderness.	N
I want to, if I may, just take a couple of moments here to have you state for the recorwhat we have already talkeabout in private--which I finyour views compelling--on such as using your ability in your new position to enable NASA to improve its decision-making process on, example, accepting certain risks before we return to flight.	N
AnI confirm your concern as a leader, that I have often felt that the last two tragedies that we have hain NASA, first Challenger anthen Columbia, although destruction for different technical reasons, really, it was a common theme.	D
Share with the Committee your concern about the potential hiatus where we woulbe without an American vehicle for human access to space perhaps in a situation for years relying upon the Russians anwhere the geopolitics woultake us in those years, that suddenly Russia might not be a reliable person, a reliable partner, for access to space, for human access to space.	N
Share your thoughts about that hiatus between the schedule of 2010, shutting down the Shuttle, anseveral years later possibly before we woulhave the crew exploration vehicle ready to go.	N
Mr. Chairman, I woulonly ask at some point in the nominee's testimony, if he might share his vision for the future of NASA, because I think we will hear a refreshing statement.	N
It is my understanding that the Senator's questions as submittefor the recorwoulnot be intendeto holup the confirmation process.	N
It has, as I have discussewith Dr. Griffin, been of great concern to me that we woulhave a 5-	N
I think it is, in addition to a potential problem in stopping the science that is done at the Shuttle, I mean at the Space Station, I think it is a security issue for our country when we are seeing, as you pointeout, other countries going into space.	N
Ancertainly when I am able to holour Subcommittee hearings, I will have you back, anwe will be able to discuss these things more fully.	N
But of the priorities that I have after return to flight, the 5-year hiatus is the biggest.	N
You saisomething in your opening statement that you support the Space Station, but we have to make sure that putting people in space is for a mission worthy of the risk.	N
But I want to make sure that we also have the commitment to our international partners to finish the Space Station anthat we look for the ways to enhance the science so that it is worthy of the efforts that we are making, both in the medical research, which we are now doing, anpotentially with geophysical research, from what we might get on the moon anthen maybe into the long-term future, Mars.	N
AnI just wanteto ask you if you are committeto finishing the Space Station anif you have other ideas about the kinds of science that we can do that woulbe worthy of the risk of mannespace flight.	N
So you can foresee that there coulbe equipment testing, as perhaps we go back anforth to the moon, that could--I mean, to--I am sorry, to the moon that coulalso eventually help us in knowing what it woultake to go to Mars? 	N
AnI was very pleaseto work on this with him because of a situation that happenein San Antonio, Texas, last year where--anit just--it happens in other parts of the country as well.	N
It just happenethat we haa huge wreck anit was going through a major metropolitan area.	N
Anwe know that hazardous materials carriage going through metropolitan areas is an issue that affects many communities.	N
Our bill woulrequire railroads to improve inspections of weldetrack, develop tank car safety standards, anask, or actually direct, the FRA to do a relevant rulemaking.	N
AnI just wanteto ask you if you are familiar with this issue anif you are committeto better inspection capabilities by the railroads anbetter oversight from the FRA analso the issue of tank car integrity.	N
Senators, I have urgethe staff to notify absent Senators, but we will meet in the President's room right after the next vote or at 2:15 today, whichever occurs first, on the nomination.	N
My time is short here so, Mr. Griffin, I woullike to focus some questions with you first.	N
Something that has been in the news recently is the Hubble Spacecraft, or the Hubble Telescope.	N
AnI am hearing, I guess, conflicting reports, or maybe I do not understanexactly what is going on.	N
I think that some are saying we shouljust pretty much abandon it anlet it die, anothers are saying no, we can senup some sort of robotic spacecraft anget it, you know, reworkefor a longer life.	N
In fact, as I understanit, NASA's auditors have not been able to conduct an audit for three of the last 4 years.	N
Anthe last question I wanteto ask is not so much about space flight or even agency but science aneducation.	N
Well, I tell you what, I will just write out a question for you for the record, annot to holup the confirmation, but I woullike your thoughts on that.	N
But let me tell you, every time you come before this Committee, I am going to voice concern about the Aeronautics Industry.	N
I think everyone in this Committee, whether they are from Alaska or from Virginia or from Texas or from anywhere else, are concerneabout the aeronautics funding because air travel affects us all.	N
One of the great strengths in the 20th century, of America anits leadership, was in aeronautics.	N
For the first time ever, going from 90 percent of the commercial aviation market in the 1940s, we for the first time have come in seconlast year, down to 45 percent of global sales.	N
This current administration anthis proposebudget proposes another cut in half, which is forcing some of our research centers to lay off capable, uniquely skilleindividuals, who are not readily founin the market.	N
Moreover, there is a concern about young people in engineering, particularly aeronautical engineering.	N
This certainly does not sena positive message, if we care to be a leader in aeronautics, which I think is important for our security anfor prosperity in this country.	N
When one looks at all the developments anthe improvements in aviation over the years, many of those, whether it is civilian or for military aircraft, came from the R&D, the high-	N
risk research that was done at our research centers, NASA research centers, arounthe country.	N
Now I understanthat you have yet to be confirmeas Administrator, but I woullike for you to explain to me anto our Committee the rationale behinthe dramatic cuts in the new vehicle systems program, which is conducting research on the feasibility of hypersonic flight.	N
Coulyou share with me anour Committee the rationale for these further drastic cuts in aeronautics and, moreover, why the cuts in the new vehicle systems?	N
Well, in the event that we are going to address the concerteplan, which they are effectuating in Europe to dominate by the year 2020, anthey are investing a great deal, billions of dollars, in research andevelopment, anproducing quality aircraft, do you see cutting research andevelopment for new vehicle systems in aeronautics as a way of addressing that competitive challenge that we are facing, which is important, again, for our military, for civilian aircraft anit actually is also goofor our balance of trade.	N
So do you see cutting research andevelopment by half again, so it is about one-quarter of what it was 10 years ago, do you see that as a logical, rational way of handling this or addressing it?	N
Understand, in our private conversation we discussethis as well, how important I feel this is for the future of our country.	N
I feel that we ought to be concernethat, for example, the most advancefighter must be testeoverseas in wintunnels in Europe, because our own country has faileto invest in our own wintunnels.	N
Anso it is my view that--I know there are a lot of priorities anwe do neeto be in the leain space, but we also neeto be paying attention to the very practical, beneficial aspects of research andevelopment here in this country, working with the private sector, working with defense, in aeronautics.	N
AnI just cannot countenance seeing the atrophying of a very capable skillework force plus the encouragement for the future with these, I think, penny-wise-	N
AnI hope to work with my colleagues to improve the aeronautics funding, particularly for the new vehicle system, which is important for the future.	N
Senator, I will be happy to discuss with you sometime the availability of money for that research anthe redundancy of the current research.	N
Anto Mr. Boardman, as you may know or may not know, we in Hawaii have one narrow-gauge railroad.	N
Mr. Chairman, I have been calleto responto an amendment by Senator Cochran, but I diwant to say that I have known Nancy Norfor longer than I even want to say, at least 30 years.	N
Ms. Nancy Norhas been nominateto be Commissioner of Consumer Products Safety Commission.	N
The Honorable William Cobey is nominateto be a member of the boarof directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.	N
Let me ask you if you have family with you today that you wish to introduce for the record, either of you?	N
Anmy opening statement, which I placein the record, I identifieyour backgrounds, each of you.	N
Currently the agency has a cap on the fines, $7,000 per product with a ceiling of 1.65 million.	N
We have been receiving letters ane-mail from other interesteparties citing, for example, that on June 2003 Endovascular Technologies was fineover $92 million in civil ancriminal penalties by FDA.	N
Anlarge corporations can factor certain civil penalties into their cost of doing business.	N
It is my pleasure to present to the Committee Dr. William Jeffrey, of Herndon, Virginia, who's been nominateby the President to be the Director of the National Institute of Standards anTechnology.	N
Technology-baseinnovation, as you know, Mr. Chairman, remains one of the nation's most important competitive challenges.	N
Today, more than at any other time in our history, technological innovation anprogress depenon the tools that NIST helps develop to measure, evaluate, anstandardize the technologies that emerge.	N
As a result of NIST's work on these tools, we're putting our companies, here in the UniteStates, at the forefront of innovation.	N
When I say the President has made a wise choice, if you look at Dr. Jeffrey's technical leadership skills, his experience both in government anthe private sector, make him, truly, an outstanding choice to serve as Director of NIST.	D
Now, we know, as goopoliticians, when we want to buila crowd, we neeto call Mr. Hernandez, because he has brought a crowhere today.	N
I'm very pleaseto be able to introduce my fellow Texan, Israel Hernandez, who has been nominatefor the positions of--	N
to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce anDirector General of the U.S. Foreign anCommercial Service.	N
His harwork andedication earnehim the position of Deputy Assistant to the President, after the President was elected.	D
Mr. Hernandez assistein strategic planning anintergovernmental affairs at the White House during the President's first term.	N
Currently, he is the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Commerce anthe Acting Under Secretary for International Trade.	D
He has workeso harhis whole life, anthis is the area in which he will excel for sure.	D
He graduatefrom the University of Texas, anhe was in the first class to graduate from the George Bush--George H.W. Bush School of Government anPublic Affairs at Texas A&M University.	D
do think that he's going to do a great job, anI highly recommenhim to our Commerce Committee anfor confirmation in the Senate.	D
Well, Mr. Hernandez, you've been nominateto join one of the outstanding leaders, I think, of our country, in Mr. Gutierrez.	D
Anin your written statement you mention a strategic vision for foreign ancommercial service.	N
And, after the in-depth conversation I hawith him, I'm convincehe will make a superb Assistant Secretary.	N
As you've indicated, Mr. Hawley's experience with the Transportation post, I think this experience woulbe most helpful in this new position.	D
Do you believe that TSA is the central place where direction anpolicymaking decisions be made involving all modes of transportation?	N
AnI think everybody woulagree--I hope they would--that the Senate Commerce Committee has really lethe way in pushing for increasefederal efforts to help secure our nation's passenger anfreight railroads.	D
As a former railroaemployee with Union Pacific, do you believe that the TSA is doing enough to help railroads meet security needs?	N
you know enough to comment on Amtrak anwhat needs to be done to make Amtrak more secure?	N
Supposedly, there have been some studies, anthe sense is that inline baggage screening systems woulsave money by increasing efficiency aneffectiveness.	N
Now, one last line of questioning, if you will, anthat is, after 9/11, you--as I understanit, you helpecoordinate the federalizeairport screening mission at TSA?	N
What role diyou play in the contracting for services to develop the screener work-force?	N
So, does that mean that, for example, you would--you were not involvein setting the staffing level for the number of screeners?	N
As you've noted, you'll be the first Administrator of RITA, so you woulhave a wide latitude in shaping the goals anpolicy of this new agency within DOT.	N
I was sitting here thinking of a frienof mine, now deceased, who was spending his time trying to figure out how to use helium-filleballoons to lift containers off the grounanpropel them, with some sort of an engine, so that they woulmove throughout the country without being on the roads.	N
Sensing all the nominees are eager to get to work, I ask that my statement be made part of the record.	N
The Members of this Committee, of course, know well the very significant work of the National Transportation Safety Board.	N
They provide independent federal oversight for all civil aviation accidents in the U.S., as well as investigatory responsibility for significant tragedies on our waterways, railroads, anhighways.	N
She then was on the White House Domestic Policy Council during the Carter Administration as Assistant Director for Employment Policy.	D
She then went to work on Capitol Hill, including 4 years as the minority staff director on the Labor anHuman Resources Committee, anthen went over to the House side anserveas Chief of Staff for 7 years for Congressman Sandy Levin who, Mr. Chairman, is here with us this morning.	D
She joinethe Clinton Administration in 1993 as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Labor.	D
She left the Labor Department in 1995, became Assistant to the President anSecretary to the Cabinet.	D
As Cabinet Secretary, she was the key administrative official in the coordination of the response to a number of important natural annational disasters, including the ValuJet anthe TWA flight 800 crashes.	D
So she has dealt extensively in that position with the National Transportation Safety Boaranthe Federal Aviation Administration anknows intimately their work.	D
In March 1997, she was nominateto be Deputy Secretary of Labor, unanimously confirmeby the Senate in that post.	D
So she was at the Labor Department as the Chief Operating Officer of the Department beginning in 1997.	D
She has also serveas Vice Chair of the Presidential Council on the U.S. Coast GuarRoles anMissions, anwhen she left the Federal Government, she was at the National Trust for Historic Preservation for 5 years.	D
She is an enormously accomplished, skilled, knowledgeable, aneffective government servant.	D
She has carrieout very significant responsibilities in her various positions over the course of her career.	D
AnI have every confidence she will do an absolutely outstanding job as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, anI commenher very strongly to the Committee.	D
I have two letters, one from Senator Barbara Mikulski, the other from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, supporting Kathryn O'Leary Higgins for this position.	N
I also want to say to Ms. Dale, living a lot of places arounthe country, thank you also for choosing Virginia as your place of residence as well.	D
He has impressive qualifications, anI know you have it as part of the recorfor this nomination.	D
Since his confirmation more than 2\1/2\ ana half years ago, Mark Rosenker has demonstratehimself to be a qualifieanenergizemember of this important federal agency.	D
I suspect during your comments, the Chairman will ask you to introduce your bride anany other colleagues or friends who are here who have come to support your nomination.	N
During his tenure, Mr. Chairman, Mark has brought a wealth of management anadvocacy experience to the board.	D
With more than 36 years of active anreserve duty in the Air Force, having risen to the rank of major general, Mark's decorations include the DistinguisheService Medal, Legion of Merit antwo Meritorious Service Medals, which is outstanding for somebody to be serving on the National Transportation Safety Board.	N
I think because of his unique combination of private sector anmilitary experience, President Bush appointeMark to be Deputy Assistant to the President anDirector of the White House Military Office.	D
After serving for 2 years in that White House position, President Bush nominateMark to serve in his current position at the NTSB.	D
Since he was confirmein March of 2003, President Bush has twice designateMark to serve in the role of Vice Chairman, ansince March of this year, Mark has been serving with distinction as Acting Chairman of the NTSB.	D
During this time on the board, Mark has been a strong anoutspoken advocate for transportation safety.	D
For his leadership role anin a variety of ways, but particularly in recreational boating issues, the National Safe Boating Council presentetheir highest honor, the Confluence Award, to him.	D
This is traditionally given to Members of Congress, anMark Rosenker is one of the very few executive branch people to receive this award.	D
The aviation industry also acknowledges his leadership role in the challenging issue of preventing runway incursions.	D
He has been outspoken in attempting to get the FAA to require that all children under the age of 2 be securein safety belts while flying.	N
I think all the passengers woullike that, anso long as they are loose enough that the kids can lay over, if they are asleep anquiet, that probably woulbe fine as well as a parent.	N
He was presentewith their 2001 DistinguisheCentennial Graduate Award, which is quite an honor.	D
Clearly, Mark Rosenker, Mr. Chairman anMembers of the Committee, has demonstratethat he is capable anenthusiastic about the Boaranits mission, anI respectfully urge my colleagues to swiftly support his reconfirmation.	D
We have a letter of support here for Ms. Shana Dale from Representative Ralph Hall, anI haseveral personal phone calls from the administrator saying why hayou not been the subject of hearings.	N
Senator I woulsay in my experience with the Boaranlooking at some of the current issues, I think there are a number of things that are of concern.	N
I think the IG report that has already been mentioneraises some very troubling issues, anI know that is of concern to the Committee.	N
I know it is a focus of the Vice Chairman anwill be, obviously, an important concern to those of us who hope to serve on the Board.	N
There are some other areas that are of interest, for example, the nexus between safety ansecurity.	N
It proveto be an accident, but obviously security has come to the forefront in the last few years, anI am interestein making sure that the focus on safety for all modes of transportation is not being jeopardizeby the increasefocus on national security.	N
I think there is a concern that we all share about the number of recent accidents in foreign countries on foreign carriers.	N
Our safety recorin aviation here has been pretty goothe last couple of years, but there are an increasing number of fatal accidents occurring abroad.	N
It made a number of very important recommendations, particularly in the aviation area, about the work of the Board, the needs of the staff.	N
I woulhope, if confirmed, to go back to that report anbegin to ask some questions about which of those recommendations shoulget more attention.	N
We neeto make sure that there is the training another kinds of things that the staff there neeto get the job done.	N
However, as you are well aware, last week GAO issuea report citing that they submitte45 recommendations to NASA in 2003, anof that number, 3 have been implementeanI believe 13 partially implemented.	N
What are your thoughts on the fact that airline accidents are now being diminisheas compareto other accidents, rail anhighways ansuch?	N
I realize that with 43,000 highway fatalities, you do not have the time to investigate even 1 percent of them.	N
But we note that too large a proportion of those involve teenagers anit also involves exceeding speeds.	N
Mr. Rosenker, every life is valuable whether it is 1 or 1,000, anwhen you compare the fatality rate on the highways with Iraq, Iraq seems to be a very safe place.	N
Ms. Higgins, in this war on terrorism, we require by law anwe mandate that certain things occur, anyet the potential for death andestruction on our highways is much greater than what terrorism has wreckeupon us.	N
Do you think that we shoulgo beyonrecommendations anjust say this is the way it is going to be done?	N
I know that oftentimes NASA's headlines or news coverage tento be dominateby the human space flight program, anwe understanthat.	N
But NASA does many other things, anone of the things you have haat NASA, at the agency, is you have haan initiative on nanotechnology, which I think is really potentially very, very significant.	N
I know research institutions in my state are very focuseon nanotechnology, as they are arounthe country, anit really has a very promising future I believe.	N
How do you finthe appropriate balance between human space flight anthe other very important scientific missions that NASA has? 	N
I know that in September NASA releaseits exploration architecture study which includes a plan to return to the moon with Apollo-style capsules, I believe arounthe year 2018.	N
As I understanthe plan, NASA is going to try to finsavings within existing programs in order to shift resources to this return to the moon.	N
But as I understanit, maybe one of the areas of savings might be with the Shuttle program, but news reports have indicatethat over the next 5 years, the Shuttle will actually neemore money, not less, to operate.	N
Now, Mr. Rosenker anMs. Higgins, in Arkansas we haa train accident on October 15 in Texarkana, Arkansas, which straddles the line between Arkansas anTexas.	N
Apparently it collidewith another Union Pacific train that was stationary on the tracks.	N
It killeone Arkansan, hospitalize20 other people, destroyetwo homes ana rail bridge, an700 people hato be evacuatefrom their homes temporarily due to the release of some gas or at least a fearerelease of some gas.	N
I understanabout the complexity, but on something like this where a train just hits another train in the station, do you think it will be 10 months or longer, or do you have some sense of that?	N
Well, like you said, I want you to be very thorough, but I just appreciate your keeping me informeas that continues.	N
In fact, if everything goes well, we will have a markup on your nomination tomorrow, which is quite extraordinary.	N
Otherwise, you can be assurethat it will be done within a week so you will be harat work within a week.	N
Both you have great experiences in antitrust work, but as you know your responsibilities will be much broader than that.	D
Well if I may followup, I'm certain that you are well aware that GAO issuethe report in May of 2004 suggesting that the FTC mergers of these oil companies resultein high prices.	N
Knowing that, woulyou favor the Congress as suggested, or alludeto by the Chair consider amending the laws so that you woulhave authority to enforce--take enforcement action.	N
Not just investigate in the case of price gouging, because you dihave price gouging, $6 a gallon for no reason whatsoever.	N
Is there any other agency with the authority to enforce price gouging, anti-price gouging laws, short of collusion?	N
We're now in the process of considering amendments to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, anwe finfor example that words are now in our vocabulary that never appearein those days such as spyware.	N
Gentlemen, we hear too much I think about the global economy on the news media another places.	N
But as a matter of fact the Commission's practices have been to look at our own economy in determining what is fair competition, what is necessary in terms of acquisitions, mergers.	N
To what extent shoulthe policies of the FTC change because of the advent of the participants in the global economy?	N
We have global giants now, the German post office, really indirectly owns one of the air carriers in the UniteStates now.	N
We have so many different entities coming in from China that are really--they're purchasing part of our infrastructure, but they're competing literally through one of our own corporate shells with our existing economy.	N
Have you lookeat this in terms of whether the Chairman shoulbroaden our scope as far as determining what is competition anwho we're competing with as far as the FTC is concerned?	N
Is it strictly interstate commerce that we shoulbe dealing with, or are we going to be in your terms looking at global commerce?	N
I just want to emphasize the point that you brought up that it is a problem for us, not just on the Commerce Committee, but also on the Defense Committee anright now we're coping with a major decision, shoulwe open up purchases to the worlwhen we know that the manufacturers in certain countries are being subsidizeby their governments annot paying taxes that our manufacturers woulhave to pay, but they happen to be our allies.	N
I think you're exceptionally qualified, each one of you anwe congratulate you anas a matter of fact envy you, as lawyers with an opportunity to serve at the FTC during this critical perioof our history.	D
Today's hearing will be short, so I will forego a lengthy statement so that the nominees can answer any questions that may neeto be addresseto them by the Committee Members.	N
Although, Senator Rockefeller, if you woullike to speak at great length, certainly you woulbe recognizeto do so.	N
On April 4, 2005, the President nominateDr. DaviSampson to be Deputy Secretary of Commerce.	N
But thank you, Mrs. Sampson, for sacrificing to allow your husbanto serve his country in this way.	N
Today's witnesses may have learnea little bit about the importance of fish to Members of this Committee.	N
I dihave a large chart with a smiling fish so you woulthink National Marine Fisheries Service every morning, Dr. Sampson.	N
Analso, Mr. Sullivan, you currently serve as Deputy General Counsel of the Defense Department.	D
This is a credit to you to be recognized, to be nominatefor these very important positions.	N
Mr. Sullivan, both you anDr. Sampson, you are going to have very critical positions at the Department of Commerce.	D
I dinot have a chance to talk to Mr. Sullivan, but I haa wonderful conversation with Dr. Sampson.	N
Anwe discussethe importance of manufacturing, the importance of jobs, the importance of what do you do when people 48 years old, you know--annobody has really gooanswers.	N
International trade, we discussed, anthe importance of having fair trade, as well as free trade.	N
Sometimes it is easy to say both, but harto differentiate when it comes to the practice of it.	N
I expresseto you the importance of just you, as an individual, to this country anto my state.	N
We are honoreto have with us this morning to speak on behalf of Dr. Sampson, I believe, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is a very valueMember of this Committee.	N
Senator Hutchison, we woulbe glato open with your statement and, after that, have you join us, if you can, at the podium.	N
He is an assistant secretary now anhas done a terrific job as the principal advisor on policy development to the Secretary.	N
Anin his role as directing operations of the Economic Development Administration, he initiatea reorganization of that part of the Commerce Department for the first time in the 37 years of the Department of Commerce history.	N
Also, in addition to his professional background, he has a wonderful track recorof vision ancharacter ancommitment to whatever job he holds.	N
Before he assumehis present job at the Department of Commerce, he was involvein economic development activities at the state level in Texas.	D
He was appointeby then Governor Bush to serve as Vice Chairman of the Texas Strategic Economic Development Planning Commission anthen later chairethe Texas Council on Workforce anEconomic Competitiveness.	D
So I think he has hadeep experience in exactly what we want the Commerce Department to do.	D
Anthat is finways to create a better economic climate in our country ancreate more jobs ankeep our industry in America anmake sure that we have a healthy business climate in our country.	N
I am really pleaseto learn of his experience in economic development anhis knowledge of a variety of issues at the Commerce Department.	D
When you look at the Commerce Department, it has a huge jurisdictional responsibility, all the way from trade to fisheries another economic development.	N
Let us go aheawith John Sullivan anhis testimony on behalf of his nomination to be General Counsel of the Department of Commerce.	N
You certainly have plenty of legal experience angooexperience working as the Deputy General Counsel at the Department of Defense.	D
I also notethat you serveas a law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals----	D
Whether you agree with his decisions or not, he certainly has a well-earnereputation for having some of the brightest ansubsequently most successful law clerks of just about any appellate court judge in this country.	D
Anin a moment I woulrecognize him for a statement or any questions he woullike to make.	N
This is parochial perhaps in nature, but it certainly involves a broapart of the country.	N
I grew up on the banks of the Pascagoula River rowing in a small skiff six miles off the coast to the nearest island, RounIsland.	N
I grew up next door to shrimpers anoystermen anresnapper fishermen anhardworking, great men anwomen, who worketough hours but are really great people, too.	N
Anso for 36 years in my public career as a staff member, as a Congressman ana Senator, I have been working to try to be sensitive to particularly the Gulf of Mexico fisheries in general, at all levels, conservation, sports, ancommercial.	N
AnI must confess my bent towarcommercial because I do think that they are farming the seas anare an important part of our economy.	N
They provide a lot of income to the economy ana gooliving for the people that participate.	N
They are quite often influenceor affecteby the weather and, you know, overfishing, which they have to control.	N
But for years, I have been battling for fisheries in the Gulf, quite often a pretty lonely battle anonly with marginal success.	N
Between 2003 an2005, the portion of the NMFS going to the Gulf of Mexico variebetween 7 to 9 percent, only 7 to 9 percent, while the portion of the Nation's fish caught in the Gulf of Mexico average17 percent by weight, 21 percent by value.	N
Meanwhile, the percentage of NMFS budget being helat headquarters has risen from 20 to 24 percent.	N
We are supposeto be pushing more money out of this city of what is available into where the rubber meets the roaor the hook hits the water.	N
Secretary Evans, when he left, he sent me a nice letter with a fish at the bottom, drawn on the bottom of this letter.	N
I askehim to provide me with apportionment by region of the Administration's 2006 request for NMFS, the justification for it, how they are going to adjust this inadequacy.	N
Now at the very minimum, you talk about respect, Mr. Sullivan, for the Congress anthe Committee.	N
It seems to me that while you may not be able to comply with our request for the region, you coulat least provide the information on what the situation is anwhat the situation is going to be.	N
Now Senator Hutchison from Texas anSenator Bill Nelson from Florida anSenator Rockefeller from the north side of the Gulf woulall appreciate your cooperation.	N
During the Clinton Administration, it was the Department of Commerce that was meant to decide what was going to happen about steel policy.	N
Now when I bring up the worsteel policy, Chairman Lott tends to die, because he says, ``Here we go again.''	N
Anthere was a very interesting dynamic which causea fairly substantial rift, actually, between myself anPresident Clinton for a number of years.	N
Anthat is that the Department of Commerce sort of discusses what shoulbe our policy with WTO, what shoulbe our policy with the trade representatives, that, too, but what shoulbe our policy about making sure that we keep manufacturing, that the steel industry remain healthy.	N
We understanthat Brazil anChina anothers are--the Department of Commerce's policy was pretty good.	N
The problem was that when we woulhave meetings of the steel caucus, it was Secretary Ruben who became the Department of Commerce.	N
Anin fact, he, I think, influencethe President to back away from his commitment to West Virginia to try anhelp our steel industry.	N
Anthe result was our steel industries have been through bankruptcies anall kinds of situations.	N
AnI care about that because now, as Governor, I literally--with Weirton Steel, which I think is the eighth largest producer, they were about to close down because of labor-management strife.	N
AnI went up with some people anspent a number of weeks anactually turneit around, saveit.	N
But what was interesting is the fact that there is the State Department, there is Treasury, there is monetary policy, there are all kinds of other things.	N
The Department of Commerce economic decisions, manufacturing decisions, never stanon their own, because in a sense they cannot, because they are just part of the picture.	N
So once you say something is part of the larger picture, then that tends to marginalize what you might be trying to think of in the Department of Treasury or the Treasury of the UniteStates woulsay: Well, no we cannot do that because we have this anthat political problem, or somebody else woulsay: Well, we have special problems with China or Brazil, other things that we have to tento.	N
AnI am interestein your sort of reaction on the part of each of you to that very real situation.	N
I do not mimic the situation, but it was one that turneout to be very destructive to us.	N
Which, before I call on Mr. Sullivan, leads me to the seconpart of that, which is that you are quite right that the President got very high marks in West Virginia for doing the Section 201.	N
But what happenethereafter, almost nobody in West Virginia really understood, or across the country understands where steel is produced.	N
Anthat is that Bob Zoellick, then USTR, took 95 percent of what the Section 201 covereanexempteit from Section 201.	N
Anit is that pull between agencies anpull between larger ansmaller priorities, which is interesting to me.	N
AnI understanhe is a tremendously credentialeperson for this high-level executive responsibility of Number 2 in the Department.	D
Anwhat the legislation does, it says that if there is a competitive alternative to a government website, that the government cannot compete with the competitive alternative.	N
At the direction of President Bush upon his inauguration, he directethat all the agencies of government woulcome out with a website so that information woulbe freely anquickly available to the people of the UniteStates.	N
This particular website for the National Weather Service was especially helpful ancritical when four hurricanes hit my state within a 6-week periostarting last hurricane season, as a matter of fact.	N
Now I do not know what the weather is like in Pennsylvania, but I know getting information about hurricanes can be a matter of life andeath to people in Florida, as was the case.	N
As a matter of fact, there were recordenine billion, with a b, hits on the National Weather Service website during that 6-week perioof those hurricanes.	N
The most up until that point habeen the six million hits on the NASA website when the Rover landeon the surface of Mars.	N
Now what Senator Santorum's bill S. 786 wouldo woulrequire the elimination of the website because there is a company in his state, AccuWeather, that offers the same information.	N
AnI hope I do not have to come see you in the future to reminyou of your statement today.	N
AnMr. Chairman, I wouljust say in passing that I want to commento you the service that NOAA does anthe hurricane trackers.	N
I have flown on those hurricane hunters, in fact was flying on the one when the first hurricane, Charlie, was south of Cuba, as they are dropping the sondes in predesignatepoints along the route, measuring all kinds of data.	N
It comes back to the airplane real time, is formulateansent by satellite to the National Hurricane Center, which then computes the data which gives us so much of a better accuracy in predicting the path anthe ferociousness of a hurricane.	N
So having been there anseen what the valuable service is, I woulcommenthat to you as you get into the deliberations on those hurricane hunters.	N
Senator Nelson, you do know where the Air Force's hurricane hunters originate from, do you not?	N
AnI woullike to welcome all of you, the nominees, anthank you for your commitment to service for our country.	N
He hano connection whatsoever with Utah, which was a little unusual in the people that we interviewed, because we trieto get people who hasome tie to Utah.	D
But he haa backgrounthat fit the responsibilities that I was assuming as a member of the Banking Committee.	D
Anso, we workehim pretty hard, anlate hours, but somehow he manageto slip in a courtship into his activity, annow he's here with a wife antwo children.	N
While we were on the Banking Committee, after the Republicans took control and--I was made chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Services anTechnology, anwe began to hola hearing--series of hearings on technology.	N
I saito him, ``I hear something about the millennium challenge, the change of computers when we go from 1999 to 2000.	N
Senator Dodd, as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, was there, and, at the enof the subcommittee hearing, he saito me, ``Mr. Chairman, we neeanother hearing.	N
Anout of the series of hearings that we helin the Banking Committee, which Robert managed, came the creation of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, with myself as chairman anSenator Doas the vice chairman.	N
Anwe startelooking arounfor a high-powerestaff director to run that committee, anit pretty soon became pretty clear we already haone.	N
Robert Cresanti was there anavailable, anhe became the staff director of that committee.	N
If everything goes well, they'll say there was no problem anwe wasteeverybody's money; anif it doesn't go well, they'll say it was all our fault.''	N
But the series of hearings that were set up for the Year-2000 technology problem were, I think, the Senate at its very best.	N
Anwe haa series of hearings that I think contributesignificantly to the fact that the country dicome through the 2000 computer time change without any difficulties.	N
He then did, as many of our staffers do when they've establishea reputation for themselves, he was in great demandowntown, anhe left Congressional service to go with trade associations downtown.	D
But he hamade the transition, if you will, from a young, inexperienced, but anxious, staff aide focusing on financial problems to a very experienced, carefully traineexpert on technology.	D
Anwhen he tolme that he habeen approacheto become an Under Secretary for Commerce, focusing on technology, I said, ``I'm glafor the American people that you'be willing to do this, but are you willing to take the pay cut?''	D
So, I can recommenhim from more than a dozen years of very direct personal experience, anassure the Committee that he comes very well prepared, very well trained, and, just as important, if not more so, anxious to return to public service anmake available to the American people the skills that he has accumulateover the past dozen years.	D
I am pleaseto be before the Committee this afternoon to introduce a fellow Alaskan ana friend, Vice Admiral Thomas Barrett, the President's nominee to serve as the Administrator for Pipeline anHazardous Materials Safety Administration at the Department of Transportation.	N
I've hathe privilege of knowing the admiral anhis wife since my service in the Alaska State Legislature.	N
anI shouldn't say ``rare,'' because I think we have an opportunity up north, as you know, Mr. Chairman, to get some of our--of the military's finest serving us up north, but when the admiral was in Juneau serving the Coast Guarin that region, I think it is fair to say that we knew we were serveby one of the finest--annot just from the perspective of the Coast Guard, but an individual who became involvein the community.	N
We haan opportunity for the social events anhaving a Sunday morning brunch talking about education concerns in the State of Alaska.	N
This gentleman is one who not only has his focus on the job before him, but in providing a true quality of life for people, wherever his assignment.	N
He deployeto Vietnam, earnea law degree from George Washington University, a graduate of the Army War College.	D
He was in the--he was chief counsel anproject staff for the Outer Continental Shelf Safety Staff, Office of Marine Safety anEnvironmental Protection.	D
He haseveral tours in Alaska before moving up to the post of commanding officer of the Coast GuarSupport Center, home to nine commands on Kodiak Island, the--which, as you know, is the largest operational Coast Guarbase in the world.	D
When we look at the position that Admiral Barrett has been nominatefor, when it comes to the area of safety, when it comes to the area of leadership, I don't think that the President coulhave selectea finer individual.	D
I'm pleaseto recommenhim to the Committee, anknow that he will continue to serve this country well.	N
It's gooto see so many people who are residents of Virginia here, Mr. Cresanti anMr. Barrett, but I'm going to specifically introduce three nominees, who are residents of Virginia, to the Committee.	N
The three fellow Virginians are all being nominatefor posts within the Department of Transportation: Nicole Nason, Tyler Duvall, anDaviSanborn.	N
As a young girl, she watcheas her father ran the traffic division in Suffolk County, New York.	D
She was taught, early anoften, the value of safety through the strong example set by her father.	N
I know she'll carry these values with her as she prepares to assume a new position within the Department of Transportation in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.	D
During her time with the Department of Transportation, she has worketirelessly to promote a close working relationship between the Administration anCongress.	D
I think that will be invaluable for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as they're slateto work with this committee, Mr. Chairman, on a number of important issues, like reform of vehicle fuel efficiency standards ancombating impairedriving.	N
But I know that Tyler, in his own right, is a product of outstanding Virginia schools, Washington anLee University anthe University of Virginia School of Law.	N
Tyler has extensive experience advising the Secretary of Transportation on a broarange of transportation policy anlegal issues relateto surface anmaritime transportation.	D
I am confident, Mr. Chairman anSenator Inouye, that Tyler will be a top-quality Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy.	D
Finally, I woullike to introduce another fine Virginian, DaviSanborn of Smithfield, Virginia, who the President nominateto serve as Administrator of the Maritime Administration.	N
Davihas impressive credentials ana wealth of experience, both domestically aninternationally, but, most importantly, has a sincere desire anvision to promote our Nation's ports anshipping industry.	D
If you look through his record--most recently, director of ship operations for Dubai Ports International, or DP World, he was responsible for port infrastructure, expansion, anefficiency while developing new lines of business.	D
He has workefor CMA-CGM America, which is a company baseout of Norfolk, Virginia, where he controllecargo logistics andemonstratehis ability to seamlessly coordinate shipping with rail antruck operations.	D
This is a multimillion-dollar budget that he has to oversee there, staff of hundreds, redesigning organizations.	N
I look forwarto this committee working with him anall three of these nominees for swift confirmation so they can get to work with full portfolio for the American people.	N
Well, then we will proceewith Mr. Cresanti, the nominee to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.	N
I ask that question because just a week ago, the President, as you noted, made a statement citing the importance of competitiveness in technology, anwe must have investment.	N
I think nanotechnology coulpotentially be a huge development in history anin America's economy, anwe coulput ourselves in a position of really becoming the dominant player in the worlin nanotechnology.	N
It may be--it may develop into something that may be a little bit more like the--say, the genetically modifieorganisms, where, in many parts of the world, in many markets, that's very controversial, anthere's very low consumer confidence in those things, et cetera.	N
So--ana lot of suspicion about those things--but in the nanotechnology world, one thing I've noticeis that, really, it is a worlthat is being developeright now by small businesses.	N
AnI guess I'just ask you, do you have any plans to bolster the public trust in nanotechnology analso help these small businesses develop these amazing technologies antry to implement those anget those into the marketplace?	N
As soon as possible, we'll have a markup, anwe hope to soon be able to call you ``Under Secretary.''	N
If I might interject, Mr. Chairman, our Governor signethat legislation, I believe, in the last day or two, so--I mean, just very recently.	N
But I woullike to submit, if I may, a few questions for your consideration, somewhat technical.	N
But I just want to tell Mr. Sanborn, when I arrivein the Washington, in the U.S. Senate, if my recollection is correct, American bottoms carrie85 percent of all the cargo containers in the seven seas.	N
That's an area I spent a gooportion of my career, particularly since I've been in the Senate, working on aviation issues, surface transportation, safety.	N
My own State hanot passea primary seatbelt law, because, as I saion the floor of the Senate, if you tell us what we must do or we'll be punished, we will not do it; but if you tell us that we'll get a rewarif we act responsibly, we probably will do it.	N
But also, of course, workeon the--as I said, the highway bill anaviation, for Amtrak, freight.	N
We're a very mobile society, anwe want modern means of technology, modern means of transportation.	N
You neeto be advocates not just for the position that you're in anto us, you neeto be advocates within the Administration, too.	N
I think, overall, it's a pretty goobudget, but I think transportation, you know, is barely holding its own; and, only that, because of highway bill, I guess, marginally up a little bit, anyet we're finding other places to spenmoney that don't mean nearly as much, in terms of the economy anjobs, creation of jobs.	N
The three of us, even the gentleman from--the Senator from Arkansas, are particularly interestein maritime.	N
AnI woulpredict, right now, the day will come where we're going to regret our neglect over the last 50 years in our--of our maritime industry, across the board.	N
And, with your background, you've got the potential, I think, to be--become a spokesman ana thinker.	D
In Washington, all we've done lately is to complain about the past antry to blame somebody.	N
What are we going to do in the future to make sure that the crisis looming before us in maritime does not occur?	N
Anif you have to winup in the Oval Office convincing the President, we will escort you.	N
Addeto Government Affairs, like Mr.--like our chairman, you know, I hope you will--you know, you work a two-way street, andon't just occasionally give us a call to--	N
And, of course, we know him, anwe've workewith him, we've servewith him, we like him.	N
But, you know, sometimes our message needs to get through to him, and, more importantly, from him to the White House.	N
I've learnethat quite often these Government Affairs people anpositions don't work for their Department.	N
So, if you're going to be in that position, if that is, in fact, a place you'll have an impact, I hope you'll be aggressive for the transportation point of view.	N
I do take a particular interest in who goes into these positions, anI'm counting on really good, strong leadership from all of you.	D
Shoulwe strengthen our requirements for things like rollover, ejection mitigation, roof crush, impact projection?	N
Anthe other--a week ago, tonight, President Bush said--I believe the phrase he useis, ``America is addicteto oil,'' or petroleum.	N
I know that there have been some innovations with engine design to make them more energy efficient, et cetera, which is great.	N
And, Mr. Duvall, let me ask you, if I can turn my attention to you, I was reviewing the President's FY07 budget, the one that Senator Lott likes so much----	N
Their largest industry has pretty much saithat one of the reasons they are there is because they can fly their salespeople out, anthey can fly customers in.	N
Anthey've pretty much said, if they lose that essential air service status, they may move.	N
Anso, essential air service is not just a convenience for casual flyers, it's very important to business, very important to our economy.	N
I'like to get your thoughts on the fact that this budget cuts funding for essential air service about in half.	N
One last question on that is--or on a slightly different subject--is, there's a--there have been two significant rulemakings that deal with truck driver hours of service--I don't know if you've followethat at all--andriver training requirements that have been, actually, thrown out of Federal court.	N
And, as I understanit, I think it's a fair statement to say that one of the reasons they are--they have been thrown out of court, I shoulsay--is because the agency dinot follow Congressional intent.	N
Well, Mr. Duvall, it so happens that essential air service startein Alaska at the time we brought about deregulation of the CAB, Civil Aeronautics Board.	N
Last week, I hearthere's one village that has been canceleout of essential air service, which means it's absolutely strandeup there on the tundra.	N
Now, I hope you mean what you said, that you're going to look at it anput some priority behinthe rural aspects of essential air service.	D
I'm sure it has acceptance elsewhere in the country, but, very clearly, a State like mine, where air transportation is the only means of transportation, it ought not to be abandoned.	N
Let me state--it's obvious to all of you--you're going to serve with a gentleman that we all consider to be, you know, sort of a gift of Goto the Government, that's Secretary Mineta.	D
We've workewith him in the Congress, we've workewith him in the Department another jobs.	D
He's a native of Tucson, Arizona, who, as you know, has been nominateto be Commandant of the Coast Guard.	D
I note that this is somewhat ironic, since the largest body of water in the Admiral's hometown is the University of Arizona's swimming pool.	N
Mr. Chairman, Admiral Allen has dedicatehimself to public service, having servein the U.S. Coast Guarsince his graduation from the Coast GuarAcademy.	D
Presently, as you know, he's serving as Chief of Staff to the Commandant, anall of us, all Americans, I think, are familiar with his recent work as the principal Federal official overseeing the government's recovery efforts in response to Hurricane Katrina.	D
His leadership style ancommitment to the people affecteby the disaster have been roundly applauded.	D
He lethe Atlantic Forces in the Coast Guard's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th.	D
I believe these experiences will guide Admiral Allen as he leads the Coast Guarin securing our ports anprotecting our waterways.	D
And, finally, Mr. Chairman, in addition to an undergraduate degree from the Coast GuarAcademy, an institution some might say he foolishly chose over an appointment to the Naval Academy, Admiral Allen holds a Master of Public Administration degree from The George Washington University, ana Master of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.	D
I intento aggregate the policy guidance that's been containein the HomelanSecurity Act, the Maritime Transportation Security Act, anthe recent National Strategy for Maritime Security into a Coast GuarMaritime Strategy that will serve as a blueprint for legislative, regulatory, anbudgetary recommendations.	N
The nature of the maritime domain requires an integrated, layereapproach to security, anthe Coast Guarstrategy will support that approach.	N
Anour day-to-day mission execution will be guideby the principles of operation that have evolveover two centuries of Coast Guaroperations.	N
The exercise of these principles by our ship captains, pilots, air crews, anboat crews was never more evident than in our response to Hurricane Katrina.	N
AnI, also, relieon these principles in the execution of my duties as the principal Federal official.	N
We are nothing without our people, anour people cannot be effective without the right tools.	N
On the capabilities side, the Coast Guarhas embarkeon a comprehensive recapitalization of our cutters, aircraft, sensor architecture through the IntegrateDeepwater System.	N
Delivery of these assets to relieve aging ships, aircraft, ansystems is essential to our force's near-term readiness anlong-term effectiveness.	N
Extensive effort has been expendeto adjust this program to meet new post-9/11 requirements anaddress gaps arising from the increaseoperations tempo requireto meet current threats.	N
I am personally committeto executing this program in the most effective manner possible.	N
My focus will be on program management, effective cost control, integratelogistics support, anplatform effectiveness.	N
I am also convinced, baseon my experiences in the Gulf Coast hurricanes, that we can better exploit the unique operational capabilities inherent in our deployable Coast Guarunits, including our marine safety ansecurity teams, port security teams, anstrike teams.	N
By grouping these capabilities into tailoreforce packages under a unifiechain of command, we can sharpen our own toolkit for maritime disasters anthreat response.	N
If confirmed, my first step will be to align Coast Guardeployable forces internally, anthen seek opportunities to integrate these forces with other DHS anFederal capabilities.	N
We must provide Coast Guarpersonnel the skills, knowledge, ancompetencies needeto effectively contribute to mission execution, and, at the same time, for their individual growth, career development, anlifelong learning.	N
Identification of core competencies needeto operate anmaintain new boats, cutters, aircraft, ansensors must be accelerateto complete--anbe completeto allow delivery of new platforms at full operational capability.	N
And, finally, initiatives to improve law enforcement competencies, language proficiency, anofficer specialty management must continually become institutionalizein our resource system.	N
My final priority is to buila Coast Guarorganizational structure that supports fieloperations anensures mission execution.	N
Every element of our services not involvein mission execution must be aimeat fielsupport, anwe must be internally alignewith DHS support systems.	N
Baseon the new sector mission delivery system anthe new requirements for deployable forces, I will conduct a comprehensive review of existing commanancontrol structures anlogistics anmaintenance systems to ensure that the Coast Guaris optimally organizeto support fieloperations.	N
The Coast Guard's current finance, maintenance, anlogistics systems are baseon platforms, such as aircraft ancutters, not on common functions or processes.	N
This situation, as well as future requirements, require that the Coast Guardevelop andeploy an integratetransformational business architecture that aligns with DHS and, above all, facilitates more effective mission execution.	N
I'like to make a final comment about partnerships anleveraging Coast Guarcompetencies within the Department of HomelanSecurity anthe government.	N
I believe that the Coast Guaris well positioneanuniquely equippeto contribute to the growing relationship between the Department of HomelanSecurity, the Departments of Defense anJustice, anthe Director of National Intelligence.	N
In particular, the recent issuance of a reviseNavy/Coast GuarNational Fleet Policy by the Chief of Naval Operations anthe Commandant focuses on our shareworlof work anthe best combineuse of our respective capabilities ancompetencies in support of the National Strategy for Maritime Security.	N
What do you think about the direction we're going, as far as the Deepwater projects that we believe we shoulbe pursuing?	N
We seem to be upgrading the projects, the existing legacy assets, rather than going into Deepwater.	N
I am committeto doing that anmaking sure those legacy assets get the job done, but getting those new assets online as quickly as we can, sir.	N
What is going to be the policy about the access to the icebreakers for our state anthe Pacific Northwest?	N
Well, sir, I think there's been a dramatic change in the landscape of icebreaking capability anrequirements in the last couple of years.	N
As you know, there was an accommodation made last year to shift funding in the National Science Foundation, to actually bring the money back to the Coast Guarto support our operations.	N
I think, with the growing concern over the shrinking of the Arctic icecap, the continuing issues with resupply of McMurdo Sounanthe South Pole, anthe condition of the icebreakers, I think a national public policy discussion is in order to take a more holistic view of where we neeto go, anwhere we neeto go with all three of the icebreakers, not just the two Polar Class anthe Healy, sir.	N
Well, I can't ask you for comment, but I intento try anreverse that decision that was made last year.	N
The National Science Foundation is also under the jurisdiction of this Committee, but it doesn't have a constant neefor icebreakers.	N
It does, in terms of its scientific expeditions at the North anSouth Poles, but there's still a neefor our Nation to have access to icebreakers, particularly those of us who live in the area I live in, in Alaska.	N
Have you lookeinto that problem, of how we're going to maintain the security of the maritime boundaries in the future?	N
As you know, our commitment right now is to have one cutter on the major boundary line--maritime boundary line, anone in the Bering Sea.	N
Our challenge is, as we decommission the older ships anbring the new ones online, to not break that commitment ankeep that presence up there.	N
That's one reason why we are intending to relocate one of our high-endurance cutters to Kodiak, to replace the--Coast GuarCutter Storrs will be decommissioned, sir.	N
Vice Admiral Allen has a distinguishebackground, and--look forwarto supporting the nomination, look forwarto a robust Coast Guarpresence in North Dakota in the future.	D
Well, between operating that swimming pool in Phoenix anthis thing in North Dakota, if you get arounto it, senanother icebreaker up our way, will you?	N
I want to applauAdmiral Allen for all that he has done on behalf of the Coast Guard, anall that he will do in the future, in his new position as Commandant of the Coast Guard.	D
He has demonstratehis exemplary performance in righting the response to Hurricane Katrina, with his critical role that he playein New Orleans anthroughout the Gulf region during that very difficult andevastating time.	D
AnI look forwarto working with you, Admiral Allen, on so many of the key issues that are confronting the Coast Guarthat demonstrateits superb professionalism andedication anheroism in its response to Hurricane Katrina when it savemore than 33,000 lives.	D
I hope that we will be able to work with you in providing the resources that the Coast Guarrightly deserves, with the Deepwater recapitalization--I hope that we can expedite that timetable--analso to provide you with the interoperability, the commanancontrol, that one Deepwater asset that was in the Gulf at the time was able to provide.	N
The Coast Guard, otherwise, is without it, but made do with what you didn't have, which, again, shows the remarkable dimension of the skills anprofessionalism of the Coast Guard.	D
And, obviously, I think the issue of port security is one of the preeminent concerns, anprobably will be the most critical challenge of your tenure.	N
AnI look forwarto working through some of these issues to ensure that you have the resources to do all that's going to be essential to provide for our homelandefense ansecurity.	N
Fifteen Cuban rafters were clinging to a bridge in the Florida Keys, thinking that they hareacheland.	N
The Coast Guarroundethem up ansent them back to Cuba, under the legal reasoning that since this was the olbridge, the new bridge having been built right beside it, that the olbridge wasn't actually connecteto the land; and, therefore, they hanot reachethe lanside of America.	N
We do not have an opinion from the Department of Justice yet, but I understanit's under review.	N
What was the legal reasoning that you came to that you woulconsider, under the wet foot/dry foot policy, that they hanot reacheAmerica?	N
Well, first of all, Senator, let me just state that I was not at Coast GuarHeadquarters when that occurred.	N
I am a former Seventh District Commander in Miami, anI've been involvein those missions before.	N
But a legal determination was made by our legal staff, ancommunicatedown to the Commander of the Seventh Coast GuarDistrict, who I believe you've already met with, that assimilatethat bridge to being the same as something that was not connecteto land.	N
Anthat was a decision that was made on scene at the time that resultein the migrants being repatriated, sir.	N
Anthe reason I say that is, there are a lot of structures down there that are not connecteto land, and, notwithstanding that that bridge haformerly been connecteto land, we have migrants that are depositeon all forms of structures out there, some of which are very, very unsafe.	N
And, as a general rule down there, anything that's not connecteto lanis not considereto be ``dry feet,'' but there's a safety aspect to this, too, in the precarious position that some of these migrants have been placein by smugglers.	N
Anso, it's entirely--if the law is as stateby this Federal judge, that they were illegally sent back to Cuba--in other words, that they were legally in the UniteStates--they don't have much recourse now.	N
As I said, if there is a different policy guidance that comes out from the current adjudication that's underway, we will take our cue from that.	N
We try not to make policy at the deck plates, but we will responto whatever outcome of the judicial process that occurs.	N
Well, let me ask you, are you familiar with the process, when you pick up a rafter at sea anyou do an investigation on the Coast Guarboat to determine if there is the fear of political persecution if returned, anyou make that determination--you, the Coast Guard, make that determination--before you woulbring them to the immigration authorities in the UniteStates?	N
They're intervieweby an asylum prescreening officer that's provideto us by USCIS, anthe determination on their status is made as a result of those interviews aninteragency consultation.	N
So, in the case of a fellow namede Valle, who was pickeup in 2002 anwas repatriateto Cuba anpromptly thrown into jail, that was a determination made by the immigration department, not by the Coast Guard?	N
There is an interagency discussion between all the respective Departments that have play in that, from a policy standpoint.	N
Guidance then is provideback down to the operational commanders on scene, on whether or not the individual will be repatriateor possibly placeto Guantanamo Bay to potentially go to a thircountry.	N
I was aware that there was an inquiry made today, anI believe we're still looking for information with USCIS on that.	N
I don't have any current information, but we'be glato give you that information after the hearing, sir, once it's developed.	N
Well, since you're going to be the Commandant, these are going to be very poignant anpointeissues that are going to have to be addressed----	N
Senator Bill Nelson.--so that we don't get into this kinof situation, where someone is thrown back into the jaws of a dictator--that, in fact, has reason to believe that they are going to be politically persecuted.	N
Anmy commitment to you is, we'll do it with transparency in the light of the day with the people we serve, sir.	N
Listening to the questioning from Senator Nelson, the Coast Guard, these days, Mr. Chairman, has--it's probably more important than in its entire history of so many centuries in this country.	N
Additionally, you have to worry about stowaways anfiguring out--you finout that some ship that's just leaving someplace hundreds of miles away has a stowaway, anyou're positioning all that.	N
I've visitethe Coast GuarHeadquarters in Norfolk, anit's amazing what you all have to do.	N
Anso diverse, so multifaceted--of course, worrying about hurricanes anstorms anrescues, anthen the refugee issue, as well.	N
AnI think our policy, insofar as those who are escaping for freedom from Castro's regime, is a policy that doesn't make a great deal of sense.	N
It is not, though, in my view, the role of Admiral Allen to change that policy or ignore the policy or not follow the law.	N
It is incumbent on us, as Members of Congress, and, in fact, the President anthe Administration.	N
Anso, I don't know if we'have enough votes to do it, but I think that that policy needs to be reviewed, as far as our standing strong for freedom, justice, annot ask an admiral to look the other way, ignore the laws.	N
You've brought the most credibility andiscipline anstructure ananalysis to that chaos, from those of us watching all arounthe world.	N
But I think--I just think it's a bit unfair to ask him to do that, when we ought to try to do it.	N
I know our colleague, Senator Martinez, is well aware of this, anhas a very personal interest.	D
But thank you for bringing the issue, but I don't--I think you've put him in an untenable position to say, ``Well, that's the law, but try to fina way of administering it differently.''	N
If the Senator woulnotice, the Admiral has answerethe question with regarto the Coast Guardecision of the repatriating of the 15 rafters in early January.	N
He has statethat was a Coast Guardecision, after consultation with their legal counsel.	N
Now that that issue has been brought to full fruition in a Federal court, where the court has saithat the law was not followed, it's certainly worth bringing up that issue, on those kinof interpretations within the Coast Guaritself.	N
Our next nominee is Robert McDowell, nominee to be a Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, to be introduceby Senator Allen.	N
Anthey're raising them on what's left of the farm that--in Northern Virginia where Rob grew up.	N
I'm delightethat President Bush has nominateRob to serve as Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.	N
Rob brings with him approximately 16 years of private sector experience in the communications industry.	D
I think that experience alone makes him a tremendous asset to the Commission, from the perspective that he has had.	D
When I was serving as Governor of Virginia, I actually appointeRob to not one, but two different boards ancommissions, one dealing with combating drugs in Virginia, anthe other as a consumer perspective on the Boarof Contractors.	D
Anhe spent, really, the last three decades serving his Commonwealth, his community, in a variety of different civic ancharitable ways.	D
He went to Duke University in undergraduate school, went to law school at the College of William anMary, where Mr. Jefferson--Thomas Jefferson studielaw.	D
He has serveas outside counsel to numerous technology antelecom companies antrade associations.	D
He's admitteto practice before the Supreme Court of the UniteStates of America, the Supreme Court of Virginia, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the First Circuit, Fourth Circuit, anFifth Circuit, anthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia--a very competent lawyer.	D
AnI think he's going to execute his duties as Commissioner with great ethics, with objectivity, anthe utmost of professionalism.	D
AnI think he'll be striving in these--anyou'll reahis statement, anyou'll hear it--but I think he'll be striving to make sure that all people in this country have the opportunity to benefit from the digital revolution.	D
I think he'll be a devoteana very pragmatic commissioner in the finest anfairest caliber with his knowledge anhis experience.	D
AnI'm speaking for myself, but I know I'm also speaking on behalf of my colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, Congressman Tom Davis, Congressman Wolf, another members of the Virginia delegation, in enthusiastically supporting the confirmation of President Bush's nomination of Rob McDowell on the Federal Communications Commission.	N
And, if I could, may I ask the first question of the witness, Mr. Chairman, because I'm supposeto have left 10 minutes ago?	N
But if I coulask a question, the first question, if you would--leave of court, if it please the court----	N
I didn't--my statement--all the experience you've hain the last 16 years, you have been an advocate for telecom entrepreneurs, for technology entrepreneurs.	N
Anyou may have more experience than any other of the commissioners, as well, in these areas.	N
But I do think it's fair to ask you how you think you'll be able to adjudicate matters objectively anfairly, given your background.	D
I diwant to--I didn't want to have to leave at 4 o'clock without saying that I support Robert McDowell's nomination.	N
I think the President has sent us a nomination that is a solinomination of someone well qualified.	D
Mr. Chairman, I think this Commission now, with a full complement of commissioners, will be making decisions that will have a profounimpact on what the American people see, hear, anreain the coming years, because they're going to be confrontewith this issue of ownership limits.	D
Anthere's not much more important, in my judgment, in our government than getting this right.	N
The Commission has sunk its teeth into it before, been thwarteby the courts, anthwarteby the Congress.	N
I'm not going to ask you specific questions about it, because we haa long talk in my office about that.	N
But concentration in ownership of the media, including television, radio, anthe proposals for cross-ownership with newspapers, it's a very serious issue, because it will have a significant impact on what people in this democracy can see, hear, anread, what information they get.	N
Anthe foundation for democratic self-government is basic information of the American people.	N
AnI'm really especially pleasewe're finally going to have an FCC with all five members seated, present, anwilling to debate anvote on issues.	N
Senator Smith was not able to be here, but he sent a question anaskeme to put it to you.	N
His question is this, ``For those of us in Oregon who have been trying to attract a baseball team for years, we're envious of the fans in cities that actually have a team.	N
I am, however, becoming more concerneabout a tactic that cable companies are using to limit viewership of local sports programming.	N
Then Comcast dithe same thing in Philadelphia with the Phillies, anin Washington, D.C. with the Nationals.''	N
``I understanthat business negotiations can be tough, but blocking game broadcasts has raisereal concerns.	N
We have a hearing this morning on nominations from the President for the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission anthe nominee for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications anInformation.	N
We welcome all of you anthank you for coming, anthank the nominees for their willingness to serve.	D
Kevin Martin is currently serving as Chairman of the FCC, anhas been with the agency since 2001.	D
Prior to joining the FCC, Mr. Martin serveas a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, as well as an advisor to FCC Commissioner HarolFurchtgott-Roth.	D
It is a goomorning, anit's my pleasure to introduce the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, anmy friend, Kevin Martin.	N
I want to take this opportunity--anI will be brief--to strongly recommenthat you confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC.	N
As the FCC Commissioner, Kevin's consistently serveas an ambassador on behalf of the Commission at a time of great change anuncertainty in the worlof telecommunications.	D
He has a unique ability to bring together diverse groups, be they urban or rural or of opposing philosophies, anto forge consensus on complex issues.	D
I've always founhis door, as well as his mind, to be open to all who have haissues anconcerns before the Commission.	N
Throughout his tenure at the FCC, Kevin has hathe best interest of the Commission at heart.	D
Analthough our policy views have differeat times, he's always been thoughtful andiplomatic at exploring these differences.	D
Kevin's vision of the industry he currently regulates, anhis attention to details, make him eminently qualifieanthe best person to leathe Commission anhelp move this industry forwarin the 21st century.	D
Hailing from my home State of North Carolina, I'm prouto call Kevin Martin a fellow North Carolinian, analso a friend.	D
I trust, Mr. Chairman anmy colleagues, that all the members of this committee will confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC as expeditiously as we can.	N
I thank the Chair, anI thank the Committee for their attention to what I believe is absolutely one of the most crucial sectors of our economy, anthat's telecommunications, anthe rules anthe legislation that it takes for that to flourish in the days, weeks, months, anyears ahead.	N
I guess I just neeto say this directly--I don't think that we've haa real concentration on communications policy in this Administration.	N
We've fallen much farther behinEurope anAsia in the next-generation broadbandeployment.	N
I know that many in the industry say that they're doing all that they can, but I, frankly, wouldisagree.	N
I think access to broadbancommunications has to be a matter for rural areas, as well as for urban areas.	N
But a full 25 percent of my constituents in West Virginia have absolutely no access to any form of broadband.	N
I think that Japan is now producing over 90 percent of the world's fiberoptic broadbandeployment.	N
I appreciate the opportunity for the hearing--this is an important position--ancertainly appreciate the introduction of Senator Burr, anwoulagree with Senator Burr that Chairman Martin, among the nominees that we're going to be hearing from today, is amicable, is thoughtful, anhas trieto leathe Commission to the best of his ability.	D
My concern, though, anthe questions that I have today, have to do with policy anwhat kinof policies we're going to pursue, what kinof vision anleadership we're going to have at the FCC, given the current dynamic environment in telecommunications anInternet policy today.	N
But, without a doubt, he has pursuepolicies to restrict marketing of Internet services in an age where those Internet voice services are growing anproviding new opportunities for customers today.	D
Anall the while, I think it's fair to say, the Commission has faileto address some of the enormous inequities we see in the universal service system today.	N
Anthis committee has hahearing after hearing about those problems, about the contribution factor, about weaknesses in distribution, about limitations in access in rural areas.	N
AnI think many of those problems fall on the shoulders of a Universal Service Funthat is failing to meet the valuable objective for which it was established.	N
We have access charges of 10, 12, an14 cents a minute, in parts of the country, that make no economic sense whatsoever.	N
So, I do think these are significant problems in the policy direction that's been establishefor the FCC.	N
They're issues that I've been outspoken on, but I think others in the House anSenate have raisethem, as well.	N
Anthese policies are particularly problematic in an environment where we have enormous growth in services, choices, options for customers, annew entrants.	N
As a result, it's particularly problematic when the FCC seeks to protect existing business models or enforce specific business models on the industry.	N
But I think it's good, from a consumer standpoint, that we have such a proliferation of services anchoices on the Internet, choices and--channels annew products annew content being provideby satellite anby cable anby DSL.	N
Anit's a mistake to look at what we've hain the way of market structure in the past, or rules or regulations in the past, ansay we automatically neeto enforce these business models on any future competitors.	N
There's a great deal of power vestein the FCC, anI think that that power needs to be usevery judiciously.	N
AnI woulhope that, in the comments anthe responses we hear from the Chairman, it's made clear that in a dynamic environment we ought to exercise the utmost restraint in imposing new regulations that will adversely affect the competitive structure.	N
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding hearings on these two very important nominations.	N
AnI hear his daughter is communicating very freely or--is that your daughter or--OK, your son.	N
Annow, more than ever, Americans rely upon various forms of communications to enrich their lives anto conduct their daily business.	N
Whether watching TV or making a call or accessing the Internet, consumers rely on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services.	N
Consumers are counting on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services.	N
Currently, there are a number of communications anmedia issues before the FCC that are of particular interest to the public.	N
These include the FCC's media ownership proceeding, reports that companies are turning customer phone records over to the Federal Government without a warrant, annet neutrality.	N
I'm deeply concernethat a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow.	N
I am deeply concernethat a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow.	N
These media giants already use multiple media outlets to promote their views andominate public debate.	N
Americans have made it clear that a diversity of viewpoints anlocalism are extremely important to them, anI hope the Commission listens.	N
On August the 10th, I sent Chairman Martin a letter urging him to conduct a public hearing in California regarding its recently releasemedia ownership Further Notice of ProposeRulemaking.	N
I'm very pleasethat the Commission just announcethat its very first fielhearing will be helin Los Angeles on October the 3rd.	N
And, having saithat, I hope the Commission will now pay attention to the public at these fielhearings.	N
It's also vital that the FCC aggressively protect the privacy rights anreasonable expectations of consumers.	N
Reports that telephone companies are handing customer information over to the government without a warrant are very troubling, anI hope that the Commission will examine any allegations of such activity.	N
As the heaof the FCC, Chairman Martin is in a unique position to influence the Commission's activities.	N
I have a number of questions regarding these issues another issues, anlook forwarto hearing his answers.	N
He's been nominateto heathe National Telecommunications anInformation Administration, an agency less known to the general public.	N
But as a result of the Deficit Reduction Act, the NTIA has been chargewith a number of new animportant projects, including the establishment of a $1 billion program to promote interoperable communications, something I think we all agree has to happen, anthe establishment of a program to distribute analog-to-	N
So, I'm very interestein hearing from Mr. Kneuer about NTIA's progress on implementing these important programs.	N
I am very interestein a lot of what you've been involvewith, but I want to mention one thing, particularly, today, very quickly, if I can skip arounin my statement.	N
I have been working on, along with a number of members of this committee for the last year, an emergency alert upgrade system callethe WARN Act.	N
It has passethe Committee here, and, with the help of Chairman Stevens anRanking Member Inouye, Ben Nelson, anothers on this committee, it is headefor the floor today to be addeto the port security bill.	N
Anmy concern, at this point, is, the FCC has proceedewith rulemaking on an emergency alert system, similar to the WARN Act, which woulset up a mandatory structure which we believe wouldiminish the potential of a new emergency alert system using wireless technology all across the country.	N
In a number of hearings anmeetings with the wireless networks across the country, the potential of competition for the best system is clearly there.	N
Anmy fear is, if the FCC moves aheawith its own mandates, that we'll enup with another government top-down, one-size-fits-all system that does not use the innovative possibilities that we have.	N
As many of you know who have workeon this bill, the ability, in the event of a terrorist attack or a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, to use wireless technologies to not only be warneof a possible disaster, but to use NOAA information of windirections another available information to tell people which way to evacuate, where fooanshelter is, a lot of other information that we've seen in Katrina another problems, that is not currently available.	N
I believe that if this Federal Government sets up the infrastructure to provide these signals anwarnings, that our free-market economy can create the best delivery systems that the worlhas ever seen.	N
Anmy request today, as we have done to your folks already, is to delay this rulemaking until we see what Congress finishes here before the enof the year, so that we can capture the will of the Congress insteaof a mandate of the FCC.	N
And, again, I look forwarto your confirmation, but woulrequest, I think, as others have today, that we let the free market work anuse government mandates only as the last resort.	N
As Senator DeMint has just said, his amendment is pending on the floor at 10:30, anI will have to leave at that time.	N
AnI want to take the prerogative of the Chair to turn this over to Senator Burns in just a minute.	N
If I may, I'just like to ask a couple of questions before I go manage the bill on the floor.	N
Do you think you have any existing authority to take action if a problem develops before this bill becomes law?	N
In our bill, we develop a new concept for universal service aneliminate the concept that only long-	N
You have discussea reverse auction concept whereby rural telephone companies, wireless companies, another competitors woulcompete for the right to use the Universal Service Fund's support.	N
Well, by definition, an entity with a fixesystem, embeddesystem, having a wireless competitor woulalways lose.	N
If you put it on a competitive basis, I don't see how existing technology can possibly survive against new technology, so you automatically have a revolving door, as far as Universal Service is concerned.	N
But if a small rural carrier in a small community that's met the needs of that community for years is facing a national company that comes in anwants just to replace it completely with a wireless system, ando that nationally, the larger company has got enormous advantage over the local provider.	N
I woulhope you really take a look at the concept of continuity and, really, community presence, because the absentee owner, once they get the ability to serve, they have no further interest in that community, as the local provider who startethe system, does.	N
AnI really think that it's going to be a system whereby the existing local providers are just going to be wipeoff the map.	N
AnGoogle Video anYouTube video services, shoulthe FCC have the power to regulate those?	N
You mentioneuniversal service anyour desire to make some changes with regarto both distribution anrevenue collection, but the FCC keeps raising the contribution factor.	N
We're over 10 percent now, 10 percent Universal Service fee on consumers' use of communications.	N
Senator Sununu.--anis provideto all parts of the country, suburban as well as rural anhigh-cost areas.	N
AnI woulsimply make a point I've made before, is that you suggest you want to be restrictive so that the objectives of this funare directed--or the money in the funds are directed--towarthe key objectives of high-cost areas anrural areas.	N
There's a tremendous amount of money that remains in the hands of districts that don't necessarily fit that description.	N
AnI know there are a lot of technical factors that go into determining how you assess contribution requirements for Universal Service, but the contribution factor for IP voice providers is approximately 65 percent, anthe contribution factor for wireless providers is 37 percent.	N
I'll stipulate both of these are very arbitrary numbers, but it seems extremely disproportionate, aneven punitive, to assign a contribution factor of 65 percent to one, an37 percent to another, when I think it's fair to argue that the overall mix of the kinds of communications that are taking place are quite similar.	N
I respect the fact that you're trying to make a decision baseon data, but it is spurious to make such an important ansignificant financial decision baseon one datapoint.	N
AnI think it runs against common sense to assume that the percentage of interstate communication taking place under IP services is twice that taking place under wireless services.	N
I will agree they might not be equal, but a factor of two to one, I think, really does defy common sense.	N
Chairman Martin anMr. Kneuer, I don't have questions for you, anI apologize, but I'm going to vote for you.	N
It's my understanding you're going to be issuing an order, before too long, with regarto a West Virginia company----	N
We've been working--you've been working with OMB, we've been working together, to try ancraft a letter on the Antideficiency Act--	N
anthat's a very perilous Act--in which case the result of the Act is the opposite of what is intendein the case of the Universal Service Fund.	N
But I think it has to be saithat the OMB appears to be reasonably openly hostile to the Universal Service Fund, and, as is, unfortunate, to the E-Rate program.	N
As you know--anSenator Stevens has left--anhe's been very helpful to us on this question of the appropriation's 1-	N
I have been trying for, I don't know, 10, 12 years, through a crude mechanism callea tax credit--I, along with a whole lot of other people; in fact, I think 75 Members of the Senate--to get broadbandeployment done through a tax credit.	N
AnI'm unhappy to report to you that it hasn't workein any single one of those 10 or 12 years.	N
So, do you think that the Universal Service Funhas, in its range, the possibility of support for broadbaninfrastructure?	N
Do you have the authority to make it a supporteservice, or is that something that has to come from the Congress?	N
I think you have substantial qualifications, anI'm pleasethat you offer yourself for service.	D
Today's monthly trade deficit announcement was $68 billion in a month, highest in history.	N
We are engagein a trade strategy that is fundamentally faulty anis going to be very damaging to this country.	N
AnI know that being involvein the Commerce Department, you will hear people in the Commerce Department marching arounantalking about how wonderful this trade strategy is.	N
But I just wanteto make the point that we've haa pretty devastating announcement this morning about a $68-	N
But, Chairman Martin, you were part of a troika in the FCC that saiit was OK to create new ownership rules so that in one major city one company--one company--coulown eight radio stations, three television stations, the newspaper, anthe local cable company, anthat woulbe just fine, no problem at all.	N
I mean, you're now beginning a new ownership rulemaking process, but do you still feel comfortable suggesting that in one major American city it's fine for one company to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the cable company, the dominant newspaper?	N
Chairman Martin, do you think there's been substantial increaseconcentration in virtually every area of the media?	N
Right now, the media conglomerates--about six of them, essentially: Viacom, Disney, Time Warner, News Corp, CBS, anNBC/General Electric--control the big-four networks, 70 percent of the prime-time television market share, most cable channels, as well as vast holdings in radio, publishing, movie studios, music, Internet, other sectors.	N
Anwhenever somebody talks to me about the--all of the Internet opportunities anso on--I've talkebefore about many voices, one ventriloquist; you can cite many voices, one ventriloquist.	N
Woulyou agree with me that we have seen very substantial concentration in almost every area of the media in recent years?	N
Do you believe that increaseconcentration, in most cases, will likely be moving against the issue of localism, anthat localism--with respect to broadcasting anthe use of the airwaves that belong to all of the American people--localism is essential ancentral to the notion of what broadcasting is about?	N
It's--in fact, Chairman Powell starteit, anthen just droppeit, it just sat there, annothing happened.	N
It woulmake much more sense to complete the proceedings on owner--on localism, rather, before you decide on ownership, wouldn't it?	N
Since the Chairman startetalking about net neutrality in his first question to you, I want to--when the FCC decidethat broadbanshoulbe removefrom Title II of the Telecommunications Act, ansaiit is no longer a telephone service, but an information service, that took from it, then, the attachment to nondiscrimination.	N
Nondiscrimination rules applied, up until that point, to all that was describeas a telephone service; nondiscrimination rules no longer applieonce it was taken out of that definition.	N
Anwhen the FCC made its decision, then the nondiscrimination rules that diattach at that point dinot continue to attach.	N
Woulyou agree that the television advertisements that ran during our markup, this committee's markup, on the issue of net neutrality--the television commercials that ran, that indicatethat the principles that you have establisheincludenondiscrimination principles--that those television commercials were inaccurate?	N
Chairman Martin, you anthe Commission will make some of the most important decisions that will be made, in terms of the development of information in this country.	N
Anit seems to me, further concentration in the media, having fewer anfewer people determine what we see, hear, anreain this country, is antithetical to everything we shoulbelieve in that fosters annurtures democracy.	N
AnI hope as you anthe other commissioners sift through these, you will keep that in mind.	N
AnI hope as you have six hearings arounthe country, the first of which will be in Los Angeles, you will holone in a rural state, a rural area, as well, to allow us to weigh in on these things.	N
Anlet me finish with at least one bone here, anthat is, your predecessor helonly one hearing anthen moveahead.	N
Some of us will want to holyou up even more, to the extent we can, to slow you down anhope you reach the right conclusion.	N
I mentionethe WARN Act in my statement, the emergency alert system that we've been working on here in Congress, anobviously the FCC has an interest in that anhas begun the rulemaking process.	N
Our request is that you--as you statein your statement, as you mentioned, the will of Congress shoulbe expressesometime in November.	N
And, we believe, before the enof this year, we will have expressethe will of Congress.	N
On the content side, do you believe a content provider, such as Google, shoulhave the right to charge its customers more for prime placement on its pages than those who don't have prime placement?	N
Do you think a network provider, such as Verizon, shoulhave the freedom to charge more for higher requirements, such as video, from its customers?	N
So, you think network providers, if they are offering higher-speeoptions andifferent types of products, that they can price those differently.	N
AnI think, as you know, what you just saiis opposeto the concept of network neutrality.	N
AnI was happy to see that you hapullefrom the agenda the vote on additional must-carry privileges.	N
As we move towarcreating more cable competition, more video options in the marketplace, obviously we think it--at least a number of us do--think this is not the time to go in anmandate that our retailers of video services are requireto carry different options by their customers, when we think that's going to happen naturally.	N
But is it fair to say--do you intento bring multicast must-carry up for a vote again at the Commission?	N
And, by the way, I have questions for both of you, so I'm going to stay a seconrounif my time runs out.	N
When the FCC releaseits media ownership decision in 2003, Congress anthe courts criticizethe Commission for serious problems.	N
In then-Chairman Powell's words, quote, ``In the months that followed, we hearthe voice of public concern about the media louanclear.	N
You said, Mr. Martin, ``What local broadcasters provide in terms of local news aninformation to the community is really important.''	N
Now, in August 2003, the FCC establishea Localism Task Force to study issues like the impact of media consolidation on local news programming.	N
It is now 3 years later, anwe haven't seen a release of any report or any policy recommendations from the staff.	N
I mean, I'm very happy with what you're going to do, but I think there's work that's been done, anit's been stifled.	N
But I have a copy of a draft report, dateJune 17, 2004, ``Do Local Owners Deliver More Localism?	N
Well, I'm going to ask you to please go back, after you look at it again--I'm going to ask the--all the other commissioners to tell me if they ever saw this report, because, according to it, ``Local ownership''--this is a quote--``adds almost 5 anone-half minutes of local news anover 3 minutes of local on-location news.	N
In the course of a year, this means locally ownestations provide over 33 more hours of regional news, news that's directly relevant animportant to viewers.''	N
I mean, this is important information about issues that are key to the people--I woulsuspect, your own mom, who lives in rural America.	N
You know, it seems to me--anmaybe I'm just a cynic; I've been here a long time--that, you know, this comes out with a very clear response to the question of consolidation versus localism.	N
But I'm sure glasomebody out there sent this to me, because I think this is news, that this kinof work has never seen the light of day.	N
They went out, anthey dia real goostudy of this, anthey founout that there's more local news.	N
Our team seems to be falling apart, so, you know, our batting order's going to pick up here a little bit.	N
AnChairman Martin, thank you for your interest in always trying to reach out anwork with me in various capacities.	N
Let me follow up on one of Senator Sununu's questions of a few moments ago on the Internet.	N
Let me get to a more specific question about the Internet, anthat's decency on the Internet.	N
Do you think that we, as in the Congress or the FCC or the folks that are--the Internet industry, so to speak--do you think we shoultry to make the Internet a more decent place?	N
I know there's been a media campaign through the ACouncil, et cetera, about parental controls on televisions, anusing cable ansatellite, et cetera.	N
What's your assessment of that public relations campaign anthe effectiveness of it, as it stands today?	N
The Committee's heara lot of discussion about the Texas video franchising law, anI'like to get--as a Federal regulator, I'like to get your impressions of the Texas video franchising, about--has it increaseconsumer choice?	N
Chairman Stevens, a few moments ago, mentionethat net neutrality has been a very sticky wicket for this Committee anfor the telecommunications bill.	N
AnI think it's one of the major holdups on getting telecommunications done this year on the Senate floor.	N
Personally, I like the FCC's approach, where you define two or three--I guess, three different items.	N
Given your experience on the FCC in net neutrality, how has--from your perspective, how has the FCC approach worked, so far?	N
AnI've--I got to watch those babies go back anforth, anI said, ``Welcome to the Senate Daycare Center.''	N
I've got an important press conference--has to do with agriculture; anso, I take my agriculture pretty serious--anI'm going to submit my questions, but I want Mrs. Boxer to ask her--she's got a couple of more questions.	N
But I want to give you an idea of what I'll be asking, anI want you to responboth to the Committee anto me.	N
Well, we'll get back to you on that, because the decisions I know basically say that, you know, you coulproceed.	N
But I feel like Mr. Kneuer has been left out of this, anhe has a very important job, because he will be establishing a $1-billion public-safety interoperability grant program, ana lot of us, in a bipartisan way, are concernethat our first responders can't talk to each other.	D
So, how soon after October 1st will the NTIA be prepareto distribute grants to public-safety entities, Mr. Kneuer?	N
So, how soon--I hate to cut you off, but I'm running out of time--how soon can we see these grants being distributeto public-safety entities?	N
that we have to prepare for an attack, that our law enforcement has to talk to each other.	N
So, will you please write to me within the next week or so angive me the projectedate that you will be ready to hanout these grants?	N
Mr. Kneuer, I'm going to--I have a couple of questions for Chairman Martin, anit has to do with the VoIP 911 order ansubsequent filings anthis type thing.	N
Senator Hutchison has submittea statement for the recorin support of your nomination, Mr. Chealander, anit will be includein the record.	N
That will be the policy of the Committee, unless we hear from the Committee Members through their staffs that there is any objection to any of those.	N
We will also do our best to get your two nominations dischargeso that we can consider them before we adjourn.	N
It's with great pleasure, Mr. Chairman, I introduce to the Committee Mary Peters, who has been nominated, as you well know, as the 15th Secretary of the Department of Transportation.	N
And, of course, all of us are familiar with Mary through her nearly 4 years of service as the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration from 2001 to 2005.	D
She's a fourth-generation Arizonan, was the director of the Arizona Department of Transportation, known as ADOT, prior to taking the helm of the Highway Administration.	D
She gainenearly 16 years of firsthantransportation agency experience during her service at the Arizona Department of Transportation, ananother 4 years at the Federal Highway Administration.	D
I appreciate very much the President of the UniteStates selecting such an outstanding ancapable individual to fill this important leadership position.	D
AnI woullike very much that this committee approve, or consider anthen approve, her nomination as quickly as possible, as I think it woulbe goofor the country to have her on the job before we go out for recess.	N
Mr. Chairman, first let me agree with my colleague Senator McCain that it woulbe very much in the best interests of this country if the nomination of Mary Peters coulmove forwarvery expeditiously, first through the Committee anthen on to the floor of the Senate.	N
My colleague, of course, tracethe career of Mary Peters, a distinguishecareer focuseon transportation issues.	N
When she was here in Washington as the heaof the Federal Highway Administration at DOT, among other things she leefforts to improve the safety ansecurity of our country's highways anbridges, reduce congestion, aninstitutionalize better fiscal oversight anaccountability.	D
Anshe distinguisheherself in the same way when she headethe Department of Transportation in the State of Arizona.	D
But, for my place, I couldn't recommenmore strongly someone who has all of the attributes, not just the skills anthe experience, but the personal qualities to be a part of the President's Cabinet, to be advising him, to working with Members of Congress.	D
Anso, when, once again, she agreeto answer the President's call to leave the warm ansunny weather of Arizona to come back to Washington, I applaudeher choice, anI urge the Committee to act quickly so that she can begin her responsibilities here as soon as possible, serving the people of this country.	D
She's a person of great integrity ancharisma, anI'm very prouto call her a frienancommenher to the Committee.	D
I woulsuggest that the nominee present her statement, then we'll go arounangive Senators an opportunity to question the nominee.	N
Senator Lott.--being nominateby the President to this very important position as Secretary of Transportation.	N
Mr. Chairman, I've haoccasion in the past to work with the nominee when she was at the Federal Highway Administration, anI founit to be a very satisfactory relationship, anwe actually producea result, anit leto a completion of a project that habeen in the mill for 40 years.	D
I don't want to ask a lot of questions now, because a lot of the questions I woulask you woulbe in areas that you may not have been involvein in the past.	N
But let me just say that, as I tolthe nominee when I met with her, I think transportation is a critical part of our society anour economy.	N
I think it's the best department in the government, in terms of actually creating jobs andoing things for people.	N
But I just believe that we neeto have an agenda, a plan, anwe neeto be forward-leaning when it comes to transportation anhow we builour roads anbridges, andoing more in the aviation area.	N
We have an air traffic control system that is just not up to the standards that we're going to have to have.	N
We have haimprovements in railroads, the short lines anthe big freight lines, but we neeeven more.	N
Do we want it to be able to provide gooservice, on-time service, you know, with input from the states anthe passengers, or not?	N
Now, I can just say that in Congress we're going to provide initiatives in all these areas.	N
As a member of the Finance Committee, we have a tax incentive proposal to greatly encourage the freight railroads to expantheir capacity.	N
So, as our new Secretary of Transportation, I challenge you to get holof this issue anget us moving forward.	N
AnI think you're going to have to speak to the White House anOMB a little bit, because they're not going to want to spensome of the money.	N
But there is never a better dollar spent, other than for defense, than the money we spenon lanes, planes, trains, ports, anharbors.	N
Just a couple of specific questions with regarto your appointment to the National Surface Transportation Policy anRevenue Study Commission.	N
anit involves a conversion on my own part--is my concern about safety in all of these areas--in trains, in planes, analso in the highways.	N
Aninsteaof trying to punish them or threaten them or beat them into submission, we gave them incentives, that if you pass the comprehensive seatbelt laws, you'll get a little extra money.	N
Anmy state, which is always recalcitrant on being tolby the Federal Government what we have to do, within 6 months diit.	N
Anwe've seen, already, an improvement in our statistics with regarto seatbelt use by people involvein accidents.	N
We also have askeyour department, the appropriate department, to look at some other safety proposals to see how it might work with regarto chilsafety ansome of the rearview activities anhow kids accidentally can knock cars out of park anhave them roll forwarankill children.	N
So, I hope that you will also take a look at some of these safety initiatives that are being considered.	N
I don't advocate doing them just for appearance's sake, but if we can do some things that woulhelp in that area, I think it woulbe a very goothing for you to focus on.	N
I think she has very substantial experience directly in these areas, so I think this is a goonomination.	D
AnI woulalso join my colleague Senator McCain in suggesting that it woulmake sense for us to move quickly on this nomination.	N
I think having vacancies in these top positions in agencies is a hindrance, anI woulhope we woulmove quickly on it.	N
We have, in western North Dakota aneastern Montana, particularly in the Williston area, an Essential Air Service contract connecting Williston anDickinson, to Denver, anthat contract--they haattempteto have a thirflight a day when it was reauthorizea few years ago.	N
Since that time, there has been substantial activity in the oil patch, anour region has increaseridership over 23 percent in one city, an12 percent in another.	N
AnI want to work with you anvisit with you about that, because we neeto connect that increasing activity in the oil patch to the hub in Denver with better EAS service.	N
I also want to mention, on Amtrak, if I can, the Empire Builder, which runs from--it affects a number of us on this committee--it runs from Chicago to Seattle.	N
The previous Secretary, Norm Mineta, whom you succeeded, once said, ``Trains that nobody wants to ride''--he was talking about long-distance trains, anusethe Empire Builder as an example--``Trains that nobody wants to ride.''	N
Anobviously Secretary Mineta didn't know what he was talking about, hadn't done his research.	N
Zeroing out Amtrak funding or coming in with a proposal that woulessentially eliminate all long-distance trains is not the way I think the majority on this committee believes we shoulapproach this.	N
Anthen, Senator Inouye has been very active--anI have joinehim--on this issue of a rulemaking with respect to foreign control of U.S. airlines.	N
I talketo you about a radar issue at--in our state, as well, at the Bismarck Commerce Center.	N
But, having saiall of that, I--you know, Mr. Chairman, we have a lot of nominees that come to the Congress who are marginally qualified--I shouldn't say ``a lot,'' but a number of times someone's frienis nominated.	N
You have a depth of experience, I think, in transportation issues that's very, very important.	D
I do want to mention one additional thing, anthat is the issue of surface transportation, the STB, with respect to railroads.	N
Again, my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, anmyself, have workelong anharon the issue of captive shippers.	N
Anto say that the STB does nothing is to give them much greater credit than they deserve.	N
It's an unbelievably inept agency that--I mean, glaciers move more rapidly than the STB on very serious issues that they are confrontewith.	N
So, those of us on this committee, on a bipartisan basis, who push antry to cajole anforce the actions on some of the important things for captive shippers, who are really, literally helcaptive anare paying a massive amount of extra money--our Public Service Commission estimates that North Dakotans are overchargeby $100 million--$100 million a year.	N
And, again, on a bipartisan basis, Members of this committee woulvery much like some action.	N
That falls under your jurisdiction, at some point here, anwe hope to be able to visit anwork with you on all of these things.	N
I wanteto at least alert you to those issues of interest from the standpoint of one rural state, North Dakota.	N
AnI look forwarto working with you, anI will look forwarto seeing that--if we can get this nomination to the Senate as expeditiously as possible.	N
I woulsay, Ms. Peters, that if we're going to have a vote on you after our next vote, that your situation doesn't sounexactly dire to me.	N
But the thing that struck me most about you is your openness, your--the sense of transparency about you, anthat you, kinof, look for the right solutions, anyou're willing to stanby them, anyou're plainspoken in the way you do it.	D
That drives most of our colleagues on this committee crazy, but it ought to drive all of them, I think, in the direction of trying to solve this, anit's a very--it's a very simple thing.	N
Staggers, who is a West Virginian--that Staggers Deregulation Act of 1984, everybody got deregulateif there were two lines going into a business, but the 20 percent who weren't didn't get deregulated.	N
Anthat's--when he was referring to the STB--ICC, before that--there's never been any movement on that.	N
Anthe railroads always have inadequate revenues, anthen, as you're discussing that, you open up their annual reports, anthe revenues are overflowing in all directions.	N
If his are 100 million, that means, probably, ours are more, because there are so many chemicals ancoal antimber that comes out of our state--car parts, all kinds of things.	N
AnI think it's just a question of a Cabinet officer, sort of, grappling with that issue.	N
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison isn't here today, but, you know, Houston was just in a mess--or parts of Texas were in a mess when a certain situation happenedown there.	N
I met with the heaof one of the big railroads this morning, anhe seemevery open, accommodating in his attitude.	N
It isn't gooenough to, sort of, take an individual industry which is having a problem anthen make an accommodation to them, because that slides past the real problem.	N
I woulalso mention the safety of motorists anpedestrians who--at rural rail crossings.	N
Anit's a--it's not just you, it's the DHS, Coast Guard, TSA, the Corps of Engineers, all kinds of other folks, local also, anthe behavior of people.	N
AnI won't ask for an answer right now, but I woulactually appreciate if you would, maybe, senme a letter giving me some of your thoughts on what we do about that, because the costs involveanthe safety involved--like you mentioned, the chilwith the seatbelt--well, this is, sort of, Americans with a seatbelt for a perioof a number of yards.	N
Another issue that I wouljust bring up is the--something that we face very much in West Virginia, where we have--only 4 percent of West Virginia is flat.	N
Anso, that means that when you have as many chemicals as we do, up andown the Ohio, anthen into the interior anthe Kanawha River, so, it was really the foundation state for chemicals--anso, there's the question of, what do you do when there's an incident, whether it's a terrorist attack or whether it's just a car that overturns?	N
I am ranking on the Aviation Subcommittee here, anwe've seen that the aviation industry has been turneupside-down, as you very well know.	N
Anits budget--the FAA's budget for dealing with these things--the Congress has consistently rejectecuts to airport construction funding.	N
AnI want you to be sensitive to--you know, we've haall kinds of things that have been taken from our budget, but some of these things affect Americans every single day.	N
And, with that, I'just say that if you woulthink about those, responto me on the rail-crossing thing, anto say that I'm going to very proudly vote for you.	N
We've got our regional jets now, not big--not as big as airports, but making more frequent flights.	N
Angeneral aviation--how general aviation is treated, it will play, I think, an even larger role in the years to come.	N
Anif decisions are made in the Department of Transportation, in the FAA, or wherever, we've got to make sure that the big anthe small are considered, anto be at the table.	N
Anas we talkeabout--in surface transportation, I think we're going to be facing great challenges in the terms of capacity constraints in our network.	N
The next 20 years, freight shipments are expecteto dramatically increase, placing serious demands on roads, aviation, rail, anwaterways.	N
My particular concern, as you know, relates to the role of what freight rates--or the freight railways play in our nation's infrastructure.	N
But most of those limitations are a symptom of a much larger problem, the lack of meaningful competition for rates anservice in many parts of our country, especially Montana, anI think Senator Dorgan alludeto that for North Dakota a little while ago.	N
We've got to remember, the other day, the Surface Transportation Boarissuesome rules on trying to deal with small shippers, that they may have a place to obtain, but it's anything under $200,000.	N
But one has to remember that it is in the law now, in Section 10101, in Title 49 of the U.S. Code-- ``...it is the policy of the UniteStates Government to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition anthe demanfor services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail.''	N
But there's also another line to that, ``to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition.''	N
And--because it's being reflectenot only in our grain that we ship from the State of Montana to our ports, but the energy, the coal we ship from our--from ours that goes into--that goes into electricity.	N
Anwe have to deal--now, we have to deal with it in the context of what's goofor the railroad, too, because we cannot operate without goorail service.	N
Anso, we have to finsome way--some way that the small anthe large can survive, analong with our railroads, even our short lines anhow we handle that.	N
Anthere are certain things that we can do, anwe shouldo in the near future, in order to address those problems anstill take care of the infrastructure that they neeto improve their capacity to move freight by surface transportation.	N
Amtrak, I will tell you, I want you to move some folks down to the Department of Transportation.	N
Aneverybody says there's no--there's nobody who rides those trains across--the Empire Builder.	N
So, those are the areas that I think--anI look forwarin working with you in all of these challenges.	N
She has actually been to South Carolina to work on some innovative transportation solutions.	D
I think we all know that the federal Department of Transportation can do only so much, anI think it was the thought of considering taking some of the roaresponsibilities back to local anstate governments while we look at national infrastructure for rail anwhat we're going to do with aviation may make sense at this time--anshe seems willing to look at some innovative ideas.	N
AnI join my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, in looking forwarto voting affirmatively for your confirmation.	N
As we spoke in my office about a range of issues from planes, trains, anautomobiles, you've got a huge job.	N
There are now reports coming out that the Highway Trust Funwill be out of money by, or short of money by 2008.	N
We previously spoke of the I-5 Columbia River corridor that connects the States of Washington anOregon, anthe congestion is so bathere that by 2 in the afternoon it's a parking lot, anyet, it is a vital link for commerce antransportation in our country.	N
So, obviously, I'm anxious to work with you anto learn of any ideas you have to help us to alleviate the congestion on our highways anhow we're going to finance it.	D
On the Finance Committee we recently implementea tax credit for the railroads to invest in rails, anwe find, in the operation of that tax credit, that much of it was nullifieby the AMT.	N
The IRS is now coming out with a ruling further restricting it, and, therefore, frustrating the very unanimous--or near unanimous intent of Congress.	N
Anything you can do to help us come up with ideas for how we can obtain more investment in rails, both cross-country anshort line, woulbe appreciated.	N
It is critical to relieve congestion on our highways anto increase efficiency in our transportation means.	N
It looks like you have made a lot of friends in your private discussions, anI, sort of, feel the same way, but I've got a couple of questions to ask.	N
The fact of the matter is that, while we can't do much about the destruction that we get from extreme weather another conditions beyonour control, we can do things to provide transportation.	N
AnI'like to know that you're going to tackle all the problems that exist for every mode of transportation.	N
You certainly have experience on the highway side of things, but future transportation needs of our country will not be met by highways alone.	D
And, you know, I'm very concerneabout Amtrak, anlisten with interest as other Senators from other parts of the country beside the Northeast have shown today a serious interest in seeing that Amtrak continues to operate anappropriate investments are being made to bring it up to date.	N
But the budgets tell us the true story, that in a single year we spenmore on highways than we've spent on Amtrak improvement over the last 35 years.	N
Right now we're trying to finroom in our national airspace for all the flights that we have--by reducing separations anlimiting flights at certain airports.	N
At Newark, for instance, Federal Aviation Administrator Blakey has saiwe nee35 controllers for safe operations, but we're 15 percent short.	N
It goes back a few years, but it is about the safety concerns with heavier, longer trucks.	N
You wrote ``rollovers anjack-knifings by trucks already''--this was, again 7 years ago--``already a problem on our interstates anour highways.	N
In addition to safety consequences, we're remindeabout the effect of additional weights on our highway facilities, especially bridges.''	N
Anso, we've discusseshortages in FAA controllers, the search for more capacity in the airspace, on the freight rail lines, andealing with the congestion anpollution that we now get from jammehighways.	N
Senator Lott anI have a bill that's sponsoreby many of our friends here to get Amtrak the Federal funding that woulpermit it to operate without having to go out there with a tin cup every time they neesomething.	N
So, I'm hoping, Ms. Peters, that you will join us in that quest to make sure that Amtrak gets the investment that it needs to bring our country's passenger railroaup to date.	N
I'd--if there are plans, I'be curious about what statutory authority there is to do that.	N
I'say this, that--anI look forwarto working with you on this, but I woulsay this, that if DOT is planning on moving forward, the kinds of things I woulwant to know is, what legal authority is there?	N
Anthen I woulwant to know, is there some sort of agreement with Mexico to allow U.S. safety inspectors anauditors to look at the trucks?	N
Woulthey have to pay all the same fees, the various registration, fuel taxes, those kinof things?	N
Woulthey have to do the international registration plan, the IRP, anthe internal fuel tax agreement?	N
Woulthey have to comply with all the same rules anregs that the U.S. carriers woulhave to?	N
So, as you look at that, I woulvery much appreciate having a dialogue with your Department anthose agencies as that is being developed.	N
Anthe other thing I wanteto touch on, something you anI talkeabout several days ago, is the real infrastructure needs that we have in this country.	N
In some of my reading, I reawhere you saithat we can't depenon the Federal Government to bring the money in, that it was around--that was arounwhen the interstate system was first built.	N
When you say, ``We can't depenon the Federal Government to have that same kinof money when the interstate system was first built,'' what does that mean?	N
That sounds like toll roads, to me, but I'm curious to hear your response on how you think the Federal Government will--or we, as a Nation--will pay for these transportation needs that we have.	N
Anyou certainly come with, you know, the highest level of commendation with respect to your past accomplishments anexperience, so I'm very pleasethat you'll become the next Secretary of Transportation because of your breadth of expertise in the areas that are going to be so critical to the future.	D
I know some of my other colleagues on the Committee have already referenceit, anI'm very pleaseas well that we hathe opportunity to meet recently on some of the issues that I consider to be critical, certainly to my State of Maine, as also to, I think, the national transportation policy.	N
But obviously as we look to the future, one of the concerns that I had, anI've expressed, is making sure that, you know, rural states like Maine are not forgotten in the overall transportation policy.	N
First of all, as I mentioneto you about Amtrak--anwe were fortunate to be one of the last states to have the benefit of an extension of Amtrak from Boston to Portland, anit's extremely successful, has a 92-percent, you know, customer satisfaction rate, because of the outstanding services provideto the people of Maine anthe vicinity.	N
It's workeexceedingly well, so much so that we're looking to extenit even further up into the State.	N
Anone of the reasons for its success, as I mentioneto you, was the Federal waiver that was granteto the State to use the Congestion Mitigation anAir Quality funds for that purpose, anthat will expire in 2009.	N
Can you state for this committee what your views are with respect to the use--the flexibility using Federal transportation funds for this purpose?	N
Because that certainly has contributeto the success for the Downeaster, the extension of Amtrak to Maine, ancertainly will in the future, anif--particularly if we want to extenthat service even further up because it's so heavily utilizeby the people in New England, in my state.	N
You know, I happen to believe in--anI gather you share that belief, as well--that it is essential that the Federal Government play a role in creating a strong national rail system.	N
It is absolutely essential that we have one, anone that--obviously, that's going to provide--that's going to have the benefit of Federal support.	N
You know, hopefully we can move, you know, further anfurther away from, you know, huge Federal subsidies.	N
But, nevertheless, I think it's so vital ancentral to our overall transportation policy.	N
Second, on aviation, rural aviation--and, again, I know my colleagues have raisethis issue, but I do think it is paramount--anthat is, of course, regional airports, such as those that exist in Maine, or Essential Air Service communities that depenupon the Essential Air Service, you know, funding.	N
Anone, of course, is the fact that--first, referring to the operational evaluation plan--it seems that much of the focus in the past of--by these plans--ancertainly the most recent, focuseon the large hub airports--understandably so, because of the congestion that exists at these hub airports.	N
But, on the other hand, what concerns me is what is occurring in, you know, my state with the small regional airports, is that we're, you know, losing--a loss of seats anoverall--both in terms of flights anseats in passenger service--there's no question that our airports have been very harhit over the years, anyet it's pivotal ancentral to economic development.	N
So, I woullike to get your views--one, in terms of examining, you know, how you incorporate, you know, regional airports anthose that serve the rural states of this country, in the overall plans for the future.	N
AnI hope you will give that consideration, since they play a premier role in the development of our economies, as does the Essential Air Service program that--you know, Maine is one of the--other than four other states, we're the largest beneficiaries of that program.	N
I'm also concerneabout the Administration's proposed, you know, community cost-sharing between the Federal Government--in some cases as much as 80/20.	N
It's something that we have rejectein the past, ancertainly, hopefully, will do so in the future, because I think that places an inordinate burden on those communities that depenon the EAS program.	N
But in--it's obvious it's going to have a paramount impact on them if they have to--if they have to provide for the cost-sharing anthey see a reduction in the overall program, which--the Administration has submitted, you know, a program ana budget for that, for less than, I think, half of what exists today.	N
Anthe matter of foreign ownership of our airlines, ownership ancontrol, that's a matter of great concern to me, anto many of us.	N
AnI'be wary anresistant to the notion that we might turn over--let control be taken by foreign owners.	N
But do you intento--if you're confirmed, to pursue changes in the rules on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines?	N
You're aware of the fact that there is a strong interest, in our region, to open up another rail tunnel under the Hudson River---- 	N
Senator Lautenberg.--so that we can increase the capacity to allow enough trains to go through there.	N
AnI'like to know that you will at least consider seriously the requests for help from you to make sure that we get going with that project.	N
That's a project of national interest, even though the tunnel is between New York anNew Jersey, because right now it is the biggest bottleneck on the entire Northeast Corridor from here to Boston.	N
Anso, can I have an indication of the fact that you're--that you understanthe neefor this tunnel anwill be helpful to us as we pursue a way to get it done?	N
Now, I don't want to ask any questions that might be interpreteas being on the personal side, but you're a motorcycle rider, are you not?	N
The helmet that I was wearing was 2 days old, anI've been skiing 60 years, anit virtually savemy life.	N
We do have a fairly bipartisan approach to many issues, particularly in transportation here in this committee.	N
I look forwarto working with you, along with our Co-Chairman anmembers on both sides of the aisle.	N
Today my oldest son Christopher came to Washington with family including one of his colleagues from a high school he just graduatefrom last week.	N
During the course of lunch anthe time on the Hill, they met a lot of our Senators who've seen my boys grow up over the years through our Christmas cards aneveryone remarkehow big he's gotten to be, anhe's tall, he's like 17 years olanhe's taller than his daanI think a whole lot smarter, too.	N
They marvel at how quickly these children grow up--is this the little boy that I remember that was born when you were in the House of Representatives?	N
Today, I'm privilegeto introduce the son of one of our colleagues, Joe Biden, who's here today along with his wife, Jill to support Hunter Biden.	N
Hunter Biden is a native Delawarian anI woulgo on to say that he's also been nominateto serve on the Amtrak Boarof Directors.	N
When Hunter was unable to get into the University of Delaware, he insteawent on to Georgetown anthen to Yale Law School anmanageto get through those OK.	N
He's endeup being Senior Vice President at MBNA one of the largest financial institutions in the country.	N
He serveas Executive Director of Economy Policy Coordination at the U.S. Department of Commerce.	D
About 5 years ago he went off anformea law firm here in Washington, D.C., annow they represent over 100 clients including a bunch of non-profit organizations aneducational institutions.	D
More specifically, though, anfor our purposes anfor the purpose of this nomination, Hunter Biden has spent a lot of time on Amtrak trains.	D
Like his father, like our Congressman, Mike Castle anmyself, Hunter Biden has livein Delaware while using Amtrak to commute to his job as we commute to our job in Washington almost every day of the week.	D
You know, you learn a lot about what coulwork anwhat woulwork better at Amtrak by riding trains antalking to the passengers, the commuters, the passengers, the folks who work on the trains anmake them work every day.	N
You also have a chance to see the huge economic benefit the region receives from having a strong passenger rail corridor, something that shoulbe available in a lot of other parts of our country.	N
The seconreason I am pleaseto see this nomination move forwaris I believe it shows a beginning to move back towara bipartisan direction at least with respect to this particular board.	N
The Amtrak Boarhas traditionally haboth Democratic anRepublican members, but for the past several years, it has been partisan anit has been incomplete.	N
Last November, my colleagues recall that 93 members of the Senate, supporteAmtrak reauthorization, legislation introduceby Senator Lautenberg, co-sponsoreby myself, anI know many Members of this Committee.	N
Passenger rail, like highways anairports, is not a partisan issue anshouldn't be a partisan issue anit's a mode of travel that we believe is gaining popularity in a time when commuters are being pincheby high gas prices anfrustratewith highway anairport congestion.	N
Finally, as we confirm a full, bipartisan Boarat Amtrak, that Boarwill be more able to take on the difficult issues that face Amtrak, from tackling long-deferremaintenance, modernizing the system nationwide anaddressing demanfor new anexpandeservice across the country on already stretchefreight tracks.	N
A full bipartisan Boarthat has been duly confirmeby this Senate will have the credibility needeto take on these challenges anmove Amtrak anour country into the 21st century.	N
Anwhile we are tackling these challenges, it will be comforting for the millions of Amtrak riders ancommuters to know that one of their own, Hunter Biden, will be on the Boarof Directors.	N
And, if I couljust say it's a point of personal privilege, I have been privilegeto have livein Delaware since 1973, since I got out of the Navy, anJoe Biden was one of the first people I met when I arrivethere.	N
He anJill have raisetwo boys ana girl that any of us woulbe prouto call our own anI am.	N
It's deeply a privilege to sit here today before them anbefore you to be able to offer him as our candidate from Delaware to serve on this board.	N
Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for this opportunity to congratulate all of the nominees that have been selecteto serve in positions that are very critical to our transportation system.	N
Of course, when someone says that to you, anyou've been arounhere long enough to know better, they'll usually say something pleasant before the rest comes.	N
I just wanteto raise a question--anI don't want to pick on anybody in particular, Mr. Chairman--but let me start with Mr. Hill's thoughts on several issues.	N
I'like to hear about them, regarding, as a result of the job that he has held, the size anweight of trucks, particularly since Secretary Mineta commentelast week that he'consider expanding the use of triple trailer vehicles.	N
AnI woulhope that the Nation's top truck safety advocate wouldn't be advocating a change that might include some new safety risks on the road.	N
In terms of my interest, as you know very well, Mr. Chairman, I think everybody pretty much does when it comes to Amtrak, I'm glato see that we're going to be filling two of these posts anlook forwarto having a chance to chat with them.	N
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your ever dutiful response to issues that we're concerneabout anthis hearing is one of them.	N
Thank you very much, so what we intento do is to go through each member anas you're introduceanwe hear from you, we hope that you will start off by introducing your parents anfamily with you, some famous some infamous ansome you don't want to introduce anyway, but do it, well, do it.	N
That means that we're starting with Hunter Biden anDonna McLean, who have been nominateto the Amtrak Reform Boaranwill serve for 5 years if confirmed.	N
It is a controversial subject of discussion for this Committee, anI'm sure that you'll have some questions as we go forward.	N
Senator Carper has introduceyou, Mr. Biden anSenator Lugar has sent a statement in support of Ms. McLean.	N
I've known you longer than you've been alive, Hunter, so if you want to introduce your family, anI think you can ignore your dad, I think we know him.	N
Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman, I think aviation to Alaska compares very much to rail for New Jersey.	N
We probably have more flights per square acre, if one can measure that, than any state in the country.	N
We have four significant airports starting with Newark, the biggest, Atlantic City International, Morristown Airport, anTeterboro Airport that are largely usefor general aviation anindustry.	N
I'm very much concerneabout Amtrak anI woulsay that the focus on reform that the Chairman raisehere, may be interpretedifferently by different folks.	N
That coulbe a final ``improvement'' that woulresult in the railroanot existing anymore.	N
Hunter--I woulcall you Mr. Biden, but I'be afraiyour father woulstanup--so I'm going to call you Hunter, anbesides we've known each other such a long time--I'm pleaseto see you here anwith the understanding that you have so well, of what Amtrak means to states like Delaware anthen we go on to New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, you name it, in the most densely populatearea of the country.	N
So, when I look at reform anI look at the ``improvements'' that coulbe made, I see that we have yet to make the investment in Amtrak.	N
Investments have not really been sufficient to get a first class railroain our country, anwe fail to do that at our peril.	N
No one ever believethat woulbe possible, but it was that day anAmtrak was the only way to carry people from Washington.	N
The train brought up several Congressmen anSenators from Washington to New York to see what hahappenethat tragic day when New Jersey lost some 700 people anNew York almost 2,000.	N
It was a change in America, one that we never dreamewoulhappen, but has left a nightmarish impact on us ever since then.	N
Anso, I question whether or not the Amtrak Reform Boaris there to see that Amtrak ``improves'' its service to the country or whether or not it is there to further whittle away at Amtrak's ability to operate.	N
You know we have capital expenses, we have debt service, we have operating expenses, all of those things, anso, whatever one we choke off, coulagain be the death knell for Amtrak.	N
We know that there is an attitude, a preponderant attitude I'say within the Administration, that Amtrak is not a necessary part of our transportation system.	N
So once again, I hope that you haa chance, as I encouragethe other day, to look at the numbers ansee what they represent.	N
Mr. Chairman, if Amtrak didn't operate, just in the corridor, the northeast corridor, we'neemore than 10,000 flights a year to substitute for the passenger trafficking that Amtrak presently covers aneveryone knows that there's not a better expert in the Senate on aviation than Senator Stevens.	N
I have a nexus in aviation personnel as well anwe're going to be looking at the introduction of some 5,000 very light jets in the next 10 years.	N
The sky is infinite anas a consequence, we have to deal with it the best way we can, including a strong Amtrak.	N
Turning to Mr. Steinberg, the FAA announceon Monday that it's going to unilaterally impose a new contract on some 15,000 air traffic controllers.	N
This contract covers a wide range of unresolvebargaining issues anin court you arguethat the FAA coulimpose new conditions regarding pay anbenefits, but not terms about working conditions.	N
Now was it your advice to FAA that Federal law allows FAA to impose this change in working conditions as well?	N
So you think that the court gave you that latitude to make the decision that went beyonpay anbenefits in its interpretation of laws going back to 1996, diyou say?	N
But, Mr. Steinberg, in all fairness, here, you are an attorney, a skilleattorney, but I don't think it reflects well upon you to make an argument in court--	D
It was an appeals court that decidethis anthey rulein your favor after listening to your arguments.	N
So if there's an interpretation that you think can go beyonthe pay anbenefits issue, then I think it constitutes an interpretation that's unnecessarily broad.	N
Your action in this air traffic controller case createa lot of unnecessary work for the Congress.	N
Just so we can plan ahead, are there any other laws that you anticipate re-interpreting if you're confirmefor this position?	N
But you didn't accept the plain language of the law requiring submission to include the union's objections anreasons for the objections.	N
I like your commitment that you review this situation with us directly if confirmed, I'appreciate that.	N
OK, Mr. Hill, Secretary Mineta saithat he'be amenable to the increaseuse of triple trailer trucks.	N
Now, that's something that's of grave concern to me because of the known safety risks with these trucks.	N
I don't know whether you'like to have your family riding in front of, along side of, or behinone of those triple trailer trucks on our roads, but I woulsay this, I've fought very harto limit triple-truck use to 16 states, where it now is possible, there are all kinds of films anevidence that suggest that triple-trailer trucks present a heightenesafety risk ancan cause significant damage on roads not specifically prepareto handle them.	N
You haa direct role in developing the hours of service regulations that were overturneby the UniteStates Court of Appeals in 2004.	N
Even though the court requirethe FMC to re-examine anoverhaul the regulation, I'm concernethat the rule that was adoptein 2005 was almost functionally identical as the original rule anjeopardizethe safety of truck drivers anall motorists on the highways.	N
Yes, we've hasome terrible, terrible truck accidents as a result of sleepy drivers anI was thinking, Mr. Chairman, that they have a deadman's throttle in trains, but at least you know if the train continues, that it's going to be exactly where it's supposeto be.	N
Can we somehow or other, get some instrumentation in the cab that woulalert the driver or alert some recipient of the fact that this driver is beyonbeing able to function properly?	N
I saithat this woulbe the last question, but I meant that it was next to the last, Mr. Chairman.	N
I'm concernethat under this Administration, the agency FMC has not been effective enough when it comes to improving truck safety anif confirmed, what steps might you take to reduce the over 5,000 large truck-relatedeaths each year?	N
Senators Allen anWarner anCongressman Davis are here to introduce Sean Connaughton anCharles Nottingham.	N
I have been notifiethat many nominees have their family anfriends here today, anI hope the nominees will take the time to introduce them.	N
When I was on this committee we useto use a natural voice, but now we have all kinds of things.	N
Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment for a brief moment to welcome Senator Warner of course, all of the colleagues who will come.	N
I intento support all of these nominees anthank them to be willing to serve their country.	N
I dinot want to miss the moment, however, for the nominee to be Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board.	N
We have as you know, Mr. Chairman, we have for a long, long while have been suffering through these issues of rail rates in this country.	N
We desperately neean aggressive Surface Transportation Boarthat will stanup for shippers ando the right thing.	N
I hope that he anI will engage often ansee if we can get the Surface Transportation Boarstanup for the consumers anthe rail shippers of this country.	D
But again, I will support all of these nominees, anI think the Administration has given us some goofolks to consider for these important decisions.	N
I know you are to support a nominee, but we will proceewith him if that is all right with you?	N
I am currently chairing the ArmeServices Committee, anwe have a hearing with General Conway before us to be the next Commandant of the Marine Corps.	N
I think one of the fastest growing counties in America, not just the UniteStates, but America.	N
I have workewith him through the years, anhe will do an excellent job as a public servant, both of these men.	D
So with that, Mr. Chairman, anI ask indulgence to my goofriends who I've come to speak for, actually it is better that I say less, anyou say more.	N
I am especially pleaseto introduce to the Committee, Mr. Robert Sumwalt of Columbia, South Carolina, as a nominee to serve on the National Transportation Safety Board.	N
I also, I think Mr. Chairman, you have already recognizeRobert's wife, Anne, his daughter, Mackenzie, who are here to support his nomination today.	N
When you meet Robert the first thing that comes through is his passion for transportation safety.	D
I am here to speak on behalf of anintroduce Admiral Jay Cohen, the President's nominee to be Under Secretary of HomelanSecurity for Science anTechnology.	N
Admiral Cohen graduatefrom the Naval Academy anreceivea Master's degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.	D
He is a 35-year veteran of the Navy, most recently serving as the Chief of Naval Research.	D
In that role, he has championemany significant programs for the Marines anthe Navy, including some that I have been personally involvein anwatchehim professionally undertake.	D
I got to know the Admiral through two important projects that we have workeon together over the years.	N
One is callethe Magdalena Ridge Observatory, kinof a ``break the mold'' observatory approach on the top of a mountain with a different structure for observatories.	N
The Expeditionary Unit Water Purification Program has hamuch success in the past few years.	N
Mr. Chairman anmembers of the Committee, I am pleaseto join Senator Domenici in introducing Admiral Jay Cohen.	N
He has an extraordinarily distinguishecareer in the UniteStates Navy, anlet me emphasize as Senator Domenici did, his service of 5\1/2\ years as the Chief of Naval Research.	D
There he was responsible aneffective in managing complicatetechnology projects, delivering new technology annew innovation to the fleet anwith those skills, he will be superbly prepareto assume his new responsibilities in the Department of HomelanSecurity.	D
He also understands very well the neeto develop anmaintain an industrial base that will support the technology efforts of the Department, anthat industrial base is not just the facilities, but also the designers anthe engineers that are so critical to maintaining our progress ancontinuing our leadership in so many different roles.	D
As Senator Domenici pointeout, Admiral Cohen is a graduate of the Naval Academy, anI was reluctant to come here today until he informeme that the Navy football team lost all 4 years while he was at Navy.	D
Congressman Davis has workeat the local government level anhas workewith both of these gentlemen.	D
Particularly, understanding Sean Connaughton's work, anI thank Congressman Davis for coming over here for them.	D
The thirone by the way, Robert Sumwalt, I've actually hathe pleasure of meeting him with Senator DeMint, anI'm sure he'll extol his virtues, but I endorse his nomination as well.	D
As far as Sean Connaughton to be Administrator of the MARAD anChip Nottingham to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board, both of these are long time Virginians with an exceptional records of service to the people of the Commonwealth.	D
Sean Connaughton has done an absolutely superb job as Chairman of the Prince William Country Boarof Supervisors.	D
He has balancethe needs that the fighting andisputes that the country has over growth anwhere the growth shoulbe.	D
I was there about a month ago dedicating a 9/11 memorial for those who perisheon 9/11 from Prince William County, anwhat Sean has really shown is he is a man sticking to principles, well-	D
grounded, but also working with all parties to achieve positive goals for the people of a very diverse, large angrowing county.	D
In addition to that, being a graduate of not just of George Mason's law school, but a graduate of the U.S. Naval War College.	D
He's results-oriented, can-do, get things done, anSean Connaughton, I have no question in my minwoulbe exceptional in this position.	D
On Chip Nottingham, Chip servein Virginia, the Commonwealth Transportation Board, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Transportation, a tough, but a very important job.	D
He is also one who looks for innovative, creative ways of expanding the transportation pie.	D
One of the key Administration successes I hawhen I was Governor was what is callea Private Transportation Act, anChip Nottingham testeanexpandeanutilizethe approach, anI think that's the sort of creative leadership we neeat the national level, anChip Nottingham is a person again with a proven recorof performance, a person who has the right principles.	N
He solves problems anthat's the sort of person we neeon the Surface Transportation Board, anI recommenboth of these gentlemen with all my highest recommendations anlook forwarto their confirmation.	D
I'just like to say I am pleasethat the adopteson of Hawaii, Admiral Cohen, is one of the nominees, anI am certain that he will continue service to our Nation with great distinction.	N
I do, Chairman Stevens, anI am so pleaseto introduce my wife Nancy, her mother, Lee Noll, a WorlWar II Navy Nurse; anEleanor Rickover who we consider part of our family.	N
She is Admiral Rickover's widow, a career Navy Nurse, also Admiral Rickover who both of you, anmany on the Committee knew so well, taught us all to change the worlantaught us the value of standards.	N
in-law, Sarah anDon Clements, anthe future generation Hailey Clements anif we can get her to Hawaii, I think Senator she will compete very well for Miss Hawaii.	N
It certainly brings back memories for Senator Inouye anI anwe're particularly pleaseto see you here ladies, thank you for joining us.	N
You may not have been nominateto be Cabinet Secretaries yet, but you are all nominatefor very important assignments.	N
I am familiar with the backgrounof several of you, anI think you are really a well-qualifiegroup.	D
We dihave occasion to seek his assistance with some of our issues there along the Gulf Coast.	D
I am very concerneabout Maritime Administration anthe strength of our maritime industry.	N
I want to make sure the Administration understands anappreciates the neefor the Jones Act, anso I'm counting on you Mr. Connaughton, to work with us to make sure we do the right thing for the maritime industry.	N
Analso, Mr. Nottingham, let me just say that I have a lot of interest in surface transportation anrailroads.	N
We have an opportunity here to improve service, expancapacity, better serve the economy, anprepare for the future.	N
I certainly will support your nominations anI hope we can move them before the August recess.	N
One was an airplane that I barely missegetting on anit crashed, anwith many of my friends on boaranI was briefeon what happeneto that airplane.	N
The seconwas when I survivethe crash anfive people including my wife were killeanthey came antolme what hahappened.	N
Anthe thirwas when the Alaska Airlines coming out of Mexico went into an invertespin ancrashecarrying a whole series of people that I hagrown up with.	N
Your Boarhas more contact I think with the people than you realize, anwe all when we are exposeto circumstances like that want to know what happened.	N
I'm sure you know that the recent reduction in our accident rate in Alaska has been dramatic; brought about by the Medallion program anthe programs that we put into effect to have continuing education for pilots anto continue the utilization of new technology.	N
Admiral Cohen, I am certainly aware that the Congress has been a bit disappointewith the performance of the Science anTechnology directorate.	N
Well, Co-Chairman Inouye, I know your personal interest in science antechnology as an incubator of innovation anhow important that is, not only for Hawaii, but also for the free world.	N
I have haa chance to review the Fiscal Year 2007 Senate appropriations language which is very stern anvery direct.	N
I coulprobably take the rest of your afternoon here describing what needs to be done, but I am not yet associatewith the Department of HomelanSecurity.	N
All I can say to you sir, is that over the five plus years that I was at the Office of Naval Research, I encounteremany of the same kinds of problems even though Office of Naval Research was very mature ana very effective organization, it was not customer or output-oriented.	N
It was more provider aninput-orienteanin today's world, time to market, time to delivery, customer focus for the front line whether they're local, state, tribal, or first responders under the auspices of the Department of HomelanSecurity, they must have near-term enhancements as well as long-term leap aheaimprovements ancapability.	N
Anso, if confirmed, I will bring the same management approach anleadership approach anhands-on personal involvement that you saw at the Office of Naval Research to get our budget process right, get our requirements process right, get our balance between long-term research annear-term enhancements andeliverables right with full disclosure to the Congress.	N
Anit's a big job, anSenator I know frequently you hear that when individuals leave government, they say its to spenmore time with their family, but my lovely wife, Nancy, remindeme that coming back in the government, it was to spenless time with my family, anso it's a great challenge anI look forwarto it sir, if confirmed.	N
In your testimony you mentionethat you hope to bring the U.S. flag fleet back to the predominant role it once had.	N
As a member of an islanstate, I am naturally concerneabout the mission of NOAA, anI concur fully with Chairman Stevens' view on NOAA.	N
I wish to commenall of you for coming forwarto serve our Nation, anI can assure you that this committee will help you in your work.	N
I have one question, anthat is of Mr. Nottingham anI have some other questions, but I will forwarthem along later.	N
Previous nominees, Mr. Nottingham, have sat right in that same chair that you're sitting in right now anpromisethis committee they'get the small rate case procedure in place on the Surface Transportation Boaranit has yet to come.	N
They made those commitments about transparency animproveprocedures, enhancecompetition ana whole host of promises.	N
Well I thank you anI thank you for meeting with some of the people of my constituents anI woulappreciate that.	N
That's the only question I have as time is of the essence, anI have another--but I too want to echo the words of my goofrienfrom Hawaii.	N
It is great that we still have people that put the Nation's interest anthe citizens of the UniteStates before themselves anserve this great country with great talent anintelligence anwith great integrity, anso we appreciate every one of you stepping forwarandoing that.	D
Let me tell all of you nominees that there have been questions filefrom both sides of the aisle which we woulask you to responto.	N
If we can get the responses quickly, we will try to have the meeting off the floor of our committee sometime early next week, so we can get these nominations up anconfirmed.	N
We have to report them first so they go on the calendar anthen they are subject to review by all of the Members of the Senate, but we will do our best to get them clearebefore the enof next week when we expect to recess for our August period.	N
We remember so well meeting with your husbanso often, the Admiral, anhow gracious he was anhow much he contributeto the future of our Navy, so we thank you for taking the time to come with Admiral Cohen.	N
Anshe comes highly recommended, with your endorsement, so we will be pleaseto act on this nomination as quickly as possible.	D
Senator DaviPryor anChris Boskin have been nominateto serve on the Boarof Directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.	N
Although CPB does not produce programs, it awards grants to create public broadcasting programs.	N
As members of the Boarof Directors, these nominees woulset policies anestablish programming priorities.	D
AnMs. Boskin is one of the two nominees today that I think the Committee will be looking at.	N
I woulask consent that my full statement be made a part of the record, anI will be brief.	N
I'm delighteto recommenCharles Snelling for the position on the Boarof Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.	N
I've known Charlie Snelling for 25 years, anhe has been an enormous success in business.	D
President Ford, in 1976, appointehim to the President's Commission on Personnel Interchange.	N
He coulhandle matters of much greater magnitude, but I'm glahe's willing to accept this appointment.	D
He's done outstanding community work, anI know that haSenator Santorum been here to recommendehim, he wouljoin me in my praise.	D
Anwe will proceewith the hearing, then, with Dr. Sharon Hays, who was introduceby Congressman Ehlers.	N
Senator Rockefeller wantevery much to be here at this hearing, but, as you know, he's Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, anhe hato excuse himself.	N
However, he has askeme to submit his letter to the Committee with his, as I quote, ``unequivocal support'' of Senator Pryor's nomination.	N
I'like to commenancongratulate anthank Senator Pryor for his many, many years of public service--Congressman, Senator, Ambassador, annow Director.	D
And, with that, I'like to yielthe rest of my time to him, because he tolme he's got a whole lot of questions.	N
Mr. Chairman, I think every son looks forwarto the moment when they can finally get their father under oath.	N
Anthe irony of this does not escape my brother anI, because we remember our father, several times when during our teenage years, woultell us to turn the radio down.	N
And--now, Mr. Chairman, of course, I think that DaviPryor will do a fantastic job on the corporation board.	D
And, as I mentioneyesterday, I'll recuse myself from the vote, but I'm very, very appreciative for you moving this nomination anhaving the hearing today.	N
I am going to excerpt from the memos we hapreparebefore the hearing, a paragraph for each nominee today, anput that aheaof the statements that you are making.	N
I think you're all very excellently qualifiefor the position in which you've agreeto serve.	D
As two Senators who really have haa great interest in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I can assure you we'll maintain that interest.	N
Anwe have hasimilar feelings about the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs anthe directorship of the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
So, we'll be pleaseto try anmove these nominations as quickly as possible, anwe thank you all for coming.	N
Anwe'll turn to the next panel, if that's all right, unless any of you wanteto cross-examine us.	N
We have before us Colonel Calvin Scovel, of Virginia, to be Inspector General of the Department of Transportation; the Honorable Charles Snelling, of Pennsylvania, to be a Member of the Boarof Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority; anMr. Collister ``Terry'' Johnson, to be Administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.	N
I'like to congratulate all of you on your nominations ancommenyou anthank you for your public service.	D
Anunless there's an objection, anI don't expect one, we will prepare all seven of these nominations ando our best to clear them for reporting to the floor after the first vote that occurs following this hearing, unless there is a question that's raiseby any absent member, in which case that question woulhave to be respondeto by the nominee before we coulgo through that procedure, because it does take unanimous consent.	N
But we hope we'll be able to clear these for reporting to the floor sometime next Tuesday, at the latest, anthey will be, hopefully, considereby the Senate before we recess for the election period.	N
The General Counsel of the Department will play a key role of guiding the agency through the many challenges ahead.	N
Our Nation's transportation system is slowly collapsing under the tremendous stress of increasecongestion causeby growing passenger anfreight demand, anyears of underinvestment.	N
Tackling these problems will force us to face complex fiscal, environmental safety ansecurity issues requiring extraordinary leadership.	N
America's economic vitality, global competitiveness, anmost importantly, our quality of life, depenon our creating a safe anefficient transportation system.	N
Today we'll hear about Mr. Gribbin's qualifications to serve in this important position, anhis general outlook with regarto transportation policy, as well as his views on the privatization of public transportation infrastructure.	D
AnI don't want Mr. Gribbin or his family to think that because the hall is not filled, that it's not a matter of great interest.	N
And, I look at this from several standpoints, ancommenyou for wanting to take on this task.	N
As you can imagine--anas you'll finout if everything goes as you'like it to--that it is a tough job, but, a critically important one.	N
Anwhen you think of our transportation network, I don't think there has been enough made of the calculation concerning our national security.	N
Our transportation network, Mr. Chairman, is a critical element in our country's security: we may call on it for evacuation of people in an emergency, or to move goods anmaterials that are critical to preventing any attacks.	N
Heaven forbiif one does occur, our transportation system is vital, in terms of being able to responpositively.	N
Now, the Senate must perform its due diligence in assessing anconfirming nominees that are put forth by the Bush Administration.	N
And, once again, as I see your family, obviously there's a lot of goocharacteristics in that group.	N
I have never seen such a well-behavegroup of youngsters in my life, anI'm an expert, because I've got 10 grandchildren an4 kids of my own.	N
So I know it's not easy, especially in something as exciting as this must be to your littlest one.	N
Our country deserves nominees that are qualified, who will carry out their duties provideby law, annot simply blindly follow orders from the White House.	N
to also include your conscience to make sure that the target is a well-functioning transportation system.	N
Recently, President Bush haappointea nominee to the Boarof Amtrak who hanever ridden the train before.	N
I askehim a question at his Committee hearing about that, anhe saihe hajust not done it.	N
Anthat, to me, raisea serious question of judgment--or curiosity--about why the Bush Administration woulpropose such a person for the job on the Boarof Directors.	N
Now, we've not haa chance to meet, Mr. Gribbin, but I look forwarto doing so, so we can discuss things together.	N
But, I want to say to you at the outset--I'm concerneabout some of the things that you've advocatein the past, especially with respect to privatizing assets owneby the government.	N
Now, we've fought this battle before on Amtrak, anI reminyou that Amtrak was a composition of private passenger railroalines that hato be brought together under government auspices.	N
Our screeners at the airports were employeby private companies--the airlines--anthings dinot get done well.	N
Now, I come out of the corporate world, Mr. Gribbin, anI ran a large ansuccessful company that I helpestart.	N
And, so I know--having haexperience in both areas, government anbusiness--that government employees are equally as committed--	D
Because it's not just for profit, it's for some element of soul, some element of responsibility, love of country.	N
So, I woulsay that my view is that appointees, significant office holders, have to express themselves in a way that gets past pre-conceiveideas anlooks at the situation as it currently is.	N
So, I look forwarto having some of my questions answered, Mr. Chairman, anI thank you for moving this nomination forward.	N
Obviously, Mr. Gribbin is a man of some considerable talent, but I want to discuss his views on privatization in particular.	N
I woulask, if it's all right with you, Mr. Chairman, whether or not we can hear this statement as Mr. Gribbin has prepared.	N
When it's not trying to shut down Amtrak altogether, the Bush Administration has been advocating privatizing our Nation's passenger railroasystem.	N
Now, how are you going to deal with the movement within the Administration to privatize or outsource Amtrak's functions?	N
But, she'll come to you for guidance, you will also, not only be a policymaker, you'll also be a, an auditor as--I'm not using the term in the formal sense--but you'll also be looking at ways that you might think coulimprove the operations of Amtrak.	N
And, the Administration has not been shy at all about suggesting, through funding, that Amtrak coulbe shut down.	N
Now, in each case over the last couple years, it's been the Congress--the Senate, anthe House--restoring the funding for Amtrak's operations.	N
In the preparation for the budget this year, the amounts allocatethrough the Budget Committee anin the budget resolution are substantially higher, maybe by twice, than that which comes down from the Bush Administration.	N
So, one of the things that concerns me is the idealogy that if we can sheourselves of the ownership of Amtrak, we can also sheourselves of the responsibility of funding it.	D
You've hathis experience working in the private sector with a company that is one of the largest operators of toll roads.	D
Unless the borrowing is supporteby the full faith ancredit of the entity, being the state or county or the Federal Government.	N
And, are those conditions particularly notein the agreement with the private contractors that the state--most of these are state-owneroads, I assume--do they ask, or must they in order to borrow in the marketplace at the best rates, do they ask for the support of the state government, in terms of the issuance of these bonds?	N
Why do we see the borrowing process easier in the private sector than in the public sector?	N
What happens to the--your experience has been fairly limiteto highway issues, but the future transportation needs of our country can not be met by cars anairplanes alone.	D
Now, if confirmed, how woulyou ensure that we have a balancetransportation system, with rail travel options for both travelers anfreight shippers?	N
Well, the experience that you describeabout going up to New York is interesting, because I do it on a regular basis.	N
I go up to either Newark airport or LaGuardia airport because I live in New Jersey, mid-way between the two airports.	N
And, what I finis that I'll get on a flight, as I dilast Friday night--a week ago, Mr. Chairman--for a 5 o'clock flight.	N
And, the 5 o'clock flight left the grounat 7:15 p.m., angot to New York--after circling awhile--at 8:15 p.m., anthen we founthat there were no gates ready for us, so that took another 10 minutes.	N
Anthere's going to be a whole series of new airplanes, they're being introduced, the very light jets.	N
Anso, we now see these late flights--one out of four flights across America; even more out of Newark are delayed--but across America, the delays are still enormous.	N
And, so, anif we talk about an alternative that suggests that maybe Amtrak coulhelp relieve the congestion, if we then want to put it in the private marketplace where it, again, haits origination, I think that leaves us in a difficult position.	N
Now, your employer, Macquarie, purchasethe Virginia Dulles Greenway from a Haliburton subsidiary that hadefaulteon its debt payments.	N
Now it's clear that the Haliburton subsidiary casheout, now Macquarie is looking to raise tolls on Northern Virginia drivers.	N
Do you see a role for rail in dealing with emergencies like 9/11 or natural disasters like hurricanes?	N
You know, Mr. Chairman, there were a couple of major nuclear generating/energy generating plants that were abandoneafter the facility was built, anbuilt meaning having investebillions of dollars.	N
They were abandonebecause there was no satisfactory evacuation process or design to get people away if there was a problem in the nuclear plant.	N
So, do you see a role for dealing with emergencies like 9/11, natural disasters like hurricanes, or those accidents?	N
Or breakdowns in the system, as a result of insufficient access to modes of transportation, like rail?	N
OK, so do you see any inconsistency between your call, call for privatization anthe reliability of having facilities available for emergencies?	N
Is that portion of the system a candidate for privatizing, with all of the infrastructure improvement that has to be made there?	N
And, Mr. Chairman, the one thing that I think we have to make certain of, is that, talks about privatization shoultake place before there's any precipitous action--or any action--	N
because it's going to run afoul, many thoughts about privatizing something as essential as rail systems, that have their peculiarity of making money, or at least having decent revenues when the work hours are there, but otherwise having to make up for a lot of deatime anidle equipment.	N
I have the honor today, Mr. Chairman, to introduce to the Committee Mr. Charles Snelling for reappointment to the Boarof Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.	N
I've known Mr. Snelling for more than two decades, ancan personally attest to his integrity, his ability, anhis public service.	D
Of direct relevance to serving on the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is his extensive experience in the fielof aviation.	D
He has serveon the boarof directors for the Authority since 2003, when he was originally nominateby President Bush anconfirmeby the Senate.	D
He was appointed, in 2000, by Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge, to be a member anchair of the Pennsylvania Advisory Committee.	D
He haserveas the--on the boarof directors of the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority, which operates the Lehigh Valley International Airport.	D
He is President anDirector of the Snelling Company anWestern Lehigh Valley Corporation, a trustee of the Northeast Pennsylvania Management Trust, ana director of the Wiley Technologies, former president of the City Council of Allentown, serveas trustee on the Lehigh Valley Hospital Health Network, 5 years in that capacity.	D
Anit is always harto see what happens there, but there was a hold, anwe don't know exactly why.	N
Anit's my hope that we'll be able to move his nomination through the Committee, anmove it through the floor, so that he can take his position on this Authority, where I think he can perform very, very valuable public service.	D
I woulhave been here earlier, but we are struggling to get a quorum in the Judiciary Committee, where, as the Chairman knows, I am ranking member.	N
If you'll just wait a few seconds, the recorwill show that no one has voicean objection to the nomination of Mr. Snelling.	N
Anso, without objection, the nomination is approved, anit will be reporteto the Senate forthwith.	N
AnI'm here for the great pleasure anhonor to introduce to the Committee a fellow Floridian, a fellow who has devotea great deal of time to serving the people of my state.	D
Denver Stutler is currently the President of Stutler Strategies, Incorporated, ana Founding Member of Perkins Bay, a real estate consulting firm in Tampa.	N
The Florida Secretary of Transportation, as my colleague from Florida well knows, is a very important anresponsible job, anMr. Stutler diit with--of course, I shoulsay, Secretary Stutler--diit with great distinction.	N
And, being from the State of Florida, I was the HUD Secretary, anwe workeon a number of issues relating to our state as our responsibilities intersected.	N
Before that time, he was Chief of Staff to former Governor Jeb Bush, and, I know, in both of these public roles he made many positive contributions to improving Florida's transportation infrastructure aneconomic development.	D
Prior to serving Governor Bush, Mr. Stutler serveas the Senior Fellow for U.S. Senator Connie Mack, where he advisethe Senator on environmental anwater-relateappropriations anpolicy.	D
Denver earnehis bachelor's degree in engineering, anmaster's degree in civil engineering, from the University of Central Florida, anhas since demonstratean outstanding commitment to public service.	D
It's because of this recorof dedication that I believe Denver Stutler is fully qualifieto serve on the Amtrak Reform Board, anit is my hope that he will continue to ensure the availability of safe anreliable transportation service for all Americans.	D
Mr. Chairman, as you know, Senator Martinez anI have an excellent professional relationship, as well as a personal relationship that goes back 30 years.	D
Chairman, I think, without exception, on all of the appointments that we have a chance to recommend, Senator Martinez anI have been joineat the hip in being unanimous about the particular nominees, particularly if they affect Florida.	N
And, in this particular case, of Mr. Stutler to be on the Amtrak Board, we, likewise, are unanimous in our opinion that he shoulbe appointeto the Amtrak Board, for all of the reasons that Senator Martinez has just stated.	N
Each of the nominees before us are slateto fill important posts critical to the future of America's transportation system.	N
From ensuring the safety of the country's pipelines to overseeing the management of the Nation's passenger railroad, the work you will perform at each of your respective agencies shoulbe confirmed--shoulyou be confirmed, will help ensure that America's transportation system remains a global leader which supports our vibrant economy angreat tradition of efficient travel anmobility.	N
The Administrator of the Pipeline anHazardous Materials Safety Administration must continue to chart a course for the Department of Transportation's newest safety agency that will improve the safety ansecurity of our pipeline anhazardous materials transportation systems.	N
Several recent pipeline accidents have highlightethe importance of this task, anwe are looking for strong leadership at this agency, as well as a commitment to implement, fully, the important safety provisions enacteinto law by this Committee in the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, anSafety Act of 2006.	N
Amtrak BoarMembers must continue the progress made over the last several years towaran efficient aneffective national passenger railroad, while working with the Congress to reauthorize Amtrak, gain stable anadequate funding, anpromote new investments that can unlock the promise of rail service in new corridors.	N
Members of the Surface Transportation Boarmust balance the growing neefor new anexpandecapital investment in the freight rail industry against the equal--the legitimate goal of ensuring reasonable anfair prices anservices for railroacustomers.	N
Ato each of these individual challenges the government-wide budget constraints brought on by historic deficits ancontinuedemands to improve safety anmobility, your work is truly cut out for you.	N
I look forwarto hearing your perspectives today as we examine your credentials anviews.	N
We have hearnothing negative about his nomination, and, unless there is an objection, it is my plan to consider his nomination at an executive session, along with the other nominees on the panel.	N
As many of you know, Alaska is the home of the one of the largest pipeline systems in the world, one which has transporteover 15 billion barrels of oil since its inception in 1977.	N
The Pipeline anHazardous Materials Safety Administration plays a critical role in maintaining this pipeline anensuring the safe transportation of oil another hazardous goods all over the country.	N
This morning I am pleaseto see Carl Johnson here as the nominee for Administrator of this important agency.	N
Before retiring in April, Mr. Johnson spent 19 years serving as President of the CompresseGas Association, where he developean extensive understanding of the transportation of hazardous materials.	D
During his tenure, Mr. Johnson was dedicateto decreasing the risks associatewith industrial anmedical gases through the development of consensus standards, anhe was instrumental in a push to harmonize these another safety standards on a global scale.	D
Before joining the CompresseGas Association, Mr. Johnson workeat Corning Glass Works for 24 years, where he was the Director of Federal Government Relations.	D
It was there that he met my goofrienancolleague, former Representative Amory Houghton, who brought Mr. Johnson to the Hill in 1987, following his election to the House of Representatives.	D
While working in the House, Mr. Johnson was responsible for leading the Congressman's work on the Government Operations Committee anhaa hanin several key issues in the District.	D
This Committee enjoyean excellent working relationship with Admiral Barrett, the original Administrator of PHMSA, anI look forwarto continuing such a relationship with his successor.	D
His wife, Gail, with whom a number of us met yesterday, was stricken, I think, en route to the hearing today, anhas been hospitalized, I think, at GW, with a stroke of some kind, or a seizure, which is a matter of great concern.	N
I've just callehim on the phone to try to reach him, anwas unable to reach him, but our thoughts anprayers are with her, ancertainly with him.	N
I've known him for the better part of a dozen years, ansort of--together, because our names are similar.	D
It's harto imagine that there are two Tom Carpers, but actually there's a third, who was poet laureate of Maine at one time.	D
But I knew Mayor Carper when he became a Member of the Amtrak Boarof Mayors Advisory Council, I think, in about 1991, about 15 years ago, anactually serveas his Chairman from 2000 to 2001, while he was still Mayor of Macomb.	D
I believe we're fortunate to have our other two nominees before us today for the Amtrak Board.	N
We've passed, with the guidance of our leadership here on this Committee, major energy legislation that the President appears ready to sign, anthat'll be a goothing for our country as we seek to reduce our reliance on foreign oil anto reduce the emission of harmful substances into the air.	N
I remember being regaleby stories by my aunts anuncles of train rides from coast to coast to be marrieduring the middle of WorlWar II, anjust--at a time when we hatroop trains going all over the country, anhano interstate railroad, ancommercial aviation was still in its infancy.	N
I actually think maybe some of the best days, some of the most important days for passenger rail in this country lie ahead, as we do seek to reduce our reliance on foreign oil.	N
A lot of other countries share that goal with us, ana lot of them funtheir intercity passenger rail systems, support them more robustly than we do at both the operating anthe capital level.	N
But they do so for selfish reasons, anwe should, as well; anamong those selfish reasons are to, as I saiearlier, reduce reliance on foreign oil; second, to reduce the kinof congestions we face on our highways today.	N
Coming down on--I actually take the train, many days, to Washington, but I can actually look out my window of the train, as we zippealong at 125 miles an hour, ansee cars antrucks barely moving on the highways alongside of us.	N
So, we neeto reduce our reliance--we neeto reduce our congestions on our roads, anour airports.	N
My wife just flew out to the Appalachian State/Delaware football game out at--in Chattanooga last weekend, anshe hasome great stories to tell me about trying to get there by air.	N
Anso, all--I think all of us have haa bite out of that apple, anwe know what challenges it poses for us.	N
We breathe air that is not healthy, not goofor us, not goofor our children, not goofor our grandparents, our parents, anwe neeto do something about it.	N
Anit's not a silver bullet, but it's a speedier train than it useto be, anit's part of the solution to those two challenges that we face.	N
I'm anxious to hear their goals anthe plan--antheir plans for this--these very important positions.	N
I'm going to be focusing on their views of the abandonment process, of balancing interests between shippers anrailroads.	N
These are legitimate sources of capital, but I am concerneabout short-term investor goals trumping long-term interests of our commerce in this country.	N
AnI'm very anxious to know what they believe the STB's role is in ensuring that investments are made to maintain this basic infrastructure, because I'm afraithat that is being shortchanged, anI'm very anxious to see a much more vigorous role so that people in rural areas who have raw materials anproducts to get to market can get them there, anthat they're not helhostage, as is happening in too many places in this country.	N
I now woullike to call upon the Administrator-designate of the Pipeline anHazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Mr. Carl T. Johnson.	N
designate Amtrak Boarof Directors, Mr. Denver Stutler; anMember, Surface Transportation Board, the Honorable Francis Mulvey.	N
Mr. Chairman, I welcome Mr. Johnson, because I think we probably have an example of aging pipelines in our state.	N
We are very conscious of the safety factors, anwe will look to him for guidance, anI hope that he will be able to suggest to Congress if there are any changes in existing law that shoulbe considerein order to assure the safety ansurvival of these pipeline systems.	N
I just want to run through a couple of comments that I haprepareand--just to highlight the neethat we have for infrastructure investment.	N
No matter where we look, we see crowding, we see delays, we see congestion, we see pollution.	N
Very frankly, I'm depending on the Amtrak Boarnominees to not just talk about the betterment of their financial condition, but the betterment of their operation.	N
What do we want from Amtrak, in terms of its--it being the thirleg--or passenger rail service--the thirleg in our transportation system?	N
When you look at highways, anif you look at the skyways, they are unable, with their present conditioning, to be able to accommodate America's needs.	N
AnI'point out--anI learned, just recently--or I looked, just recently--at the population growth in this country.	N
Airport runways, for instance, do not have the best technology on the runways to keep our passengers anflight crews safe.	N
Anso, as we struggle to meet travelers' demands--anI use Amtrak frequently, because I founout that a 45-minute flight from here to New York or Newark Airport--I live midway between the two, in New Jersey--anI finthat the 45-minute flight from here to New York region airports can take 2 or 3 hours--45-	N
And, oddly enough, my two colleagues who sit at the front of the desk, the Chairman anthe Vice Chairman, are the furthest from Amtrak that you coulbe anstill be in the UniteStates.	N
Well there is no link from Fairbanks to Canada; otherwise, we coulput rail cars through the Alaska railroad, the Canadian system, andown into Amtrak.	N
In any event, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask that my statement be--full statement be included----	N
Carper, I understand, couldn't be here, regrettably; I learnethat--the reason for his not being here--but each of you, as those who are Amtrak nominees, have each of you ridden recently on Amtrak?	N
I came down on the railroayesterday from Newark to Washington, anI was on the bumpy trains.	N
But it just--even as it makes progress, it's obvious that it hasn't kept up with the current need.	N
Anthe one thing I woulcaution those of you who are nominees, is, when you look at the reform, I have--you have to think deeply about what you mean by ``reform.''	N
A reform doesn't simply mean getting--looking just at the work rules or things of that nature, to--but what role the railroashoulplay in America's near future--not far-	N
AnI think that you have an obligation to try anmake sure that, whatever funding we can get for Amtrak, we must get.	N
And, Mr. Chairman, all of us here are now aware of the fact that we are having a particular funding mechanism go into play, omnibus funding for our needs, anwe've already been notifiethat this year's Amtrak expectation, not the new Amtrak reauthorization bill, but just the appropriations required, has been cut by $100 million.	N
Anthese things play a terrible role in making sure that Amtrak, that has never been sufficiently funded--if we'look at what's happenein Europe, Germany spent $7 billion a year, I think, for 10 years to get their system up to snuff.	N
And, since this has been a public corporation since the early 1970s, I don't think we've spent $30 million--$30 billion.	N
AnI woulcaution you about making certain that you stanup for more funding andon't simply defenan administration position on what they want to do.	N
I didn't see you making any--either of you making comments in the--in your statements about what the problems might be.	N
If we coulget Amtrak to accelerate its ride between here anNew York, I think that we coulrelieve the skyways of some of the pressure that we have, the shuttles that go back anforth.	N
Now, what experience diyou learn in that Administration that--because that project was killed.	N
Do you think that experience will help you, as a Member of the Boarof Amtrak, when you see projects that demana bolapproach in the--something that may be painful in developing, but on the--in the final analysis, will make our rail system a lot more efficient anbetter for us?	N
But I'like the recorto be kept open so we can submit written questions to our friends at the witness table.	N
If I could, I'like to yielto Senator Smith, then I'll, maybe, succeehim, if I could.	N
Do you neesome legislative authority, that we ought to be getting to you, to have the enforcement---- 	N
Well, I hope that if you find, as you proceeafter your confirmation--reconfirmation--that you neemore authority than you have, that you will come to this Committee, anwe will write you authority to make sure you have the tools necessary to serve the public.	N
Do you believe that the abandonment process effectively balances the interests of shippers anrailroads?	N
I just want to register my concern--my question, really--that perhaps the abandonment process does not adequately balance the interests of involveshippers anrailroads.	N
Well, to that very issue, Commissioner, earlier this fall the short-line railroathat provideservice along a 136-mile stretch in southwest Oregon announceit woulsuspenservice, due to safety concerns involving the line's tunnels.	N
The Federal RailroaAdministration engineers have tourethe line anconfirmethat it is a safety hazard.	N
``predominant problems observewere decay of untreatecinder timbers, lagging anfooting blocks.''	N
The FRA's inspectors notethat ``some of the timbers sounhollow andecayewhen struck with a hammer.''	N
Now, clearly this situation dinot happen overnight, this has been going on, apparently, for a long, long time.	N
Anwhat I really want to know is what Surface Transportation Board's role is in ensuring that investments are made to provide proper maintenance so that we don't get into these situations anliterally strand--leave strandehundreds of family-supporting, goowage jobs that work in mills, that work in fish processing, that work in places that really have no other transportation alternative, because the winding roads to get to I-5 are simply already congested.	N
Who's responsible, anwho do we look to for an answer to--when we go back home anwe are confrontewith hundreds of people who are saying, ``Well, wait a minute, they didn't make the investment, anmy job is coming to a close because we can't ship what we produce here''?	N
Anplease don't regarthis as a criticism of you, Commissioner, that is not intendeso--but somebody's faileon the job, candidly.	N
But, you know, whether it's FRA or STB, we neesomebody that has some authority ansome accountability, anthis is an issue that really does impact, adversely, rural places.	N
Oregon anWashington are one of just a handful of states who meet their Amtrak copayment obligation.	N
I was very pleaseto help participate in passing the Amtrak reform bill that moves into a more fair allocation of cost-sharing with states fulfilling their responsibilities, too.	N
But when it comes to cost allocation ancapital match, I want to really highlight to you, the key is--	N
Anso, I wonder if any of you have a comment about the role you see for States in expanding passenger rail anensuring that the whole system remains viable.	N
Again, thanks to our witnesses for your presence anfor your willingness to serve our country.	D
First, Secretary Stutler, when you left my office yesterday, you were having real problems with your back, anI coultell you were in a lot of pain.	N
I don't know if you're in pain right now, but if it gets to be too painful, I'stanup, if I were you, anwe'll try not to make the pain any more painful than it needs to be.	N
The question I--one of the questions I askeour Amtrak nominees yesterday--anI just wanteto come back to it again today, to ask each of you just to share with us your vision for passenger rail service in the 21st century.	N
Let me ask--anthis woulbe a question for you, Secretary Stutler, anthen for Ms. Naples, as well.	N
When--putting on your olhat as the Secretary of Transportation for your state, how can we create a better partnership between the Federal Government--federally fundeAmtrak, working in concert with the states anworking in concert with the private freight railroads who own the track over which Amtrak needs to travel outside of the corridor?	N
We were talking, yesterday, about--anyou mentioneagain today in your testimony--that the ridership--you, sort of, wonderealouyesterday, anagain today, why the ridership on Amtrak is as low as it is.	N
Actually, in the Northeast Corridor you can't buy a train ticket for the next week or two, anit was that way arounThanksgiving.	N
When--the regionals do well, but not that well--but when you get outside the corridor anAmtrak doesn't own the track, as you know, they've got to get out of the way of the freights.	N
Anthe priority of the freight railroads, for the most part, is to move freight, not people.	N
But, just--my question is, how do we make it--if you--I think of it like--almost like three legs of a stool--Federal Government, through Amtrak, the State governments, anthe for-	N
profit freight railroads--how do we get them, better, to work together to provide the underpinning for passenger rail service that works outside of the corridor?	N
Anwe've seen some examples out of Chicago, in the Midwest ancertainly on the West Coast, that might provide some examples.	N
Mrs. Naples angentlemen, on behalf of the Committee, I'm pleaseto congratulate you on your nominations anto thank you for your public service.	N
We will be submitting questions for your consideration, anI hope you can responto them.	N
This afternoon, in mid-afternoon, we will have an executive session, at which time Mr. Johnson, Ms. Naples, Mr. Stutler, Dr. Mulvey, anMr. Carper will be confirmed.	N
I think these are two very important positions at the Department of Transportation, anI look forwarto the hearing today.	N
They might have a boat from time to time, but year-rountransportation is air transportation.	N
It is important that the FAA maintain knowledge of Alaska, anMr. Sturgell, I am a little concerneabout the retention of our people in the FAA in Alaska.	N
Anbecause of our unique terrain anthis enormous aviation community, it is essential that we have people up there who understanthe state anunderstanthe weather in the state.	N
So I look forwarto having the chance to discuss this with you, anI want to work with the Chairman anboth of you, when you are confirmed, antry to see if we can do our best to improve the aviation system of our country.	N
As a frequent flyer between California anWashington, as in well more than a million miles since I came to Congress, I know firsthanthe challenges the flying public faces when they travel.	N
The Department of Transportation confirmeon Tuesday what airline passengers have known all year, that 2007 was the second-worst year on recorfor airline delays.	N
I am very concerneabout the fact that the air traffic controllers in my state are telling me that FAA simply doesn't grasp the full implications of the increasing number of air traffic controller retirements across the Nation.	N
Controllers tell me that a wave of retirements, dispute over pay, controller fatigue, excessive overtime hours, training of new hires, anunsuitable working conditions in the towers are creating a safety hazaron the grounanin the air for the passengers.	N
This is very serious, I think, to all of us, anwe look forwarto hearing your response with your plans to deal with this.	N
The economic impact of delays in the aviation industry have a negative impact on our economy.	N
Data releasethis week, as Senator Boxer just noted, 2007 was one of the worst years for commercial flights in this country.	N
More bags were lost, anthere were more customer complaints than in 2006 anthe most since the year 2000.	N
That data alone is all we neeto move expeditiously on the FAA reauthorization bill stuck in the Senate.	N
I do not agree with the premise that we have to create a new bureaucratic system of fee collection to pay for the improvements to the air traffic control system.	N
I see no reason why we cannot use the current payment system of fuel anexcise taxes to funthe FAA.	N
The money needeto pay for the NextGen system can be collectethrough the current financing structure much more simply, much less expensively.	N
I am looking forwarto hearing Mr. Sturgell's explanation for why we cannot use the current system to pay for NextGen Air Transportation System.	N
I am not convincethe FAA has the capability to implement a system that requires the technological change currently proposed.	N
The FAA does not have the best track recorwhen it comes to implementing new technological systems.	N
I am also concerneabout the FAA's reliance on technology for the NextGen system that is not available anmay not be available when needed.	N
I have yet to hear when key system technological capabilities will be delivered, how much capacity will be addeto the system, anhow much of the olsystem will be retaineas a backup.	N
I am interestein learning what we can do to improve our Nation's airways between now anthen.	N
I am concernethat when we discuss NextGen, no one talks about the neefor more capacity on the ground.	N
But without places to lanangates to receive those planes, we will still have those same problems on the grounas in the sky.	N
It was aviation that enablea coast-to-coast development that made us the great Nation that we are today.	N
Anif these nominees are confirmed, their whole responsibility is to shape our Nation's transportation future on the rails, the highways, anin the sky, anthusly, we have createa critical obligation to be as thorough as we can in the selection of these government leaders.	N
I first want to apologize to Congressman LoBiondo for not having been here to welcome him.	N
AnI know that he came to introduce Simon Gros, who is nominateto be Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs for DOT.	N
I have workewith Mr. Gros since he has been with the Department of Transportation annotehis professionalism andiligence, anI believe the Committee shoulconfirm his nomination.	D
Anif I might take this opportunity to congratulate you on taking your 15,000th vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate?	N
There were distinguisheMembers of the Senate who tolthat for the truth yesterday, anthe remarks were very generous anwell deserved.	N
I want to congratulate the two nominees anto say that I reatheir testimony with interest.	N
I wish both of you well, anI will simply, by way of opening statement, express my hope that they will maintain an interest in the small communities of the UniteStates that serve rural America.	N
The FAA Contract Tower Program continues to be one of the most successful ancost-effective FAA-industry partnerships, as validatenumerous times by the Department of Transportation Inspector General.	N
There are seven FAA contract towers in my state of Mississippi alone, anthe bottom line is that without this program, many of these smaller airports woulnot be benefiting from the important safety benefits that control towers provide the flying public.	N
So I woulhope that, if confirmeby the Senate, Mr. Chairman, these two witnesses will continue to maintain as a top priority the 249 smaller airports in America that benefit from this program.	N
She is the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee for Aviation, anshe wants to have me voice her support for these two nominations anhope that we will have a chance for early confirmation.	N
I want to welcome our nominees this morning anappreciate your willingness to serve the country.	N
AnMr. Sturgell, I know I have hathe opportunity to visit with you a little bit about some of the airline issues that are important in my State.	N
But I wouljust, when we get into questions, be interestein hearing a little bit about your views on airline consolidation.	N
That is something that is of great interest to those of us who represent rural areas anwhat that might mean in terms of service ancost anwhat not for travelers in rural areas of the country.	N
Of course, last year everybody knows was second-worst ever on record, anthat is something that also I think all of us on the panel are very interestein anhope that you will tackle anattack.	N
AnI know in your capacity as the Acting Administrator, you have been focusing on that, anI woulencourage you to continue to do that anlook forwarto hearing your thoughts about how we might be able to improve even further on that.	N
I think the two of us, the Chairman anI, probably fly a greater distance on aircraft than any Senators in history.	N
I just want to reminthe Committee of one instance where I went to National, anwe hato wait 2 hours because the cabin crew was stuck in New York because of a storm.	N
We took off 2 hours late, went to the Midwest hub, anwe were first tolthere was a mechanical problem, but then they tolus the truth ansaiwe were waiting for pilots.	N
But I want you to know, I don't think it is the FAA's problem necessarily, but the FAA has neglecteto deal with the operators of these aircraft to work out a system where we are not delayebecause the crews aren't there.	N
AnI think one of your first jobs shoulbe to look into how to manage the airlines so there are people there to man them anfly them, anthey are fueleanwith fooonboarbefore they take off.	N
I really think that all of these delays are relateto the problem of allowing crews to live in one part of the country anfly into another.	N
If you don't examine it, I am going to ask the Chairman to examine it here with public hearings.	N
When the CAB was eliminatefrom the system anwe createthe FAA anwe hathe concept of really not the government no longer designing airline routes anwho flew where anhow often, one of the things that we startewas to automate a lot of the flight service stations arounthe country.	N
But there was an agreement made in my state, Alaska, that because of its size anthe dependence upon aviation, as I indicated, the flight service stations woulbe maintained.	N
Some time later, we were tolthat the contract to manage those flight service stations habeen workeout with Lockheed, anLockheetook over the management of them.	N
I met just last week with a group of those flight station operators who are slowly but surely leaving because of the changes in policy--I understanLockheewalkeaway from that, annow it is back with FAA.	N
One young woman tolme she was 4 days from her retirement, anshe was given a discharge.	N
Two others tolme that they hajust signeup for their extension of service, anthey were tolthey were going to be reassigneto another State.	N
Now, I don't think you have many flight service stations left in the rest of the UniteStates, do you?	N
But the numbers of the flight service operators are about 50 percent of what they were 3 years ago.	N
How woulyou like to lanin Sicily with someone sitting in Paris telling you what the quality of the runway was?	N
It is Italy, Germany, France, anSpain put together, anyou are trying to run it from Anchorage.	N
We eliminatedeaths in our aviation community with the cooperation of your predecessor, anI think we have the best flight safety concepts in the worlnow.	N
But the problems that are coming up now are because of the lack of information about the condition of the airports where these pilots are flying into anthe lack of information on the grounas to changes in conditions that have occurrewhile the plane has been in the air.	N
Because half of the flight service stations were closed, I am told, within the last 3 years.	N
You know there are three mountain ranges in Alaska, anif you flew out of Adak, you were in safe country compareto the north country.	N
I really want to work with you, but I met with a group of people, both in the industry, both operators anpersonnel in those flight service stations, anthey are an angry crew.	N
I want to talk with you, Mr. Sturgell, about the passenger bill of rights that Senator Snowe anI wrote anthe fact that you are coming out with proposerulemaking.	N
Why do you have a rule that does not--a proposerule that doesn't include minimum standards for airline contingency plans for food, water, ana timetable for passengers to deplane when they are strandeon the tarmac?	N
Well, let me just say because I don't--do you believe that the final rule will have minimum standards?	N
So that we know that our people aren't going to be starving, anif they are sitting on the tarmac for hours, that the toilets are going to be working?	N
The point of Senator Snowe's bill anmy bill is so that we, as America, say you can treat people, you must treat people with dignity anrespect anbe concerneabout their safety.	N
Will you have, I just want a yes or no, minimum standards in that rule for the airlines to follow?	N
Well, then Olympia Snowe anI are going to have to have a meeting with Secretary Peters about it.	N
GAO reportein December that at least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities were working 6-day weeks.	N
So you think 10 hours a day, 6 days a week is going to leaus to have safety in the skies.	N
I just--I feel it is important for my Chairman to hear certain things, anI just think what we have just heard, unless I was wrong, is that Mr. Sturgell believes that a 6-day week, 10 hours a day, is a fair work schedule for our controllers.	N
But my understanding is the GAO reporteat least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities were working that 6-day week as a regular schedule.	N
I might, if I was poor or haa problem or haa divorce anhato pay my wife or whatever my circumstances are, I might volunteer to work 12 hours a day.	N
I am asking you whether you think it works for safety in the skies to have 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities, including towers at major airports, working 6 days a week?	N
So am I to assume then that you are concernethat GAO reportethat at least 20 percent of controllers at 25 facilities are working 6 days a week, including towers at major airports?	N
The December 2007 GAO report mentionethe FAA may not be accurately reporting the number andetails of runway incursions.	N
Why dithe FAA not immediately investigate a possible runway incursion at San Diego airport 2 weeks ago?	N
But the GAO, I mean, this isn't me or Senator Stevens or Senator Inouye or Rockefeller or Hutchison, this is the GAO, December 2007, saiyou may not be accurately reporting the number andetails of runway incursions.	N
I hope that I can infer from that that it is an unacceptable situation, anyou are going to sit everybody down anget to the bottom of it.	N
Because, here, I woullike to put in the recoran article from the The San Diego Union-Tribune, January 26, the FAA blamea runway incursion on a control tower mistake.	N
But I will get this over to you, sir, anI woullike it if you coulplease get back to me on that.	N
Anduring that time, we hasome controversy over the granting--I'm sorry, the denial of the waiver to California.	N
Now, it has been reportethat you were involvein the lobbying campaign conducteby DOT officials last year in which you were contacting Governors anMembers of Congress, seeking to generate opposition to the California waiver request.	N
You have been quoteas saying that, within DOT, the people involvein the effort were Secretary Peters, yourself, anfive other DOT staffers, but you have been unclear about the involvement of others in the Executive Branch.	N
CEQ? EPA? Diyou ever talk to people in those agencies during the time you were lobbying Members of Congress anGovernors anothers?	N
Diyou ever have e-mail conversations with anyone in the President's office or the Vice President's office or at the CEQ?	N
The reason I raise it is that it is not appropriate, nor within the traditions of our government, for an agency to lobby another agency anto gin up Members of Congress.	N
So I am going to senyou a letter, just for you to put this in writing, anI do thank you very much for letting us know in the past what occurreat that time.	N
I regret that I didn't note before your incredible record, which I note with envy, of 15,000 votes, anI congratulate you for that.	N
Do you remember the experience of 2003 in terms of hiring, or how many people diyou hire in the year 2003?	N
We are often told, anI hamany discussions with Ms. Blakey about this, I woulcheck with the towers ansee what they have had.	N
So you have to make up for that in addition to being able to get the training that is necessary.	N
You make a blanket statement, if I understanyou correctly, that you are right on schedule, that all of the towers are populateby the trainecontrollers that they shoulhave, including the newer of those in training.	N
Have we--diwe anticipate the number of retirements accurately, do you think, over the last couple of years?	N
AnMr. Sturgell, even former Administrator Blakey admittethat her refusal to work with air traffic controllers annegotiate a new agreement on pay anworking conditions leto a mass exodus of controllers.	N
Are you listening to the employees at the bargaining table or to obtain a voluntary agreement with them?	N
Well, that says, no matter how carefully the words are planted, if you are working to improve it, it must have been deficient in the past.	N
In 2006, Lexington, Kentucky, the crash that took 49 lives, the pilots dinot have the most recent publisheinformation about runway layouts, which it saicontributeto the crash.	N
Anwhy dithe FAA change flight departure headings out of Newark airport before even publishing the new information?	N
Do they make changes without forewarning or providing the knowledge to pilots anthose interesteparties, controllers, et cetera, before they make changes?	N
But now we are talking about passenger aircraft, anwe are talking about the responsibility to make sure that they are----	N
Anwe are still waiting to see what kinof material is being given out so that, as far in advance as possible, the pilots are alerteto the changes that are being made.	N
AnMr. Sturgell, Mr. Gros, thank you again for your service, anI want to begin by saying that on behalf of our constituents, in most cases, want to make sure that Members of Congress can identify with their circumstances anfeel their pain, so to speak.	N
Anwhen it comes to airline service, that is one area where most of us, particularly those of us who travel back anforth on a regular basis, can relate anhave, on many occasions, sat in terminals anwith our constituents, many of whom expect us to be able to do something about their plight.	N
But I do want to say, anI think that it has already been emphasizehere with respect to the statistics last year anhow those square with history, that most of us, I think a lot of these things tento be weather-related.	N
Ancertainly nobody wants anybody to take any risks that wouljeopardize or put anybody in a situation that is unsafe, anthat is not controllable.	N
So, but the fact that these statistics continue to slip andeteriorate over time suggest that many of the factors adding to delays are factors that are controllable.	N
Ana 75 percent performance on-time arrival for any other industry, that is a D, if you were scoring it if you were a professor in college.	N
Anany other business that was only able to provide on-time service 75 percent of the time probably woulbe out of business.	N
AnI guess the thing that concerns me about the airline industry generally is there seems to be sort of an acceptance of mediocrity.	N
AnI think that these factors, anI will associate myself with the comments from the Senator from Alaska, when it comes to pilots not being available or those types of issues, those are issues that, in my view, are in most cases within the control of the airline.	N
AnI hope that the airlines, of course, who I am sure are listening, woultake note of the importance of improving on those statistics anhopefully restoring what I woulcall, I guess, a culture of excellence when it comes to the delivery of this very important service.	N
Anymore travel has become--when people ask me, always when you talk in front of a group, people ask you what is the best part anthe worst part about your job.	N
Anthat has, unfortunately, I think become the reality for way too many people in this country.	N
But given that fact, anI hope that this can be improveupon, but I also think it is important if that is going to be the state of play in the airline industry that consumers neeto know who is gooanwho is not, who is getting there on-	N
AnI introducea bill a while back that woulrequire a certain amount of reporting for those flights that are delayed, those flights that are chronically canceleon a flight-by-	N
AnI think it is important for consumers to know, so at least they can make informechoices.	N
When they go in, they are booking a flight, that is the type of data that needs to be available.	N
Now what the airlines will tell you, anthey are correct, is that that data is available.	N
But I think it needs to be available in a more usable form to people who are purchasing tickets.	N
Anso, I would--I am going to continue to work with the FAA reauthorization to see that we get some of those provisions put in that require the airlines to at least inform consumers so they can make choices about which flights on a consistent basis are being delayeor canceleanthose that aren't.	N
Because I think it woulgo a long ways towarhelping make the airlines a little bit more responsive as well.	N
But I do want to follow up with a question that I mentioneearlier, anthat has to do with this whole issue of airline consolidation.	N
Because I think that, anyou can argue, I am sure, both ways on this anI have heararguments that in my area of the country that we woulbenefit from having a consolidateairline that has perhaps economies of scale anis a stronger airline financially in terms of both routes anprices aneverything else.	N
The widely helview among consumers is that fewer airlines means less competition and, therefore, fewer options anperhaps higher prices.	N
Anso, there is a discussion about some mergers that woulaffect my State in particular ana lot of other states in my region of the country.	N
AnI guess I woulbe interestein your thoughts about whether you see that as a goothing or a bathing when it comes to service, when it comes to price, anjust overall quality for people who travel in rural areas.	N
So if I coulget you to comment--I wouldirect this, I guess, to you, Mr. Administrator--first, on the neefor more information for passengers and, second, the whole issue of consolidation, how that might impact service into rural areas?	N
Mr. Gros, I don't know if you want to comment on either or I am sure you hear from folks up here quite often on issues relateto service aninformation.	N
So if you have any comment on either or both of those issues, I woulbe interestein hearing that as well.	N
AnMr. Chairman, again, I appreciate your answers anI wouljust urge you to continue to focus, anI know you are, in trying to address these problems with congestion on the East Coast aninto New York that create ripple effects throughout the entire system.	N
But this is an issue that is creating a tremendous amount of frustration among the traveling public, as I think you know.	N
Anas I saibefore, there is no question that a lot, not a lot, but some of this is causeby circumstances anfactors that are outside the control of the airlines, that being the weather.	N
But to the degree that there are issues that are within the control, these things just neeto be addressed.	N
Anthe numbers anthe statistics, particularly in this last year, are just unacceptable.	N
I want to talk about the 4,000 employees that have receivee-mails that they are going to be laioff on March 1.	N
Now you are requireto give them written notice, anI am not going to argue about an e-mail versus written notice.	N
But it is serious because these people come from your research, your engineering, your development division, your facilities, your equipment division.	N
Your air traffic controllers are, I believe, under contract until sometime in the middle of 2009.	N
We have to, Mr. Chairman--anwe have to do it in the Finance Committee--we have to make an extension because this is a very severe crisis.	N
You cannot address 4,000 people by e-mail anhave them facing layoffs March 1 because, in effect, it is laying them off right then.	N
Their psychology changes, their attitude at work changes, anthey are frightened, as they shoulbe.	N
We have to work out with Senator Baucus anthe Finance Committee a way of extending--we have massive budget problems, anI won't get into the reasons why.	N
The Chairman of the Finance Committee only wants to make the extension for these 4,000 employees to be paifor a couple of months, anthat doesn't work.	N
So he anI anKay Bailey Hutchison neeto talk to make sure that at least it is extendeto the enof the fiscal year.	N
That, in itself, doesn't provide a whole lot of comfort, but it is probably all that we can do in this particular year.	N
But my question, my first question to you--I only have two--is do you detect an effect, anI want you to answer this to your own advantage, do you detect an effect on 4,000 FAA employees not having receivea pink slip, but having receivean e-mail saying they will be out of a job as of March 1st?	N
On April 23, The Washington Post haan article calle``FAA Has Some Unhappy Controllers.''	N
Now you have a lot of people sort of become unhappy because they are under pressure anbecause they are underfunded.	N
What The Post founwas that 17 percent of FAA employees in general, only 17 percent, saithat they trust FAA management.	N
Anthat 61 percent disagreewith the statement that the FAA ``is committeto employee concerns.''	N
That is far anaway above, I woulthink, the average and, to me, is a very dangerous situation.	N
I won't get into general aviation anwhat you are going to do about it, but I sure will when we have our hearing next week.	N
I won't release it or use it, anI won't use it in this Committee, but I woullike to know.	N
Visits by you are nice, the pay is already there, anthe discontent is huge despite all of this.	N
It may have to do with the uncertainty of the history of the FAA in recent years because we keep cutting their budget anasking you to do more, as passengers anairplanes increase.	N
But I woullike to have from you to me a confidential letter in which you open yourself up to what you think will be requireto change those numbers around.	N
Mr. Sturgell, Mr. Gros, as you know, Minnesota is the home of a prouairline history, with Northwest Airlines, Sun Country, the childhoohome of Charles Lindbergh.	N
I just wanteto follow up a little bit what Senator Thune habeen talking about, about the FAA's role in any merger approvals.	N
Are there any examples you have of past mergers where the FAA stooin ansaithere is such a reduction of employees that this leads to safety concerns or that changes have been made that leato safety concerns?	N
I also want to follow up on some of the questions about delays anthat 2007 was the worst year for delays.	N
As you know, I am supportive of funding the modernization program in any way we can anto figure out how to ramp this up.	N
But given what we have going on right now, some experts have saithat congestion andelay is, in large part, due to the scheduling of flights during peak morning hours anevening rush hours.	N
Do you think that if the carriers voluntarily cut back on their flights during that time, we are going to see a decrease in congestion andelay?	N
What do you think woulbe a gooremedy for this in our current situation before we do the modernization?	N
One of the things I have hearis that if you put these caps on, it is going to cause major carriers to cut back on some of the less profitable routes.	N
Because I have hearthere are some concerns that you have some rate, a high rate, of people leaving once they start, or the job isn't what they thought anit is not working out.	N
Are they placeright in hub airports, or are they alloweto go to smaller airports first, or how does that work?	N
As I have paiattention in the news, I don't think that most Americans have put all of these stories together.	N
July 11, 2007, a jet came within 100 feet of a taxiing jet while landing in Fort Lauderdale.	N
January 2, 2008, a jet hato abort a landing in order to avoihitting another jet in Houston.	N
January 11th, a jet came within 1,500 feet of a taxiing jet while landing at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson.	N
January 16, 2008, two jets came within 600 feet of each other vertically in the airspace above Newark.	N
I have a horrible fear that something dramatic antragic is going to happen, anI have a sense of urgency about this.	N
AnI woullike to give you a minute to try to put into words what sense of urgency you have.	N
Anwhile we have haa--I get your point that the serious incursions decreaselast year, we have haa 12 percent increase, anwe are now near the recorhigh of 2001, isn't that correct, in overall incursion incidents?	N
I take it from your answer that you do think fatigue coulbe a contributing factor or is a contributing factor.	N
Well, if controller fatigue is on the NTSB's Most WanteList anGAO has citefatigue as a major issue, I know--anthis has been covereby some of the other questioning, but I want to make sure that I get your commitment.	N
There has been a recommendation that you work collaboratively directly with the air traffic controllers association.	N
AnI want to hear your commitment that you are willing to work directly with the air traffic controllers association to deal with this issue of fatigue.	N
Because the impression that I got from reading all of the backup material for the hearing today was that you hanot been willing to work one-on-one with the controllers on this particular issue, as NTSB harecommended.	N
Anwhat you are saying is that is no longer the case, that you are now willing to work with them one-on-one on this issue?	N
You certainly come to this position with an impressive resume with your many years at the FAA, as well as having haexperience in all sectors of aviation, both commercial anmilitary.	N
Mr. Sturgell, anI want to reiterate some of the issues that my colleagues have raised, most specifically my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, with whom I have joineto introduce the passenger bill of rights as part of the FAA reauthorization that, regrettably, is stalleon the floor of the Senate at a time in which this legislation shoulbe moving forward.	N
Pivotal moments, of course, facing the aviation industry ancertainly the FAA with a complexity of problems, it is unfortunate that this legislation has stalled.	N
It is the bottom line, it is the minimum standards that we ought to assert that the industry ought to meet.	N
I mean, they have hathe opportunity for almost a decade now with the Voluntary Agreement back in 1999, where they woulset minimum standards for passenger services.	N
I mean, whether it is fooanwater anminimum time where they have to stay encampeon the plane on the tarmac, that hasn't happened.	N
Angiven the fact that it hasn't gotten better, I mean, after we saw what happeneeven in December.	N
AnI always maintain the amount of money people pay for passenger tickets today, they don't get much in return in terms of customer guarantees that they are going to get what they paifor.	N
They face endless delays, certainly not much fooon the aircraft, annot necessarily going to get to where they want to go.	N
So what is the problem with the FAA insisting, requiring the industry to meet these minimum standards?	N
I understanthe states of Washington, New Jersey, anArizona are in the process of also adopting some type of passenger bill of rights.	N
So, first of all, I woulbe interesteto know, in your position, whether or not the FAA woulhonor those laws that are passeby individual states.	N
Anthird, whether or not you are prepareto accept a certain standaranrequiring that of the industry?	N
We have given the industry, I think, a lengthy perioof time, almost a decade, to follow through on these commitments, anI think these are basic issues that the industry ought to be able to comply with.	N
I mean, we all experience many frustrations at the airports, but you really have the opportunity to witness firsthanthe desperate situations that so many airline customers are facewith.	N
Aneven the Inspector General saithat the Voluntary Agreement of 1999 has been ineffective.	N
Even in the hearing that was helhere in the Committee, he testifiethat things have only gotten worse.	N
So I don't see what the hesitancy is on the part of the FAA to assert certain standards ought to be the minimum we woulrequire the industry, given the amount of money, given the investments that the U.S. taxpayer makes with respect to the aviation industry.	N
I mean, there is no question that the Federal Government makes an enormous commitment to the aviation industry.	N
So I think we do have an obligation to ensure that they are operating consistent with the rights of passengers.	N
So I hope that we don't make this a complex issue because it shoulbe basic issues, whether it is on fooor water or the limiteamount of time that they shoulbe requireto stay on an airplane if it is delayeanthey are sitting out on the tarmac.	N
But we also know there is overcongestion anthe way in which these airlines have scheduletheir takeoffs.	N
That it is clear that the way the airlines are scheduling today anthe way they are operating it only is a prescription for disaster.	N
So I hope that we can--I hope that you in your leadership position can assert that leadership in making sure that it is accomplished.	N
Well, I appreciate that because I think the FAA is at a point in time where you are facing a confluence of events.	N
Anbureaucratic nature is not going to be helpful to the process at a time you know the complex problems.	N
But we have got some systemic anfundamental issues that have to be addressed, ancertainly the FAA reauthorization initiative is very important.	N
Aneven in my State of Maine anboth the city of PortlananBangor, I mean, Bangor has seven certifiecontrollers anfour are able to retire today.	N
They are not able to retire because that woulleave three of them, anthere are four pending trainees.	N
Anyet there are not a sufficient number of trainees available to prepare so that they coulretire.	N
So that is another major issue that I hope that you are going to be addressing during the course of your tenure in an aggressive way.	N
Finally, I know that--I gather that you have been part of this process evaluating what will be done in the New York metropolitan area with the three major airports anproviding a cap.	N
Anobviously, from the perspective of my state andepending on airlines being able to go in anout of those airports, are you considering the impact on smaller areas annon-hub communities, for example, in terms of that cap anthe allocation of slots?	N
So can those--can my commuters in Maine be assurethat they won't be negatively affecteor adversely or disproportionately affected, I shoulsay, with respect to those caps?	N
I mean, smaller communities oftentimes are on the short end, anyet they are contributing taxpayers andeserve the right to have access to major airports anconsistent airline schedules.	N
But I do think the FAA does have a responsibility because every state shoulhave the opportunity to have some access to major airports because there are only so many major airports, anyou have to fly there.	N
It is not just simply a private responsibility since the taxpayers are financing much of the aviation industry aninfrastructure that depends on it.	N
So I woulhope that we woulmake sure that smaller communities anrural communities anstates are considerein the context because it is only fair.	N
Because there have been so many times where there have been proposals that woulhave adversely affectesmaller communities anstates as a result of the effect of those proposals.	N
I thank you for your patience, anI thank Mr. Sturgell anMr. Gros as well for continuing to stay with us.	N
We discuss population for posts filled, anthere is always a disagreement, or as long as I can remember there is a disagreement, between the number of full-performance controllers antrainees anso forth.	N
Anwhen we examine the recoranwe look back at a time when I hathe opportunity to talk to Madam--to the Administrator Blakey anI askea question about working conditions with air traffic controller workforce, there hadn't been any negotiateagreement with the representatives of NATCA, anMs. Blakey said, ``I think the effect of the work rules anpay that we put into place in September dicause an uptick in retirements last fall.''	N
I think it was a negative reaction on the part particularly of some of the controllers to that.''	N
One of the questions that has arisen, Mr. Sturgell, is the management anthe morale of FAA, anyou were part of that management, very frankly.	N
But in Sunday's Washington Post, there was a story that saiabout 14,857 controllers on the staff as of late December, 11,000 were certifiecontrollers, or 74 percent of the workforce.	N
in 2000, we ha12,576 controllers, as contrasteto 11,026, when there is a lot more activity now than there was then.	N
They were the fully certifieds out of 15,153 controllers in 2000, about 83 percent of the workforce.	N
Now it is being saithat we have 11,026, compareto 12,576; 74 percent of the workforce are fully trained--	N
Anyet we can't seem to get an agreement from you, Mr. Sturgell, that says that we have got to do a heck of a lot more than we have.	N
Because there has not only been substantial retirement, but departures for other reasons, including the changes in the work rules.	N
AnI woullike you to responspecifically to these comments made in the GAO report anin The Washington Post.	N
I have a question about what we have done to provide the safety mechanism that we shoulhave.	N
Anit says here in the GAO report, ``FAA is not following its order issuein 2002 that directs the Office of Runway Safety to coordinate anmonitor activities throughout the agency to ensure that runway safety goals are met.	N
The absence of coordination annational leadership impedes further progress on runway safety because no single office is taking charge of assessing the causes of runway safety problems antaking the steps needeto address these problems.''	N
Well, the report, the order, was issuein 2002, half a dozen years ago, anit sounds like we are still trying to play catch-up.	N
That is the total cost of the New Jersey anNew York Airspace Redesign project, do you know what that cost is going to be?	N
I will tell you what I woulappreciate, I woulask you to submit it in writing to me, please, so that we have it for the record.	N
Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for your patience, the opportunity to review all of these questions, anwe thank the witnesses for their participation.	N
You have hearthe frustrations of the Committee on delays ansuch, but we all recognize that you are not Superman.	N
Anso, though we may be requiring you to do the impossible, we just hope you can do the best.	N
Anat this point, I think we shoulbe thanking you anthe agency for making the air transportation in the UniteStates the safest in the world.	N
I will be submitting a few questions, technical ones that I wantejust for clarification.	N
I'm grateful to the Chairman for asking me to chair this hearing so that we might have the opportunity to present these nominations to the floor as soon as possible.	N
We know the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department is extensive, ranging from development of telecommunications aninformation policy issues to the state of fisheries anthe oceans, anthe Department is launching many challenging initiatives in all of the areas of its expertise, including NOAA.	N
Her presence is requireat the mark-up of another Committee where I shoulbe, also, but she's askethe Chairman to introduce her statement in the recoranit will be introducein the record.	N
So I woullike to begin with you, Ms. Claffee, to be nominateto be the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce.	N
So it's just not possible, but I'm heartwarmeby your comment about your father anlook forwarto working with you.	N
Our next witness is Dr. William Brennan, Assistant Secretary for Oceans anAtmosphere at the Department of Commerce.	N
As one who sort of is involvewith the oceans, also, I welcome your experience anyour know-how to this position in NOAA.	D
We look forwarto working with you anI will recommento the Chairman that we try to have a meeting of the Committee anreport these nominations out so they might be confirmejust as quickly as possible.	N
I am delighteto be before the Committee to introduce a frienana fellow Alaskan, Vice Admiral Thomas J. Barrett, who is President Bush's nominee to serve as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation.	D
I have known Admiral Barrett anhis wife, Sheila, since my service in the Alaska State legislature, back in Juneau, when Admiral Barrett was serving as the Commander of the 17th Coast GuarDistrict.	D
At that time, I haan opportunity to come to know Admiral Barrett, his wife, his family, just as genuine Alaskans.	N
Now, I must tell you, they hail from other parts of the country, but we have adoptethem as Alaskans.	N
We know that their heart--when they left the state, a part of their heart was left with us, anwe are glato call them Alaskans.	N
Admiral Barrett has a very distinguishebackground: graduatefrom the Coast GuarOfficer Candidate School, was commissionein 1969, servein Vietnam, earnea law degree from George Washington, graduatein residence from the Army War College.	N
He, as I indicated, haserveas the Commander of the 17th Coast GuarDistrict in Alaska, but, again, responsibilities anduties all over, including the Office of Chief Counsel, the project staff for Outer Continental Shelf Safety, Security, anEnvironmental Protection.	D
I was able to introduce Admiral Barrett at a hearing, just last year, when he was nameas the first Pipeline anHazardous Material Safety Administrator for the Department of Transportation.	D
I hathe opportunity to deal with him on some very difficult issues, but founa man who not only knew his background, but was an incredible administrator, incredible leader, angreatly appreciatethat service.	D
He has continueto holthat post as the Pipeline anHazardous Materials Safety Administrator while simultaneously taking on the duties as the Acting Deputy Secretary of Transportation.	D
When he contacteme to let me know that he habeen nominateby the President for this, I tolhim that I hasome mixefeelings.	N
I didn't want to lose him anall the focus that he hagiven in his capacity, but he assureme that he woulremain committeto all that we habeen working on, while, at the same time, stepping up to assume the responsibilities as Deputy Secretary of Transportation.	D
I have every reason to believe that the 40 years of service that he has provideto this country will continue to be built upon in an exemplary manner.	D
I am delighted, this morning, to introduce Admiral Barrett anto recommenhim for confirmation as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation.	D
Senator Olympia Snowe has askeme to announce her very strong support for the nomination of Mr. Brubaker, in light of his service to the citizens of the State of Maine.	D
Unfortunately, because of scheduling conflicts, she cannot be with us, but she urgeme to convey her regret in not being able to attenthis meeting.	N
In addition, Senators Warner anWebb, of Virginia, have submittestatements in support of Mr. Spoehel.	D
I don't think I neeto mention to our witness that my state depends upon air transportation more than any other state in the union.	N
Well, I even challenge that, Mr. Chairman, because we have 241 villages, 70 percent of our areas can be reacheonly by air year round.	N
We have more general aviation per capita than, I think, anywhere in the world, anyet we have to rely upon this type of transportation, the unscheduleplanes that fly footo our villages, anmedical service.	N
They do every single thing that taxis anbuses antrains do in what we call the ``South 48.''	N
So I think rural air service is absolutely essential to our State, anI hope you have been to Alaska.	N
So we are prouto be part of that activity of proving new technology, anwe want to hasten the advent of new technology.	N
But we want to preserve the ability to continue to have these small aircraft fly anfly safely for our people.	N
So I look forwarto working with you, anI really thank the Chairman for having this hearing.	N
I think that it is essential that that one spot that you will occupy be filleas quickly as possible.	N
Mr. Hewko, I have been reading your background, anI think that we shoulcongratulate you for being willing to leave the very interesting position you have hato take on this very serious andifficult job.	D
AnI am interestein particular that you were a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, your time that you spent overseas.	D
I am sure you have seen the difference between traveling in Europe antraveling in the UniteStates.	D
I like to reminpeople that my State alone is larger than Italy, Germany, France, anSpain.	N
So that is at least five times the area that Europe deals with on their daily transportation that we deal with, very complex mechanism, but one that has to be improved.	N
New technology will give us the opportunity to decrease the spacing between these large planes that now lanat better than 100 miles an hour.	N
AnI do think that a person with your backgrounwill have the ability to take a look at this situation ansee what can be done now.	D
We get increasing complaints, I am sure you know, from the public, the traveling public as far as these delays anthe failure to be able to handle some of the things that happen these days.	N
Have you haa chance to be briefeas far as your activities as far as the transportation side of your job as compareto the international affairs side of your job?	N
Well, how much do you feel that your task will involve international affairs as compareto domestic affairs?	N
Have you haany occasion to study the European systems of regulation of traffic as compareto ours?	N
I do hope you will take a chance to learn something about that before you make judgments concerning the activities of rural general aviation anwhat it means to this country.	N
That is why we woullike to have you visit Alaska ansee some of the places that small planes serve.	N
In days gone by, it was the dog slein summer anwalking, literally walking--it was in the wintertime when my first partner walkefrom Nome to Fairbanks, when he wanteto move to Fairbanks.	N
But we now rely on general aviation in such ways as I am becoming too redundant here annow, but I do hope that you will take time to understangeneral aviation before you make decisions that might affect us in the international area.	N
The recorwill show that Mr. Hewko has fileall the necessary documents, respondeto all, anI think people shoulreayour record.	N
Without objection, this matter will be referreto the full Committee on Thursday, anat that time, I am certain it will be approveanreporteto the Senate.	N
I have workewith many of you over the years in this very committee room, spent a number of years I think on the perch right next to Senator Nelson.	N
So we appreciate the goowork that you all do to promote particularly sensible science anscientific integrity.	D
AnDr. Jane Lubchenco's career has essentially been built arounthose kinds of principles.	D
But when you look at her extraordinary track record, I think it is fair to say she is the bionic woman of gooscience.	D
For example, she has already serveas scientific advisor to two different administrations.	D
She servePresident Clinton, for example, for two terms on the National Science Board, anshe was part of the National Academy of Sciences in a climate change report to President George Herbert Walker Bush.	D
So I think all of us who have toileon this climate change issue understanit is not exactly for the faint-hearted.	N
You are going to have to be bipartisan, anDr. Lubchenco has already shown with her previous service anthe respect she won in two different administrations that she is a very up to that.	D
At Oregon State, Dr. Lubchenco has hathe opportunity to confront many of the issues that NOAA is going to face on a daily basis.	D
She has worketo bring her conclusions home, again advising policymakers of both political parties.	D
``She has shown that while science shoulbe excellent, pure, andispassionate, scientists shoulnot sacrifice a right anmust not ignore the responsibility to communicate their knowledge about how the earth is changing or to say what they believe will be the likely consequences of different policy options.''	D
So we have in Dr. Lubchenco somebody who has been driven by the effort to dispassionately finthe facts.	D
She has been nameone of the most highly citeecologists in the world, anas I mentioned, for her great record, she has repeatedly been recognized.	D
She is such a valuable asset anhas won so much respect from scientists across the philosophical spectrum anpolicymakers that we woulnot give her up unless there were a chance to come to the aiof our country at a critical time.	D
Everyone in this room understands that if we are going to make enduring changes in climate change, they are going to have to be bipartisan.	N
That is what Dr. Lubchenco's career has been all about, anit is why I come before you today to give her a recommendation this morning anlook forwarto her serving in this critical position.	N
Senator Wyden, I greatly appreciate your very kinremarks, anI value the time that you took to come here today.	N
I am here with the love ansupport of a wonderful family, anI wish to thank my 91-year-olmother, a pediatrician, my late father, a surgeon anArmy captain for enabling their six daughters to pursue their dreams while instilling in each of us a strong sense of values, family, love, anheritage.	N
I am very pleasethat my husbanBruce anmy son Duncan are able to be here today, anI am grateful to them for their continuing love anencouragement.	N
Anmy thanks to my wonderful staff ancolleagues in Oregon anarounthe country for their overwhelming support.	N
I first became enamorewith the oceans during a college class in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.	N
Little diI realize then that life in the oceans is also essential to human well-being anprosperity along the coasts, as well as inland.	N
I leaa large team of scientists studying the marine ecosystems off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, anCalifornia.	N
We focus on understanding how the ecosystem is changing anhow society might recover ansustain the jobs, recreational opportunities, healthy seafood, anwilbeauty that all depenupon healthy ocean ecosystems.	N
I have spent my entire career focuseon connections, the connections between land, sea, anair anthe connections between people anecosystems.	N
I woulbring to NOAA a firm belief that science shoulinform, not dictate decisionmaking, a deep respect for multiple points of view, a wealth of experience leading complex projects anorganizations.	N
AnI believe that these experiences have prepareme well to serve the Nation by leading NOAA.	N
It is an indispensable partner with the private sector in creating jobs along the coasts aninland.	N
It is a trustestewarof a bounty of marine ancoastal resources, anit is the premier Government agency for appliescience.	N
Working with you anusing the best available science as our guide, here is what I think we couldo.	N
We can ahundreds of millions of new dollars to the economy by bringing back fisheries, both commercial anrecreational.	N
We can improve fishing anfarming, lower insurance rates, anmake air travel safer by improving weather forecasting.	N
We can spur the creation of new industries, for example, by improving climate forecasting to enable better decisions about infrastructure, public safety, anconsumer needs.	N
Anwe can protect anrecover the bays, beaches, rivers, anoceans that amaze, inspire, anconnect us all.	N
My vision for NOAA is strongly coloreby the experiences I hatraveling arounthe country with the Pew Oceans Commission doing public hearings in many coastal communities.	N
The consistent theme that we hearfrom CEOs to fishermen's wives, from farmers to coastal residents was the same: an intimate connection between people anoceans.	N
Now our country must rise to a new challenge, dealing with the impacts of a changing climate.	N
I have hearfirsthanfrom business leaders anelecteofficials about the urgent neefor better information about likely local impacts of climate change.	N
From concern about droughts ansea level rise to changes in the chemistry of the ocean, there is a real hunger for more anbetter information.	N
If confirmed, I will work to create a National Climate Service similar to the National Weather Service within NOAA.	N
NOAA is the best agency in the Government to synthesize the scientific data on climate change ancreate products anservices that can be useby the public to guide important decisions such as where to buila roaor a winturbine.	N
This idea has been studieby the agency, by the National Academy of Sciences, anby this committee.	N
Some of the challenges I know well: ending overfishing, anticipating the consequences of climate change, preparing for natural disasters in a time when resources are tight, restoring ecosystems on which we depenfor food, water, livelihoods another challenges I am just learning.	N
If confirmed, I woulwork harwith Members of this Committee anthe Senate anthe House in realizing the great potential inherent in NOAA.	N
Together, we can provide America the best climate change science, restore her oceans' vitality, anrecharge our economy, putting us on a path to sustainability.	N
My first question is administrative basically, but I think it was saiby Senator Wyden--anI think all of us who have serveon this committee agree that we have been bipartisan anwe have been very strong for science antechnology anresearch.	N
My question to both of you is, will our Committee, every member of our Committee, minority as well as majority, be able to call your offices for help within your agencies with data that we might need?	N
In other words, will you answer questions angive the same type of help to every member of our Committee?	N
Let me just say a couple of things that are very important to me in the experience that I have haon this committee.	N
Number one is the great neethat was shown in the report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' for more research into the basic sciences to stay on top of the fields of the harsciences and, second, the encouragement of teaching anrecruiting young people to be interestein taking the courses in middle anhigh school so that they will take the courses in college, which I think you addressesomewhat.	N
But in the National Science Foundation, for instance, the social sciences have become I think a fairly large part, sometimes taking away from the harsciences.	N
AnI hope that we can know where our needs are anour priorities right now, anthat is to stay on top of the innovation antechnological advances that have kept our economy strong through the years.	N
Second, my colleague, Senator Nelson, anI have been very interestein NASA anspace, anthe fact that we are going to have a gap of 5 or 6 years when Americans will not be able to fly into space is not acceptable to us.	N
AnI woullike to ask Dr. Holdren if you are committein your position in the White House to perhaps having the National Space Council revivewhere there is a policy focus on the concerns that we have about our space flight gap, as well as the ability to use the Space Station for basic research, which was a function of Senator Nelson's anmy authorization of NASA that we didesignate a part of the Space Station as a national laboratory so that there coulbe more research influx from outside agencies, which has begun to occur.	N
Let me just say--anI do have a question for Dr. Lubchenco--that I woulaNASA in there as well for the capabilities to use the Space Station another areas of basic scientific research that can be done best in space, as you are prioritizing.	N
The other issue that I have--for the past two Congresses, I have introducelegislation to increase weather modification anmitigation research.	N
My original bill was to put it in NOAA because I thought that woulbe the better place for it.	N
I dinot get anywhere, anit was suggestethat perhaps we shoulput it in the White House to be in the science office, the OSTP.	N
My question to you is--I really think it shoulbe in NOAA with support from OSTP, but here is my question.	N
There are today 14 agencies of the Federal Government overlooking, overseeing, anpromoting research into climate change, which clearly means there is no focus anno strategy that has really brought us into what I think is a cohesive policy.	N
But mitigation anmodification has really not come to the forefront, anwith the violence in weather that we see, which has certainly hit my State, has hit Senator Martinez anSenator Nelson's State very hard--we just saw it in Oklahoma last week--I believe it is time for us to step back ansay is there something that we are doing that is making a difference in this violence of weather or is there something we couldo that woulaffect it, either pro or con.	N
For instance, is there something that coulbe done to lessen the impact of a hurricane when it is still out in the far miles of the ocean away from land, or is there something that coulbe done in tornadoes, or is there something that is happening when we actually do weather modification in clouseeding in one area that makes an avalanche occur in another area?	N
But it seems to me that if we are going to look at climate change, weather mitigation and/or modification shoulalso be something that we try to do research on to determine if there is something that can be done or if something is done in one place, woulit affect another place.	N
AnI woulask both of you to address if you think this is worthy, where you think it woulmost likely reside, anwouleither of you be willing to help work on something that woulmove this priority up in the climate change arena as well.	N
I have to say of all the nominees by the President for his Cabinet or for White House appointments that I have interviewed, Dr. Lubchenco is the most engaging anqualified.	D
AnI haa delightful meeting with her, anI have absolutely no questions of her because with all the ones I askeher yesterday she was spot-on.	N
But Dr. Holdren, who I am sorry I dinot get the chance to meet with, in your opening statement made a statement that hits at the heart of the discussion we hayesterday, Dr. Lubchenco.	N
But it is really important because we are so concernethat opinions overtake facts, anthe next thing you know you are making decisions baseon an insight but not really sounscientific evidence.	N
Well, I appreciate that answer, which is very much similar to the answer that Dr. Lubchenco gave me yesterday.	N
AnI look forwarto working with you anwith NOAA when we deal with these issues that affect my State or really our region, because most all these are interstate issues not intrastate issues, to make sure we are always getting the best scientific evidence we can to dictate the right policy that affects the people we represent.	N
Picking up on the Ranking Member's questions--anby the way, Mr. Chairman, I am really exciteto be the chairman of the Science anSpace Subcommittee.	N
I am really very exciteabout the quality of nominees that we have in front of us, anI am very hearteneby their answers.	D
Now, just following up on Senator Hutchison's comments about changing weather, we might not be able to change weather, but we can sure try to track weather anmore accurately measure it.	N
I have the privilege of chairing that Subcommittee in the ArmeServices Committee as well, anI want to work with you on that to see if we can smooth this out.	N
Now, Dr. Holdren, I was really very hearteneto hear your response to Senator Hutchison about the National Space Council.	N
Just for the record, I want it establishethat then-candidate Obama clearly came out anstatethat he wanteto reactivate the National Space Council within the White House.	N
Do you want to say any more for the recorhere about that in addition to what you have saito Senator Hutchison?	N
Well, that is great because one of the failings in the past--annot just with this immediate past Administration, but previous ones--is that NASA becomes the handmaiden of the Office of Management anBudget.	N
Anthat is not the way to set policy by having some green eyeshade person over there determining what the policy is, whether we are talking about NASA or NOAA or whatever it is.	N
But that is the way it has been in the past and, therefore, another reason at the high councils of high Government policymaking to have such a council right within the White House.	N
Anhow are you going to coordinate with others that get into energy anclimate change policies, such as Carol Browner, Dr. Chu, Nancy Sutley, as well as the NOAA Administrator?	N
By the way, Dr. Lubchenco, also in accurately measuring the weather: that also directly affects NOAA in having the assets that it needs in space to measure the weather anpreventing a potential problem of the increaseaccuracy.	N
This is a problem that we now have on the paths of hurricanes on that single-point failure: if the G-4 airplane is down for maintenance or because of an accident, there is an issue of having some backup there.	N
You saiat the enof your statement, Dr. Lubchenco, that you want to create a National Climate Service within NOAA.	N
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, anlet me tell you it is a real pleasure to join the Committee anI look forwarto working with you anthe other members of the Committee on issues that are vitally important to our Nation anthe world.	N
I wanteto offer to Dr. Lubchenco anSenator Isakson the opportunity to do their scuba diving trip in the Florida Keys where I think you will finan incredible natural resource in our marine sanctuary, as well as at the Dry Tortugas where the NOAA people do a fantastic job of keeping an eye on that valuable resource as well.	N
For the last two Congresses, I have been working with others in trying to advance legislation that woulpromote a national hurricane research initiative to improve the understanding of hurricanes, as well as the forecasting anpreparedness.	N
This came from a recommendation, a report by the National Science Board, which I woulcommento your reading.	N
It woulmarshal the resources of various Government agencies anresearch universities anprivate sector partners to improve knowledge of hurricane intensity, storm surges, anobservation.	N
The whole concept is that if we know better not only that it is coming next Tuesday but how strong it is going to be or what the surge with it is going to be, because oftentimes we finthat much of the damage, as we know in my colleague, Senator Vitter's State in New Orleans, is the sea surge that sometimes does the greater damage, not the windamage.	N
Woulyou commit to improving, Dr. Lubchenco, our ability to do the research anperhaps to encourage this type of legislation that woulgive you the ability to do better forecasting on hurricanes?	N
We neeto work on mitigation efforts as it relates to hurricanes because I think the damage coulbe greatly reduceif we do the right preparation.	N
Anwhile passing accolades, I think the National Hurricane Center in Miami, by the way--those folks do a tremendous job.	N
There are certain times of the year when those of us who live in vulnerable areas like Florida stay pretty much glueto what they have to say.	N
We have hasome issues in Florida relating to fishing quotas, anit is an area where sometimes a lot of controversy arises because sometimes the research does not match up with what the experience seems to be on the field, if you will.	N
It is an area where I hope perhaps you will attempt to put some common sense into the science to ensure that we are doing what is really best.	N
We want to protect the different species, but at the same time, a lot of people depenon fishing for a livelihoowhether it is relateto commercial fishing or simply tourism anenjoyment.	N
Anwe have run into some conflict there over the recent days, anI wanteto highlight that to you ancommenit for some analysis anstudy on your part.	N
I do not know that I want to take sides on that because I am not a scientist, anI know I want the resources there for my grandchildren, but I also want to make sure that when I hear complaints that sometimes seem to be baseon common sense that we are not putting the practical aspects of this aheaof what might be on a scientific notional basis wrong.	N
With respect to the National Climate Service, having been in the Executive Branch, there is a certain reality, anI do not know how one frees themselves from the clutches of OMB.	N
I never coulmanage that at HUD during the time that I was there, but I wish you well in that to both of you.	N
But the reality is that when you look at initiating something like a national climate service, what is going to suffer or what is going to be--in other words, how do we make that work?	N
I can understanthat, but I do not want it to be at the expense of the other work that is so very important that we are doing with weather today.	N
AnDr. Holdren, in the moment I have remaining, I just wanteto tell you that I workewith a number of other colleagues here on the America COMPETES Act, anI think it is a terribly important initiative.	N
I believe that our competitiveness vis-a-vis the worlis one of our real upcoming challenges which goes beyonclimate another issues, but it really has to do with human capital.	N
I have been involvealso on the issues relating to immigration, anI think as we look forwarto some sort of sensible immigration policy for the future of this country, that we also shoullook to human capital anhow we can utilize the immigration laws--sensible immigration reform that our country so desperately needs--to ensure that we are not just utilizing it as a means of promoting family reunification, but we also view it as a way of improving our competitiveness in the worlanas a natural resource in terms of human capital.	N
Thank you very much, both of you, anthank you for serving anthank you to your families.	N
Anthen I have some general questions baseon your testimony, which I want to follow up.	N
Let me do additional follow up to that with respect to specifically Alaska, where the Alaska community has made a position to ban it.	N
With waters off the shores of Alaska, with respect anunderstanding to where Alaska is anthe communities--anthere is no question in my minwe have the most sustainable fisheries in this country.	N
So how woulyou look at Alaska antheir aspects of what they have done in making that determination or that decision?	N
I think in the past you have been on recorat least with previous administrations utilizing the Antiquities Act to close large areas in the Pacific area.	N
Anit is not requirethat there be a NEPA or that even stakeholders are part of the process.	N
Anhow do you see ensuring that there is a process clearly with stakeholders ana NEPA-like or a NEPA process to ensure that there is a gooscientific evidence that is on the table?	N
I shoulannounce, incidentally, before I call on Senator Snowe, that both Senator Hutchison anI reathe FBI checks on these two distinguishefolks, anit is some of the easiest reading I have ever been through.	N
AnI want to welcome our two distinguishewitnesses, both of whom are steepein peer-based, sounscience which we certainly welcome because so much of the credible science is going to dictate some crucial policies in your respective fields anjointly when it comes to climate change.	N
So the expertise anexperience anbackgrounanqualifications that you both bring to that endeavor is certainly going to be helpful to those of us as policymakers anespecially in some very contentious debates.	D
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, anI look forwarto working haron the issues before this committee facing this Congress.	N
I know there is a lot to do from the reauthorization of the FAA to the digital TV transition, to helping our captive shippers, something that I know you care a lot about.	N
I look forwarto chairing the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, anExport Promotion.	N
I note, Dr. Lubchenco, that everyone keeps inviting you to go scuba diving off the coast of Florida another places.	N
I coulonly invite you to go scuba diving in Lake Superior, which woulbe slightly chilly.	N
In fact, you may have hearI, for 2 years, serveon the Oceans Subcommittee being the only non-ocean Senator on there, but Lake Superior is very important, anthe Great Lakes, to that Subcommittee as well.	N
Anthe economic anenvironmental challenges to our Great Lakes continue to mount on a daily basis, from the depletion of commercial fishing, something Senator Snowe mentioneoff the coast of Maine, to health concerns poseby contaminateseafood, to the local effects of global climate change.	N
They got up slightly last year, but overall they have been at an all-time low anit is believethat is because the ice has meltemore quickly.	N
So the water levels have gone down anour barges are having trouble getting in anit is less economical for commerce.	N
Up in Duluth, we have hamany invasive species that are decimating the lake's ecosystems andamaging with both commercial anrecreational activities.	N
Anthe harbor anopen water infrastructure that useto manage these problems continues to deteriorate with age, something I am sure you will hear about as well from Congressman Oberstar over on the House side.	N
I believe the work of NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory is essential to properly sustain the Great Lakes' ecosystems.	N
AnI wondereyour views about addressing the ongoing environmental initiatives being handleby the Great Lakes laboratory.	N
Anyou also indicateyour support for the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA.	N
As I noted, we really have seen a lot of changes because of the climate change issue, anthey are very different than the sea levels rising.	N
The invasive species issue is something this Committee has grapplewith, anwe woulreally like to do more on that.	N
Anmany of these species enter our waters through the ballast water dischargeby ocean-faring vessels as they enter U.S. ports.	N
We have hasome disputes about getting this done, anI really believe we neeto be pragmatic anget something done on the ballast water issue.	N
AnI know with Senator Cantwell's leadership with the work that she has done with oceans, anthe Chairman's leadership here, I am hopeful we will be able to get something done.	D
As you know, there has been some pending legislation about ballast waters that has been sitting arounfor a while.	N
I hope with our Subcommittee on Innovation anCompetitiveness, we will be able to work with you in the future as well.	N
Well, I woulcall ``seems almost certain'' a prediction, but that is just a difference of opinion.	N
Has all of that dramatically reverseso that this almost certainty has, obviously, been averted?	N
In 1986, you predictethat global warming coulcause the deaths of 1 billion people by 2020.	D
In 1973, you encouragea ``decline in fertility to well below replacement'' in the UniteStates because ``280 million in 2040 is likely to be too many.''	D
Well, since we are at 304 million, I am certainly heartenethat you are not sticking to the 280 million figure.	N
But much more recently, namely a couple weeks ago in response to my written questions, you disay on this matter ``balancing costs anbenefits of population growth is a complex business, of course, anreasonable people can disagree about where it comes out.''	N
I am scareto death that you think this is a proper function of Government, which is what that sentence clearly implies.	N
In 2006, obviously pretty recently, in an article, The War on Hot Air, you suggestethat global sea levels coulrise by 13 feet by the enof this century.	N
Now, in contrast to that, the IPCC's 2007 report put their estimate at between 7 an25 inches.	N
You woulstill say--I think you did--that 1 billion people lost by 2020 is still a possibility?	N
I too look forwarto working with you in your capacity as Chairman of this Committee anworking with you on the Oceans, Atmosphere, anCoast GuarCommittee.	N
I am sure my questions may be seen as a little more specific to the Pacific Northwest region, but I hope you will indulge me because I have many.	N
Obviously, the Columbia River salmon biological opinion has come a long way, but not without a lot of court intervention.	N
So I guess I woullike to start with: do you think that poor management within the Government leto those court interventions andecisions?	N
Anwhat woulyou do to avoithat same--what woulyou change under NOAA to make sure that we do not enup in the courts again?	N
How confident are you, though, that you can keep us out of the courts by having a strong management response, as opposeto punting anthen having the courts decide?	N
A seconissue which you anI have haa chance to talk about in my office is obviously the impact of hurricane-force winds off the coast of Washington, anwe have haquite a bit of damage from this in the last couple of seasons.	N
The Puget SounPartnership is an innovative collaborative effort in the Northwest I think you are familiar with.	N
It is an eco-basemanagement approach to our fisheries anecosystem anocean governance.	N
If confirmed, woulyou put resources towarthis kinof effort in helping Puget Sounon its recovery plans?	N
Obviously, NOAA has already--basically it saithat it believes that it can take this from an endangerespecies to a delisting of the species back to levels, they think, from maybe 28 years ago.	N
So if confirmed, under your leadership, what kinof resources do you see dedicateto delisting that population?	N
Last year the Coast GuarCommandant testifiebefore our Subcommittee that as far as resources, he thought that we hainadequate resources to responto oil spills in the Arctic.	N
AnI want to know if either of you believe that our Government has the capability to effectively responin the Arctic Ocean anwhat the Administration can promise us that we will be doing to better protect that area.	N
Holdren, maybe you can help me on a technology piece here--is as a freshman Senator how you appear at three different hearings that are schedulesimultaneously.	N
One of the areas that I am very interestein that the President has proposeis the creation of a chief technology officer that I believe will be reporting to you.	N
I think it was one of the things that leus to being namethe best-manageState in the country.	N
As you look at the CTO position, do you see it more as an internal function working with the CIO at OMB to bring about greater technology anefficiency inside the Federal Government, or do you see this as another kinof outreach officer to spur innovation across the broader technology community?	N
How about, though, the role--I understanthe CIO role, the CIO role mostly focusing on the IT space, but as you think beyonIT, how you bring technology functionality to internal workings of Government, woulthat be CTO or CIO?	N
anrecognizing it is a new position anit coulhave quite a large brief--I woulhope that you woullook at those States who have maybe gone before.	N
I think actually Senator Cantwell's State, Washington State, has been active in this area, but there may be lessons learned.	N
But what is critically important to Virginia anthe surrounding States is the health of the Chesapeake Bay, anNOAA has playean important role in that.	N
It seems like over the last 25 years, we have been partners with NOAA anwe oftentimes have not even met the thresholds that we woulhave hopeto have met.	N
I woulargue that at least in recent years, the District, Virginia, Maryland, anStates in the bay watershehave actually steppeup with financial resources in fairly substantial amounts.	N
I guess what I woulask is, recognizing you are not even confirmeyet, but do you have a sense of what additional authorities beyonjust funding that NOAA might neeto be a better partner with the States on restoration of the Chesapeake Bay?	N
For example, I know there is a bay monitoring program involving a series of buoys out throughout the bay that seems a little undermanneat this point.	N
But if you couljust speak to that specifically, if you have any knowledge, anthen generally about the bay.	N
I woulsimply athat as the Nation's largest estuary anone that still remains in great jeopardy, I do believe the States in the state compact have steppeup their game over the last 4 or 5 years, both in terms of water standards, in terms of runoff, in terms of funding.	N
But we have not haa collaborative partner at the Federal level, anwe look forwarto having that kinof collaboration going forward.	N
Senator Begich then has a follow-up question, anthen I will have a statement to make before we conclude.	N
This is not part of your responsibility, Dr. Holdren, but I judge you to be of such a high caliber that I know that you will accept this responsibility.	N
I think one of the greatest embarrassments in the UniteStates of America is the fact that we have an air traffic control system which is analog.	N
The consequences of this are overwhelming because if it were to be solved, it might clear up delays by 30 percent or more.	N
What I am saying to you is that we have a President now who seems to be enormously interestein technology anefficiency andoing things in the right way.	N
We have triein our committee to do this, anwe can never get the money because of various reasons.	N
I do not know if the President is aware of this or not because I have not talkewith him about it, but I just hope very much that you will.	N
But as I sat here listening to all the questions, most of them relevant to your positions anthe issues of what you are talking about, Arctic policy is going to be huge.	N
AnI wouljust be interestefrom your perspective--I am a very visual person, anI am afraito ask this question because I am afraiof what the outcome will look like.	N
But how you see anwhom you see will be involvein the decisions of Arctic policy into the future by agency, so a very visual chart for me woulbe very helpful.	N
I am afraito ask for this because I am afraithat every Department division of the Federal Government now believes they have a role in it, which is great, except it will be probably the most disorganizeeffort.	N
So I woulbe curious at some point if you coulprovide to me, whichever one of you that woulbe the most appropriate, a chart of how you see anwhat agencies you see--because I know there are jurisdiction issues.	N
How do you intento make sure that agencies like NOAA have adequate say in our Government's policy choices, especially as it relates to offshore drilling?	N
In a letter commenting on the EIS for the Chukchi Sea oil angas drilling plan, the National Marine Fisheries Service wrote the Minerals Management Service analysis dinot present a strong enough case to NMFS that the marine resources woulbe adequately protected.	N
Yet, this advice, along with similar advice from EPA anFish anWildlife Service, was ignoreby the Minerals Management Service.	N
So what do you intento do to make sure that these agencies who are in charge of protecting these resources are hearon these important issues as it relates to offshore drilling?	N
Well, one area in which I think we neeto better understanthe response is on the Office of Response anRestoration for oil spills, anwe certainly have not fundethat program at the level of the President's request.	N
What do you think the impact of that is on cutting back on our Nation's oil spill response capabilities?	N
I want to thank Ms. Tenenbaum for being here, anI also want to thank Senator Rockefeller for asking me to chair this today.	N
We are on a relatively tight timeframe because we have a vote scheduleon the Senate floor at 11:45 a.m., so what I'propose, with my colleagues' indulgence, is that I'll do a very brief opening statement.	N
If she wants to do an opening statement, that'be great, anthen I'll introduce our introducers, anthen we'll let the nominee speak.	N
Anthen we'll try to keep our questions to 5 minutes, if at all possible, because we'll try to move through these.	N
We understanthere are several Senators on the way, but they've encourageme to get started, given our timeframe this morning.	N
I knew that we were in pretty gooshape when, the day she was announced, we haseveral consumer groups, as well as several business groups, come out in support of her.	N
State Senators, anwe all know--on this Committee, we understanthe trials antribulations of the CPSC over the last few years.	N
I think--just in layman's terms, what has happeneis, the CPSC has haits budget cut, anits resources dwindleas its challenges have increased.	N
Anwhen we saw this huge influx of products that were manufactureoverseas, most notably China, but from a lot of places overseas, the CPSC just, quite frankly, was not able to keep pace with that anwas overwhelmed.	N
Unfortunately, since that bill was passed, there has been a lot of controversy about the implementation of that.	N
So, Ms. Tenenbaum, assuming that she is confirmed, which I don't think there's any question about that at this point, baseon what I know, she will inherit a lot of things that she has to get in order, anthings to fix, anwe are very delightethat you're here.	N
So, until Senator Hutchison gets here, if I may, what I may do is introduce Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for a statement.	N
It's a big honor for all of the people in South Carolina to have Inez nominatefor such an important job.	N
AnI call her ``Inez'' because everybody that knows her feels very comfortable with her as a person.	D
The Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission really holds a public trust, anI can assure you that the American consumer antheir families are going to be in goohands with Inez at the helm of this very important public-	N
We hathe fastest advancement of any State in the Nation, in terms of national testing among our student population, anthat was a real desire of hers, to make sure that our students improved.	N
Anat the enof her tenure, our State was recognizeas having the most rigorous academic standards, assessment, anaccountability system in the Nation.	D
You know, in education you can devise a test for the teachers, or for the students, ana lot of people, you know, make sure that everybody does well on the test.	N
She produced, I think, the most challenging test in the Nation to evaluate our students, anthe goal is to bring out the best in the students of South Carolina.	D
Rigor will be applieto the products coming online that will be put into the free market, anI just coulnot think of a better person with the executive experience.	N
She has, like I say, been arounpolitics most of my life, anis the type of person that--Sam's life too--she's the type of person that everybody, whether you agree with her or not, respects, anthis is a job where the American consumer needs to understanthat they have somebody on their side.	D
The only blemish on her recorI can see is that she has a Bachelor of Science ana Master's from the University of Georgia.	D
But, all joking aside, I remember what last year was like, what this Committee went through, anInez Tenenbaum has the exact experience we neeand, more than anything else, the heart for what we neehere.	D
She will look out for the American public, anshe will give the American people the leadership they deserve.	D
My only reservation in endorsing Inez is that that endorsement might hurt her with this Committee, so I hope that----	N
She is a serious nominee for this position, who has dealt with all of the issues in a large, controversial, public agency in South Carolina, andithat with professionalism anstyle.	D
And, as some of you know, she anI were in a hard-fought race for the Senate in 2004, anI was very exciteto hear about the nomination.	N
There's absolutely no reason that we can't move her through in a hurry, anput her at the helm of this agency, which as the Chairman has pointeout, has a lot of challenges.	N
Senator Graham, you're certainly welcome to stick around, but we understanyou have a very heavy schedule.	N
No, Mr. Chairman, I'like to hear from her, anthen I will incorporate my opening statement into my questions.	N
We appreciate your interest in public service anyour willingness to take on this agency anall its very, very important tasks anresponsibilities.	N
For the Senators who have just arrived, it looks like we have a vote schedulefor 11:45, unless somebody tells me that changes.	N
Anwhat I'like to do is have everyone submit their opening statements for the record, anjust dive right into questions.	N
I think it's fair to say, anI think most people woulagree, that there is an issue of morale at the Consumer Product Safety Commission right now, just for various reasons, and--coulyou talk a little bit about your management style ansome of the things you woullike to see happen at CPSC? 	N
I mean, I think you neea little bit of time to get your feet wet anget our bearings there at that agency.	N
So, as issues present themselves, I'm sure the Committee woulappreciate hearing from you on various things, whatever they may be, challenges, successes, whatever they may be.	N
AnI think it's probably a gooidea, maybe, for you to come back to the--either the Committee formally, or have a meeting informally with us, say, in--I'll just say 60 days after your confirmation, to give us a sense of how things are going.	N
Anif there are specific issues that are still out there, maybe we can talk about those in detail once you're there.	N
I was very pleaseto have a meeting with Ms. Tenenbaum last week, anI was very encouragewith her talk of her recorof working with the South Carolina legislature in her position as heaof education in the State.	D
However, there are some glitches, as often happens with legislation, ansome areas where there have been differences of opinion about the intent of some of the language.	N
First is the requirequestion that the Ranking Member always asks, anthat is that our committee has always workewell with staff in the agencies, anthe heads of agencies; anwhen we are developing or proposing legislation, we neetheir technical expertise.	N
Anmy question is, can all of our members of the Committee count on being able to call in to your agency for the expertise that we might neeto help us draft legislation, or to exercise our responsibility in oversight?	N
Well, one thing I think our committee probably will neeto do is have a hearing on the Act that we passelast year, to see where the kinks are, ansee where we neeto do some technical corrections.	N
We discussesome of the unintenderesults impacting thrift stores, charity sales, small businesses, anyou usethe wor``common sense'' in your description of what you think is right in the enforcement arena.	N
So, I woulask you if you think the law gives you sufficient flexibility for the common sense enforcement that I think we agree is the right standard?	N
Anwhere do you think it doesn't give enough flexibility, anthe law is clear, even if it is pretty harto enforce?	N
Where you have founthat a business needs more time to comply with the law, do you think the stays of enforcement are sufficient, or do you think we neeto revisit, maybe, that area of the law to give more flexibility, again, when a business does neemore time?	N
Or, in the situation with the youth ATV vehicles, where there needs to be some other approach.	N
We, in our professional life here, have a chance to meet candidates for office that are recommended, anit's so nice, very frankly, when we have someone who is here, presenting themselves to the Committee, who have the kinof backgrounthat you have, which is, I think, perfectly suiteto taking the responsibility that you're about to take.	N
News reports have shown the popularity among children with toy guns that look like real AK-	N
As a matter of fact, in some instances, young people have been killeby police officers who believe, because these guns look so realistic, that they're holding a weapon, anthe consequence is terrible.	N
In 2007, we hasomething like 11,000 injuries from toy guns, whether it's in the production of these things, or whether it's the way the parts are put together.	N
But last year--you were discussing morale a moment ago with the Chairman--I sent a letter to the CPSC asking it to investigate this issue, but I never receivea response.	N
Now, I'm hoping that, with your confirmation, that you'll work with me to review the safety of these guns.	N
Last year, I met with a New Jersey family whose daughter was severely injuredue to a crib that collapsed.	N
Oddly enough, my wife's daughter, my step-daughter, haa baby, anshe's just turning a year old, anI was with her this weekend, anshe was chewing the paint off the crib.	N
Aneven though these things are leafree, I don't think it's very healthy for children to have paint chips in their system.	N
Now, under your leadership, will the CPSC require cribs to be testeso--to prove that they are durable anwill not collapse under pressure?	N
Despite the high number of recalls on children's products, consumers rarely return recalleproducts.	N
As a matter of fact, it's only--it's estimatethat only 5 percent of the time do they do so.	N
I hope that you'll increase outreach with the--with a full complement of staff so--to make consumers aware of the recalls of dangerous products.	N
pretenfor the moment that you are Chairman, anthat you will look to see that, when there is a recall, that a reason is producefor doing so, anthat you'll do your best to alert the public to the importance of accepting a recall anreturning the product.	N
You've really coverea lot of my concerns with the current law, anwords like ``common sense'' encourage me.	N
It seems, perhaps, not beneficial--and, Inez, you anI have talkea fair amount about this law anwhether or not we neelegislation.	N
But, just one comment that goes under the umbrella of common sense is, that the goal is more safety, not more regulation.	N
Anthe problem we often have is--we develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme, that tends to favor large companies who have contingents of lawyers anpeople who can deal with them.	N
Anin this country, there are a lot of small manufacturers of a lot of products, a lot of small toy manufacturers, anhandmade toys.	N
Ansome of the law has been interpretein a way that woulmake it very difficult for these companies to do the type of testing that woulbe necessary to comply in any way that they coulafforto do it.	N
AnI wouljust ask you, as you look at this, is to remember that the whole point of this is not to run small companies out of business.	N
But, if we have such a heavy regulatory scheme, it may be very difficult for them to afforthe tests that are requireto comply.	N
There are often other ways to do that, such as, make sure the components are tested, not necessarily the final product.	N
But, I wouljust appeal to you to do everything you can to make sure that we make our products safer, but also keep America a gooplace to make products.	N
And, you know, one of the former, I think, most memorable, Chairmen of this Committee, Fritz Hollings, is a great fan of yours.	N
AnI figure that anyone who has earnethe admiration anrespect of Senator Fritz Hollings, Senator Lindsey Graham anSenator Jim DeMint is the person of great ability.	D
Anthe ability to bring people together anto win their respect, means so much in the role that you're going to play.	D
But, I just want to make sure you know that it was in the 1980s, when I came to Congress, that all of our regulations were baseon protecting a 155-pounman.	N
If you go--if you protect a 155-pounman, a healthy man, it's going to be goofor all those guys who are in that category.	N
But, the vulnerable folks--the children, the pregnant women, those with disabilities, anso on--are not protected.	N
AnI think that was our goal when we wrote this law that you are going to finyourself in the middle of, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.	N
So, I guess that my one question is, can you assure me that, in your work, that you will put the children first?	N
We'll all be protected, anyet you're going to do it in a way that allows responsible companies to make gooproducts ansell those products.	N
AnI'm just so exciteabout your nomination, anextremely pleaseat the bipartisan support you've receivethus far.	N
I know this is kinof a chorus we're hearing from both sides, but I want to amy strong support of Inez.	N
As I've hathe opportunity to work with her in politics, I've hathe opportunity to work with her when she disuch a great job in education in South Carolina.	D
AnI think you are absolutely the right person at the right time for an agency that has truly been troubled.	N
looking arounthis room, there are a series of other distinguisheSouth Carolinians who are here to show support for you.	N
I hope you're not paying all of them, because some of them are, you know, pretty expensive, high-pricefolks here in town now.	N
I know, I think, when the Chairman was initially talking, as we came in, he haraisean issue that he has playea leadership role on, along with Senator Landrieu, Senator Martinez anSenator Nelson, from Louisiana anFlorida, respectively, anthat's this Chinese drywall issue.	D
I can tell you that the stories that we hearwith some of the folks who've been victimizeby this, almost Kafkaesque tragedy, was pretty remarkable when we hathem in recently.	N
I want to make sure Virginia continues to be--because we've been hit down in Hampton Roads on this issue.	N
They were saying, ``We're doing the testing, but we still don't have enough money or resources to do it in a timely manner.''	N
Anin effect, these people, who are living in these virtually worthless homes at this point, were basically told, you know, ``We think it's tough, we understanit's challenging, but you've got to continue to live in these places where you coulbe creating a health hazarfor yourself anyour children.''	N
And, Inez, the thing that was most remarkable--afterwards, a series of the families came out antalketo me about the fact that some of the inspectors hastoppegoing in aninspecting in person, aninsteawere simply soliciting the information over the phone, because the inspectors were finding, just coming in anspending an hour or two in the home, they were starting to get some of the ill health effects, in terms of finding shortness of breath anfinding, breaking out another bahealth effects.	N
Anit was just amazing to me that our Federal Government was then saying, ``We don't even want to senour inspectors in to do this, we want to do it over the phone.	N
But, by the way, if you have the misfortune, having done nothing wrong on your own part, to be living in one of these health hazards, we have no recourse for you.''	N
So, from my colleagues, you're hearing other issues of great concern, but this Chinese drywall problem is an enormous, enormous challenge.	N
I hope you will continue to also press to make sure that we can work with you to finrelief for these families.	N
Anif there is legislative solutions that neeto be taken, I know the Chairman has moveaggressively on this issue.	N
I just want to amy voice--we'll be there to do all we can to make sure this issue is brought to full anspeedy resolution.	N
I'm sure you've been briefeon this a little, but if you've got any comments about the Chinese drywall issue, I woullove to hear them.	N
a lot of this is taking place in Louisiana anFlorida--they have different climate issues, in terms of humidity, than folks we've got in Virginia.	N
Anit's remarkable to me that the testing anfinding the cause is taking this long, when it's evident from the families, anthen again even from the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff, that you start to feel the ill effects, literally just being exposefor a few hours.	N
Anas you do the additional testing--anI can just speak from the Virginia standpoint, but I'm sure my other colleagues, who've got other different weather conditions--	N
simply testing it in the Florida- or Louisiana-type humidity issues--we've got humidity in Hampton Roads, but--in Virginia Beach anNorfolk--but, probably not quite as much as they've got in certain areas in Florida--make sure that you've got other States involvein those tests, as well.	N
Mr. Chairman, one thing I'simply add--anI know my time's up, but--anyou hearfrom both of our colleagues from South Carolina--the one thing that Inez is famous about is, when she gets a holof a bone, she doesn't let it go until she figures out an answer.	D
AnI can't think of a better person, on a host of these issues, to take them on in this new, important role, than Inez Tenenbaum.	D
And, third, I hathe privilege of chairing the Georgia Boarof Education in the late 1990s, when you became Superintendent of Education in South Carolina, anI watchewhat you diin South Carolina, anI want to say that everything that Senator DeMint saiwas absolutely correct.	N
You dia marvelous job andemonstratethe kinof attitude somebody at the CPSC shoulhave to deal with the difficult problems.	D
This is--the Chinese drywall situation is one of any number of product problems coming out of China.	N
We obviously can't pass laws that regulate production in China, but we have gateways, which are our ports, anwe have a Commerce Department, anwe have a CPSC.	N
AnI think, somewhere along the line, if you get the chance, a task force of representatives from the ports, HomelanSecurity, the Commerce Department, anthe CPSC, can possibly come up with some ideas of a thresholof entry that coulgive us some degree of protection, or at least sena signal to the worlthat we are looking at the quality of the products that are coming in.

Second, I co-sponsoreSenator DeMint's legislation dealing with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which I votefor, anChairman Pryor spent a lot of time on, but it dihave a lot of unintendeconsequences.	N
One of my daughters-in-law, the mother of three, all under 5, chairs the largest second-hanclothing sale ansecond-hanbook swap in the history of mankind, I think, but it raises a ton of money for their church.	N
When that law passed, within weeks they were calleby their attorneys antolto cancel both those sales because of the potential effect anlegal liability that was put on them as a second-hanseller of a product they neither manufacturenor took any responsibility for.	N
But, I hope you'll apply the same due diligence you diin South Carolina education to that particular subject, antry anget it to where the unintendeconsequences are not so onerous for people, for whom it was never intended.	N
I haquite an experience down there at Representative Clyburn's fish fry that I will never forget, anyou were certainly a gracious host, thank you very much.	N
You anI have talkealready about the toy safety anthe children's product safety bill that was so important to me.	N
But, now I look back on how some of these problems, which I feel very deeply--in my State--we have the two biggest domestic manufacturers of ATVs ansnowmobiles in Minnesota, Polaris anArctic Cat.	N
Anwhen I look back at it I think, one, it woulhave been gooto have haa more collegial relationship with the agency, in terms of working together when these problems came on the scene.	N
Two, as the legislation was drafted, I think it woulhave been helpful to work more proactively with the CPSC.	N
The handmade toy lines actually got its genesis in Minnesota, anyou've already answeresome questions on working with them.	N
We just, this weekend, ha1,600 ATV riders decide to ride in a line to break the Guinness Book of WorlRecords, in Silver Bay, Minnesota, to have the longest line of ATVs--I know you're jealous, Senator Pryor.	N
But, the question that--I specifically have right now, because, of course, this day was much appreciated; I don't think any of the Senators thought that the law was going to be appliethis way.	N
Anthat--again, you're going to be on a judicial body--quasi-judicial--that'll be deciding this.	N
But, what's happeneright now is that, as of July 12, the ATV, snowmobile, anmotorcycle manufacturers have to submit to the CPSC a report that lists each component part that is made of metal anis accessible to children.	N
Because the CPSC is supposeto issue a final rule on accessibility, anwhat's accessible, on August 14.	N
So, there's this lag where they're supposeto give all their parts, but they don't know what's accessible til August 14.	N
Anso, what they're trying to get is some kinof an extension so that they can finout what the CPSC defines as accessible, before they go through these hundreds of parts that they'list.	N
Anjust so you know, the ATV industry strongly supportethis law because it hasome goosafety standards that woulapply to foreign manufacturers that haalready applieto domestic, anthat's the irony of this.	N
They supportethis, anit was interpretein a way that I don't think any Senator, anyone, expected.	N
The Virginia Graham Pool Act is something that I also workeharon, after we haa tragedy in Minnesota with Abigail Taylor.	N
Anthere, with Senator Pryor anothers, we were able to get that done a few months after this tragedy happened.	N
AnI just wanteto just say to you, we know the CPSC can't enforce it on every little pool all over the country, every public pool, but we also know that the education efforts will be very important here.	N
Because we've found, in our State, we have hano incidents since this happened, because, of course, it hit people's hearts so much, so the pool operators are all going out anmaking sure things are in better shape.	N
There are serious health symptoms, anyet people don't know exactly what the health bottom line is.	N
Also, there's major damage to the home, such as corrosion of piping anwiring, which brings up fundamental safety issues with gas lines anthe like.	N
In Louisiana, it's sort of triply tragic because, by definition, these are folks who were floodeby one of our hurricanes, Katrina or Rita or Gustav or Ike.	N
So, by definition, virtually every one of those folks were harhit by a hurricane or just recovering anhave finally put their house back together, anthen they discover this, anthey have to start all over, antheir house is a loss, sometimes a complete loss, yet again.	N
I'm certainly continuing to work with Senator Nelson, Senator Landrieu, anmany others, on legislation anon funding, which has the CPSC studying this issue on a more acceleratetimetable, to study three things in particular.	N
Number one, the relationship between the drywall anhealth symptoms; so, what's the bottom line on health, number one.	N
Even with these funding assurances, even with a study ongoing, the woris it's taking months anmonths.	N
What can you tell us about the current plan at CPSC with regarto the timing of this study?	N
Well, my understanding is that, even with everything that's been done, anfunding commitments for CPSC to focus on this immediately, it's going to be a matter of many, many months, which strikes me as really frustrating aninadequate.	N
I appreciate that, anI look forwarto following up with regarto that specific timetable, because right now, it's on a very frustrating multi-month timetable.	N
What are your thoughts about focusing on this Chinese pattern, to really get some significant new results across the board?	N
And, Ms. Tenenbaum, you can give the answer for the record, because I don't want to holeverything up.	N
I strongly believe that one of the problems is that in the past there has not been enough common work ancoordination among multiple involveagencies, like the International Trade Commission, Customs, USTR, anyour soon-to-be agency, working together for a practical result.	N
For instance, in this Chinese drywall situation, at the enof the day, if the only action is some sort of class-action suit against some shell entity in China, which is really some arm of the Chinese government, that goes into litigation antakes years anyears more, that's not a solution.	N
Really, what has to happen is for this to be a priority of the U.S. Government, including USTR, CPSC, aneverybody who deals regularly with China, to get a practical resolution, anhave the victims reimbursein a whole ana quick way.	N
AnI just ask, for the record, your responses to that idea, anhow woulyou work towarthat sort of practical, bottom-line result.	N
I was wondering if I coulask you about emerging products that are associatewith hazards.	N
In 2007, the Commission establishea pilot program for an early-warning system on emerging products anassociatehazards.	N
Anmy understanding is that that system uses subject-matter experts anelectronic assessment tools to allow the Commission staff to quickly identify these issues anpropose corrective action.	N
I guess that's what I was getting at, is whether, in principle, that approach helps the Commission to be more proactive than completely reactive.	N
Anshoulthe Commission be proactive when it comes to emerging safety issues in consumer products?	N
Several of the unforeseen issues the Commission has hato address in implementing the Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvement Act involve smaller businesses, and--do you think the Commission is well positionefor conducting outreach to smaller consumer product manufacturers?	N
I know the Commission leverages its staff by using standards committees anorganizations, like the Underwriters Lab anANSI.	N
But does the Commission also leverage its relationship with the Small Business Administration another agencies within the Department of Commerce, like NIST anthe Manufacturing Extension Partnership?	N
I know--I understaninteresteparties can submit petitions to the Commission that can ultimately leato rulemaking.	N
Ando you have any sense, or any thoughts, on that, the amount of time that it takes or how the Commission does that as it initiates its own rulemaking?	N
Anare there some of these things that are just going to get delayeanyway because of the level of staffing?	N
Well, thank you, Ms. Tenenbaum, I appreciate your answers, anI appreciateour meeting anyour past experience at the State level.	N
I think your nomination is such a wonderful development for this very, very important anneglectepart of our government.	N
The tenacity you have shown in your career, anyour willingness to take on projects against the odds suits you very well for the challenge that you've accepted.	D
AnI hope that--I'm sure many of your visits in front of this Committee will not be as pleasant as the one today----	N
I will say that it's very important--anI know you've discussethis in other questioning, anI know that your answers have been exactly what I was looking for--but I think the problem we've got with the legislation that we passeis the confusion anuncertainty.	N
Anyou combine that with a failure to embrace the notion of common sense, anour phones ring off the hook.	N
And--I mean, when I've got women that I revere that are librarians crying on the phone to me, I know that something is amiss, because I don't think government shoulever make librarians cry.	N
So, I want to make sure that I convey to you how much I hope your common sense takes firm control of this situation, anthat we quickly move towarvery clear guidance, so that if there are any remaining issues that we neeto go back antake a look at, that we can do so.	N
Let me give you an opportunity to speak to that just briefly, if you would, Ms. Tenenbaum.	N
AnI--on behalf of the librarians, anthe great thrift-store operators, anthe wonderful folks that hunt, with their ATVs, in Missouri, I thank you for that.	N
Let me, if I may--our vote is on, anlet me just have a couple of follow-up questions, if I can, or follow-up observations.	N
One of the things Senator Lautenberg talkeabout was, he hawritten a letter to the CPSC, anhe never receivea response.	N
I don't know if this is true, but anecdotally I've heard, anI hope it's not true, that there was favoritism shown to Republican inquiries, as opposeto Democratic inquiries, anI certainly hope that wasn't the case.	N
But I wouldefinitely hope that, as long as you're Chairman, you'll be very politically neutral when it comes to communicating with House, Senate, Attorney Generals, Governors, whatever the case may be.	N
The Chinese drywall case is an illustration of how much easier it is to fix the problem before it comes into the UniteStates.	N
Annow, with that Chinese drywall--that is in houses, it's ruining houses, anit has ruinetheir value.	N
If we coulhave gone back a few years in time, anif we haan inspector there, if we haan office there--you mentionethat--if we hasomeone there to say, ``No, that cannot come in to the U.S.,'' just think about how many millions anmillions of dollars people arounthe country woulhave saved.	N
Another thing I want to say before I close is, I think, when we talk about librarians anATVs another matters that we've talkeabout today, thrift stores, et cetera--I think that what's happened--what you can see is, is--when the agency runs properly, it can help resolve these issues before the industry gets to a chaos point.	N
But, I think, in the last few months, what you've seen is, with some actions of the agency or individuals there, or whatever the case may be, statements made by them, you saw almost a panic in a lot of sectors of our economy, with people not knowing what to do.	N
So, I think that dose of common sense that people have talkeabout, anthat spirit of cooperation, anworking together to resolve this anget to a resolution that's goofor everybody, I think that'll be a great breath of fresh air.	N
Anthat is, the Chairman, who is Senator Rockefeller, anSenator Hutchison, the Ranking Member, have askeall Senators to get their questions for the recorin today by 6 p.m.	N
That's goonews for you, because that means what they are hoping is, we'll be able to move this nomination quicker.	N
And, Ms. Tenenbaum, we really, really appreciate your interest in public service, anyour willingness to take on this Commission.	D
Anwe look forwarto working with you as you're the Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	N
Mr. Chairman, I do have an opening statement, but I woulbe happy to let Senator Schumer introduce the nominee.	N
First, I want to thank you, Ranking Member, all the members for giving me the honor to introduce Julius Genachowski, one of my former staffers angoofriends, before he is confirmeto be Chairman of the FCC.	N
In fact, after his New York upbringing, he went to college anthen I hirehim right out of college, anhe workefor me long anhard.	D
I have been blessewith a dedicateanhard-working staff, but Julius will always stanout, thanks in large part to the work ethic that his family instillein him.	N
His parents, Azriel anAdele, are in the audience today, anI have hathe pleasure of knowing them.	D
They can speak volumes about the adoration they have for Julius anhis brothers, Joey anAlan, who are also here.	N
AnI woullike to say hello to his wife, Rachel, anhis three beautiful children, Jake, Aaron, anLilah.	N
I remember that Julius demonstratea passion for consumer rights from the day he came to Congress.	D
Anone of his signature issues was working on what is now callethe Schumer Box, which is what is on all credit carapplications.	D
It shoulhave been callethe Genachowski Box, but his name was too long, so they put mine in.	N
AnI know he is going to carry that dedication to consumer rights to his role as FCC Chairman, shoulhe be confirmeby this Committee anby the Senate.	N
In addition to working for me, he serveon the House Select Committee on the Iran-Contra affair.	D
Of course, he has haextensive knowledge of the FCC, where he workeas special counsel to General Counsel William Kennard, who later became Chairman anthen to Chairman ReeHundt.	D
The FCC has been a passion for Julius for a very long time, anit is so nice to see him nominatefor the position he knows so well ancares so much about.	D
His resume in the public sector demonstrates a widespreaknowledge of agency experience, anit gives him a well-roundebackgrounon all the issues that are before the FCC.	D
Anhe has a great deal that he could--he is a modest fellow, but he coulboast about his private sector work, which demonstrates his understanding of where the Government rubber hits the tech company roaanhow those two entities must work together to shape the future of telecommunications.	D
He was a special advisor for General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm, anmost recently, he co-foundeboth LaunchBox Digital anRock Creek Ventures, which helpeto advise, launch, anaccelerate tech companies in their early stages.	D
So Julius is creative, knowledgeable, anrespected, probably as creative, knowledgeable, anrespectea nominee that the FCC has ever seen.	D
He knows that telecommunications in an economy that is fundamentally baseon interconnectivity is instrumental to job creation anentrepreneurship in the U.S.	D
The President knows that Julius has the ability to harness telecommunication technology, to shape our country's initiatives from health care to education to energy, anthat is why he chose Julius to serve as Chairman of the Technology, Media anTelecommunications Policy Working Group that createthe Obama technology aninnovation plan.	D
So I coulnot think of a more well-preparenominee, someone who cares more about the agency, someone who has more qualities that will make him live up to the strong anappropriately high challenges that you, Mr. Chairman anRanking Member Hutchison, have laibefore him.	D
I am very pleased, after meeting with him anjust his focus on what he wants to do with the agency.	D
One of my pet peeves is while the agency's website was at one point a really groundbreaking website, I think it has kinof fallen behinana lot of people complain about access on the website.	N
I was telling him outside that the DTV transition is going, at least in my State--I will not speak for everyone--better than we thought, anthat the FCC Commissioner McDowell anI talkeabout this on Friday, anthe Commerce Department have worketogether on this.	N
Then, of course, just as the other Senators spoke about, the broadbanissue is very important to me.	N
The last thing that we spoke about briefly was something that Senator Warner anI have introducelegislation--anwe hope other members of the Committee will look at it--calleDig Once.	N
It is the simple idea that if you are going to be building a Federal highway, a Federal roaproject, anyou want to put in conduit for broadband--anwe know we want to do this all over the country--that you shoulbe doing it at the same time.	N
Literally something like 90 percent of the cost of broadbaninstallation is that of roadwork, anyou can literally save about 10 times the cost if you simply do it at the same time.	N
It certainly was popular in my State yesterday when they were dealing with the roaconstruction season in Minnesota with all of the orange cones, delays anclosehighways.	N
We are very excitefor your new leadership at the FCC, anwe are exciteto be working with you.	D
I will just submit my opening statement for the record, but I want to welcome Mr. Genachowski to the Committee.	N
It is gooto see you up there, see you vibrant anstrong, anwe very much appreciate your leadership on this Committee.	D
I woullike to echo also what the Ranking Member, Senator Hutchison, saiabout broadband, anI think Senator Klobuchar anMr. Genachowski also mentioneit.	N
If we look at the various points in our history where we were not connected, with the railroads in the 1880s, we made a major investment, anwe encouragerailroads to serve the entire country.	N
Then with FDR in the 1930s an1940s, we realizewe were not connectein terms of electricity, anwe brought electricity to rural areas with rural electric co-ops.	N
AnI applauSenator Warner anSenator Klobuchar for their bill in thinking through how we put this in.	N
One of the areas I woullike you to think about anaddress in your opening statement is Indian Country.	N
I remember when President Clinton was trying to demonstrate the digital divide, anI think I tolthis to you in our meeting.	N
Anhe usethat trip from the Silicon Valley to Shiprock, New Mexico out on the Navajo Reservation to show the huge digital divide.	N
So I hope that your leadership there will move us down the road, anthis Committee will also step up to the plate.	D
I cannot be here for long today because of some other commitments, but I diwant to stop by anoffer a few thoughts.	N
First of all, Mr. Genachowski, we have not haan opportunity really to meet or to talk at any length.	N
But I have to tell you, looking at your backgrounanyour resume, two things come to mind.	D
You have prepareyourself well for what you are about to get yourself into, which is a job with huge responsibility.	D
Second, it just occurs to me if you are not qualifiefor this, I do not know who woulbe qualified.	D
So I really wish you the very, very best anlook forwarto working with you on a whole range of issues.	N
So many goothings have been mentioned, anI do not want to repeat them other than to indicate that yes, of course, for me issues like broadband, broadbanin rural areas, ansparsely populateareas, woulof course be important.	N
Second, whether we hear about it today--or maybe sometime you can stop by the office--I woullove to visit with you about the community advisory boards.	N
There is some concern that, you know, if a local broadcaster does not know the community, who coulpossibly know the community?	N
I woulalso like to hear some thoughts at some point about economic growth in rural areas.	N
I do think the Commission is uniquely situateto help us in more rural States, anmaybe it is broadband.	N
Maybe there are some other things that we can do together to try to boost economic activity.	N
I always saias a Governor anas a former Mayor, creating a job in Omaha is vastly different than creating a job in a community of 2,000 people that is in a very rural part of the State.	N
The seconthing, just to wrap up, Mr. Chairman, I do also want to put in a very strong endorsement for someone who I hope will be your future colleague, anthat is, Commissioner McDowell, who will follow you.	N
I think you can create a bonana working relationship that kinof extends across the aisle, like many of us do on this Committee.	N
Looking at your resume, knowing him better than I actually know you at this point, I just think there is a tremendous amount of brain power that, put to work, can really help our great Nation.	D
Having sat in your seat at one point in my career, I just want to say congratulations, anI woulsay the same thing to Commissioner McDowell.	N
When we saw what recently happened, the Federal Communications Commission facea major test when they movethe entire country from analog to digital.	N
This move promises better programming anpicture ansounquality for our residents anbusinesses, anit will free up space for wireless broadbananpublic safety needs.	N
Despite a slow start ana few delays, I am pleasewith how successful the transition was, anI look forwarto the benefits that it will bring to those residents of New Jersey who habeen, in previous years, out of the quality of transmission.	N
Commissioner McDowell, as well as Acting Chairman Copps, anCommissioner Adelstein, deserves credit for making the transition work.	N
If you are confirmed--anthere is little doubt in my mind--anRobert McDowell is confirmed, we expect them to continue the commitment anthe leadership that we have seen.	D
We hearfrom Chuck Schumer about your past experience, anwe know that he was very impressewith the kinof work that you diantakes total credit for whatever developments you have had.	D
If these nominees, you anMr. McDowell, are confirmed, you are going to still have some very critical tasks that have to get attention.	D
We neea plan for a public safety broadbannetwork using some airwaves that were freeup by the switch to digital.	N
New Jersey's only commercial high-powerestation, WWOR, has faileto meet its obligation of our State.	N
So we are going to talk to you about that, anI am not sure that we are going to have the time to ask questions anstill meet other obligations in my case.	N
The FCC is drafting a national broadbanplan, getting broadbanin underservecommunities, not just the underserverural ones.	N
It is essential that we continue to help people continue to learn, get newer, better jobs, ankeep America competitive.	N
AnI look forwarto our contact in the future, knowing that we have an able skipper at the helm.	N
Commissioner McDowell, of course, is nominatefor a seconterm, anI am pleaseto support him.	D
I think, Mr. Genachowski, you have a perfect backgrounto assume the chairmanship, anI will be happy to vote for you.	D
Let me say, however, that it seems to me you will leaa rather unhealthy agency, anby that, I mean we have been through a perioof substantial secrecy, I believe a very difficult work environment anwith questions about unbiasepolicy research studies.	N
Some of them perhaps do not match someone's impression of what shoulhave come out of the studies, so they were not released.	N
Commissioner Copps has, I think, done a fine job in an acting capacity, but we neemore transparency, more openness, in policy development.	D
You are going to have to develop a national broadbanplan, which is a big, big issue anhas so many important considerations.	N
Policies on spectrum, what spectrum out there lies fallow, why, how much of it, why is it not used, what can we do about that, the faileprogram on forbearance petitions, net neutrality--which by the way, you can solve yourself.	N
We have an active anaggressive debate here in the Congress on net neutrality, but you coulactually remove that burden by taking a very significant step in solving that issue anrestoring net neutrality provisions.	N
Anthen there's the issue of public interest obligations ansubstantial concentration of broadcast properties arounthe country, anthe fact that many of us think that concentration has been very unhealthy.	N
Again, I am pleasewhen we have nominees come before us who are extraordinarily well qualified.	D
I think that is the case with you, anI am pleaseto support your nomination anCommissioner McDowell's as well.	N
I actually hathe opportunity to get to know him many, many years ago when we useto play basketball at the YMCA here in town together.	D
Then he stoppeplaying with me anhe starteplaying with this other guy who now lives down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.	D
He has got a pretty mean jump shot anis someone that I know has a deep friendship with the President.	D
As somebody who at least useto know a little something about telecom, I do think we have a chance--anI also will be supporting Commissioner McDowell.	N
I hope to come back anto be able to introduce my fellow Virginian, somebody I am prouto support.	D
But I do think there is a chance to kinof reestablish the stature anprominence of the FCC.	N
It is a terribly important agency that has a critically important scope of work, anI look forwarto working with you.	N
With Senator Klobuchar--her bill is on trying to make sure we think smartly about how we deploy the fiber.	N
But it is also important that we think clearly about making sure that we have got an accurate mapping of broadbancapabilities arounthe country, that we really think creatively about last-mile concerns.	N
Broadband, as you know, does no gooif you can bring it to a town hall, but you do not have any ability to get it out arounthe balance of the community.	N
I think we really neeto be creative about how we put incentives in place anhelp smaller communities, in particular, aggregate demanso they can have a sustainable broadbannetwork, even if the public sector makes the initial investment.	N
We are quite successful on the D block auctions on the 700 MHz space, but trying to make sure that we have that next-generation public safety spectrum that is fully interoperable is, candidly, I think still an embarrassment in this country that this many years after 9/11, we do not have that fully interoperable, full-functioning public safety spectrum across the whole country.	N
It is going to be right on your menu anmaking sure, again, as we do this analysis of what spectrum exists out there anhow we make sure we get it out to the public and, perhaps at the same time, generate some revenue.	N
Again, I have to step away for a minute, but I do hope to get back to introduce my fellow Virginian, Robert McDowell, who I know will continue to be a great Commissioner ana great partner, I think, with Julius in getting the FCC back on track.	N
Thank you for the time that you came anmet with me anyour commitment to consider coming to Alaska again ansee what we are doing up there.	N
But again, thank you for being here anto your family that I know needs to support you in this endeavor, as you will be drawn across the country at times to present, discuss, anhave issues brought to your attention that will require you to leave Washington, D.C. at times.	N
So, again, thank you for your willingness to do this, anagain, thank you for the time that we spent together going over very Alaskan-type issues.	N
I was going to slap you on the thigh anwelcome you back, but I dinot know which leg it was, so I dinot.	N
Mr. McDowell, I want to congratulate you on your seconnomination to serve on the Commission, anI look forwarto supporting you also.	N
We have haa chance to chat, anI think you know I support you, but I want to express it publicly.	N
I think you are the right person to leathis Commission at a time of great economic uncertainty, anthe experience that you bring from your previous tenure at the Commission, as well as your own private-sector experience, is just the right recipe for the Commission during these difficult times.	D
The FCC regulates, as you know, an industry that makes up roughly one-fifth of the U.S. economy, anI regret to say that the tenure anstewardship, if you can call it that, of your predecessor really, I thought, was a bleak period, a difficult periofor all of us at the FCC.	N
I think it is a trail of misseopportunities, of acts of commission anomission that wounup just not taking advantage of the revolution in the communications worlanthe neeto come up with some fundamental policies, not the least of which is just the broadbanpenetration of our Nation which slippefrom something like 4th to 21st.	N
That is not a positive statement about competitiveness or America's preparedness to step up.	N
You are going to have an enormous influence on industries that we rely upon to serve as dynamic drivers for the future of our economy, anwe are going to look to you for that leadership.	N
I am confident from what you have saialready anfrom your past that you understanthat challenge.	N
Obviously, this hearing comes at a time of great transformation in the way that we are communicating with each other in this country.	N
Just 4 days ago, broadcast television stations completethe digital transition, shutting off analog signals that have delivereair broadcast television to households for more than 60 years.	N
That transition dia lot more than just bring a clearer TV picture into those rooms where people got their box angot ready for it.	N
But thanks to the digital switch, next-generation wireless broadbannetworks are being built across the country anconsumers are going to reap the benefits of that.	N
So when confirmed, you are going to begin to craft the FCC's national broadbanplan, anthat I think is perhaps the most important task you are going to face as Chairman, given the way we have gone backwaranthe level of the challenge.	N
As part of that process, I hope you are going to consider taking a look at the way we manage anallocate spectrum, both publicly anprivately, in order to see that we use it more efficiently.	N
I have introducelegislation with Senator Snowe anothers on this Committee to require the Commission to work with NTIA on a comprehensive spectrum inventory, anI think that such an effort woulplay an integral role in any plan for achieving universal broadbanservice.	N
There is obviously no shortage of challenges waiting for you as you enter the Chairman's office.	N
The quarterly contribution rate to the Universal Service Funis as high as it has ever been.	N
Annearly 8 years after 9/11, shockingly we still have not made gooon the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to builan interoperable public safety communications network.	N
So, from addressing these challenges anothers, to maintaining the openness of the Internet, which many of us, I think you know, care about passionately, as well as maintaining a laboratory for innovation, I think you are going to see some of the biggest challenges that we have facein this field, but I am confident that this Commission is up to the task of implementing the President's technology agenda.	N
So we look forwarto a swift confirmation anwe particularly look forwarto working closely with you.	N
We hope that you will commit in the hearings to a strong, candid, anreally cooperative relationship with the Committee.	N
For those of you who may be trying to figure out how to pronounce his name, we have haresearchers at work for 3 days on that anit is pronounce``chow'' not ``cowski.''	N
Senator Hutchison, I have great respect for the leadership you bring to the Committee, anI look forwarto working with you on the vital issues in the communications area.	D
I woullike to thank Senator Schumer for taking the time to introduce me anfor his decision 24 years ago to give a young college graduate his first job.	N
Senator Hutchison, I have great respect for the leadership you bring to the Committee, anI look forwarto the opportunity to work with you on the important issues in this area.	D
I'like to thank Senator Schumer for introducing me today--anfor his decision 24 years ago to give a young college graduate his first job.	N
Senator Schumer sets a high bar for public service, anI am honoreto call him a mentor ana friend.	N
I coulnot be more grateful for the love ansupport of my wonderful wife, Rachel Goslins, anmy incredible children--Jake, Lilah, anAaron.	N
I'm so pleasethat my parents are here, Adele anAzriel Genachowski, anmy two brothers, Joey anAlan Genachowski.	N
On the broadbanissue, how do you view the issue of no service versus underserveareas as priorities?	N
I just hope that the priority is to help people who have nothing with our stimulus money is really what we are discussing here.	N
But people who have nothing, it seems to me, shoultake priority over people who have slower service.	N
How do you see that evolving anis it a priority that indecency enforcement policies woulbe lookeat?	N
When I first came to the Senate, I was a person who believethat a newspaper shoulnot have too much television presence in a market because I think more media outlets are a goothing.	N
Since I came to the Senate, the technology worlhas exploded, anI no longer think that we neeto police that.	N
Annow we have the most incredible situation, which I do not think any of us ever anticipatein our lifetimes, that major newspapers woulbe on the brink of literally going out of business, annot having that avenue for news coverage for the citizens of big communities is now a viable possibility.	N
So my question is the FCC does still have rules against dual ownership, anI think it is important that you look at that andetermine if really we ought to be doing everything we can to keep newspapers alive in order to have the most outlets for people who like to get their news in different ways.	N
But I woulhope you woulset it at a higher priority than just waiting for a review perioto come up.	N
But I woullike to ask you: Do you think it is a goopublic policy to encourage more minority ownership of broadcast media?	N
Do you have any ideas on what we can do, meaning the FCC or the Congress or whoever, to try to make ownership of broadcast outlets more possible for minority interests?	N
I just think that the public policy goal of a more diverse ownership spectrum is a goonational goal that we shoulcontinue to try to do.	N
This morning, this Committee haa hearing on Inez Tenenbaum over at the Consumer Product Safety Commission in her confirmation process.	N
She hasome really gooideas about how the CPSC can better communicate dangers anrecalls ansafety anall this stuff to the general public.	D
But one thing that struck me is most of her ideas--not all, most of them--dealt with people having broadbancapability so they coulreceive this type of information from the CPSC.	N
I woullike to ask you about the BTOP, the BroadbanTechnology Opportunity Program, in the stimulus package.	N
Do you know much about that, ando you have a sense of how that is going to be administered?	N
AnI know you are not there yet, but is your understanding that the FCC is involvein that process?	N
Are you happy with what you hear on that, or do you think the FCC shoulbe more involved?	N
Ando you think that program is going to actually get to unserveareas, as Senator Hutchison was referring to?	N
Last, I woullike to ask you about something that is important to you as a parent anme as a parent anothers in this room as parents angrandparents.	N
Basically when the V-chip bill passeway back when in, I think, 1996, if I am not mistaken, there was a requirement that the FCC woulcontinue to look at technology ansee if this idea coulbe improveupon.	N
This Act that we passerecently in the last year or 2 basically mandatethat the FCC open a case on it.	N
I understanyou are in a comment perioright now, maybe even a seconrounof a comment period.	N
My question for you is, given your backgrounanall the things that you have done, do you think it is time that we revisit V-chip annot just the technology but the V-chip system that is in place?	D
As Senator Pryor just talkeabout, I also will be very interestein how you proceeanfor the same reasons, as someone who has a young child.	N
If it was not on--I will not publicize one channel, but I will say PBS was the other channel.	N
If it is not on those two, I have no clue what is on the regular shows, unless it is a newscast.	N
Let me, if I can--anyou anI talkebriefly about this in the Universal Service Funanhow important that is at least for our State, a very rural State and, I like to describe here in this committee, ``extreme rural,'' as other people talk about rural States.	N
The distance, anthe travel, anthe complexity of transportation to these locations, but also the climate conditions, really create some unique situations.	N
As that moves forward, there will be issues of concern for us as Alaska is identified, if I am not mistaken--it is 100 percent tribal, which gives it some special considerations.	N
I am curious on how you feel about that policy anhow tribal lanis recognizeanhow Alaska fits into that.	N
You don't have to be specific, but specifically about that anthe reform itself of the USF.	N
Analso in Alaska, because our lands are different with the Alaska Native people, there are tribal lands ancorporate tribal lands.	N
So sometimes, we have to continue to point that out because our lanclaim settlement was much different than the traditional reservation settlements.	N
So as you have an opportunity--I know I saiin my statement--I dinot give you a chance.	N
AnI just want to echo that because this will give you a chance to see the value of that program.	N
Currently, they are concernethat they will be excludefrom the national broadbanplan.	N
In Alaska, because the cost anutilization of satellite is part of the equation, how do you see that, anwill you in the broadbanplan keep that all in consideration that in Alaska satellites are utilizein a lot of ways to get that more costly connection that may not be able to be done by land?	N
Excellent, because I can tell you they are very concerned, just because, again, the vast distances, the uniqueness of the lack of access to infrastructure, satellites become part of the equation of how we deliver broadband.	N
The goonews is, in Alaska, 70-plus percent--we are the highest connecteState in the country, which is kinof unusual in its own way anit is because of this kinof relationship we have with satellite, as well as on the ground.	N
Again, for us it is more of a statement just for the record, as our discussion occurreprivately, anthat is the importance of E-Rate anhow we deliver.	N
When we have the No ChilLeft BehinAct that says you must have a certain type of teacher with certain credentials teaching kids at certain levels, in some schools, we may only have 10-15 people anto have all that specialty is impossible.	N
I just want to reemphasize the importance of that but also hear your support again on the recorof how important E-Rate is, as well as the impact it may have especially in rural communities.	N
I know you have been a big proponent in a lot of ways of Alaska issues because you have seen it.	N
Another area is white spaces, opening up broadcast white spaces to fixewireless anpersonal portable devices.	N
I know the Commission took a very conservative start in opening up the white space, but it was a start.	N
Will the Office of Engineering Technology make sure that this is a priority issue so that we can have sufficient resources in working with the industry to test anmake sure that we are answering any of the technical issues that might come up?	N
If there is a competitive market for broadbanservice where consumers coulpurchase broadbanfrom multiple independent providers, woulthe discussion over the net neutrality change?	N
I mean, the concern, obviously, is not to artificially segment off parts of the population angiving them a higher cost.	N
We talkein my office about the so-calleFairness Doctrine, anas I understooit, you saithat you do not support reviving it or policies like it directly or indirectly through localism anthat sort of thing.	N
I just wanteto have for the recorthat I am correct in stating your position, or if you woullike to restate it.	N
The good, when we haour bridge collapse anarea right in the metropolitan area hadone a very goojob of interoperability because of our sheriff anothers, anthen I have seen difficulties in the past anin some of our rural areas with that.	N
It seems to me that is just one of the areas of our Nation's information infrastructure that may continue to elude us, absent some Federal action anFederal involvement in terms of making our emergency services more interoperable.	N
Yes, we haa horrible shooting of a police officer once, before we got better communications in our metropolitan area.	N
Literally, the emergency personnel haseven different phone services anwalkie-talkies antrying to talk to each other while they were pursuing a suspect who hakillethis cop.	N
I just came from a Judiciary hearing on competition in the wireless market in text messaging anthings like that.	N
Senator Rockefeller anI anothers have a bill that we will most likely introduce in some form this year about cell phone competition.	N
In my view, this has come a long way from the days when the movie Wall Street anGordon Gekko haa cell phone the size of a briefcase, anwe now have 270 million Americans--18 percent of Americans--do not even have a lanline.	N
Anyet, while there have been some vast improvements with early termination fees and, having driven arounmy State this weekend, there are still huge problems with droppecalls anconsumer knowledge about what they are buying anif it really works in the areas that they want to drive to or work in.	N
The complaint right now--anthis is why we hathis hearing--is just concerns about some of the prices right now.	N
You anI talkeabout this anhow it useto be this model of development aninnovation, annow it is lagging behind.	N
Now, of course, the question I really wanteto ask when Senator Schumer was here anwe coulpretenyou were under oath--we couldo this whole thing--was when he saithat the credit carbox that he--	N
But I chose not to do that, anbecause we have hasuch a nice ana positive hearing, we will not enthat way.	N
Mr. Genachowski, thank you very, very much for your time here today anfor making yourself available.	N
I know you visitewith many of us, if not all of us, privately in our offices, anwe appreciate that.	N
I also think something that others have alludeto is very true, anthat is, this agency is extremely important anwill really benefit from your leadership anyour management style there.	D
If you guys woullike to stay, you can, but if you woullike to leave, that is completely up to you.	N
We are asking all the Senators who have follow-up questions to get those to us by 6 p.m. today.	N
Anthat is a goosign for you because that means we are going to try to expedite your confirmation as much as possible.	N
So thank you very much for your time, anI am going to call up the seconpanel, if the Committee does not have anything else.	N
As he is departing the table there, as Mr. McDowell is coming forwarwith his family, there is going to be a little bit of a change here.	N
Thank you, anI want to thank everybody for trying to do such a quick change there because we haa lot of people that hato come ango.	N
I must say that I hear very, very positive reviews on the things you have done there at the FCC, anI think you have been a very positive force there.	N
If you want to introduce your family anmake your opening statement, that woulbe great.	N
Senator Pryor anSenator Hutchison another Members of the Committee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.	N
Senator Smith was not able to be here, but he sent a question anaskeme to put it to you.	N
His question is this: ``For those of us in Oregon have been trying to attract a baseball team for years, we're envious of the spans (ph) in cities that actually have a team.	N
``I am, however, becoming more concerneabout a tactic that cable companies are using to limit viewership of local sports programming.	N
First Cablevision stoppebroadcasting of Yankee games until they got a deal they wanteanthen Comcast dithe same diwith the Philadelphia Phillies anin Washington, D.C., with the Nationals.''	N
This is Senator Smith's question, ``I understanthe business negotiations can be tough, but blocking game broadcasts raise real concerns.	N
Coming from the private sector, I will first look to private-sector solutions to resolve issues such as that anI woulprefer to see voluntary agreements between the parties at hand.	N
There may be ongoing proceedings or future proceedings at the Commission that coulexamine this.	N
I'm not exactly sure of the Commission's authority in those areas under Title VI, Section 628, for instance.	N
If the Commission can encourage a private-sector solution, I woullook for such an avenue.	N
As I mentioned, we welcome Commissioner Adelstein to be with us today, but if you are already confirmeyou both couldn't be here.	N
Are you familiar with some of the rules that have been adoptein the past concerning the activities of the Commission?	N
Are you familiar with that rule, particularly about how many Commissioners can be present at any one time at a public gathering?	N
I think we neesome opinions on the Commission about what shoulbe done to modernize your procedures so that you can function as a modern body.	N
There was a time in the past when Senator Goldwater anI decidethat there were too many Commissioners anwe askethe Congress to delete two.	N
Well, Senator, throughout my career I've learnethat these issues are not necessarily, for the most part, partisan issues.	N
I have workein a bipartisan manner as an advocate, anwoulcontinue to take that spirit to the Commission with me if confirmed.	N
I've serveon statutory boards appointeby two Governors of Virginia that were bipartisan anworkewell with folks of the other party, again, on issues that are historically not necessarily been partisan issues, for the most part.	N
You've haa substantial relationship with some of the communications interests anI note in your statement that you indicate that you do intento very jealously apply the conflict of interest concepts anwill disqualify yourself in any matter than you've haconnection with before or any entity you've habefore.	N
Well, I will certainly rely on the opinion of the Office of the General Counsel of the FCC anthey do have a system in place anrules in place.	N
We have a Commissioner recently who came from the private sector, from a regulatecompany, who endeup only being recusefrom two particular matters, as I recall.	N
So I will consult with the Office of General Counsel on any matter where Comptel may have been a party or where Comptel's members may have been a party to make sure that there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interest.	N
My primary bailiwick at Comptel for the past 6 or 7 years has been the legislative anexecutive branch.	N
Anmy name has not appeareon a pleading in several years, nor have I been formulating or writing pleadings or been substantially involvein any pleadings before the Commission.	N
If they do, I woulurge you to responto them as rapidly as possible because we will also try to get this nomination on the Executive Session agenda for March 16.	N
What I will do now is turn it over to Senator Hutchison who has an appointment that she needs to get to.	N
Tonight I am going to be watching the University of Texas Longhorns in the college worlseries, anI am asking you right now to consider going to the University of Texas anplaying baseball because I know you have a future.	N
I woullike to ask you the same question that I also poseto Mr. Genachowski regarding the media ownership rule, the newspaper, broadcast, television station, FCC parameters, anask if you think that it is time to look at those restrictions in a new light.	N
I saiearlier that I have never likehaving too much ownership in too few media outlets.	N
I do not think it is healthy, but so much has changein the last five years, as you statein your opening statement, anI think perhaps now with newspapers in such dire straits, that lifting some of those restrictions anletting broadcast annewspaper owners have the capability to bring their revenue up so that they can both stay in business.	N
We haan ArmeServices Subcommittee hearing on which I am the Ranking Member, but I am glato be able to welcome ancongratulate Mr. McDowell on your reappointment.	N
I look forwarto continuing to work with you upon your confirmation on a lot of issues, obviously, many of which have been toucheon.	N
National broadbanpolicy, applying indecency regulations--net neutrality has been mentioned--spectrum allocation are just a few of the issues that confront the Commission today.	N
I think the range of issues that you deal with, the importance of those issues cannot be overstated.	N
So it is a very important position, anI hope that we can continue to make some progress on some of these things.	N
I woulsay anI understanthat you have already haa lot of, I am sure, very lively discussion about the fairness doctrine, but I hope the Commission can put a stake through the heart of that thing once anfor all.	N
It will certainly reduce the number of amendments that we consider up here if we do not have to deal with the fairness doctrine amendments on appropriations bills.	N
But I do want to ask you about some of the national broadbanpolicies because as you know, the FCC is requireby the stimulus bill to develop a national broadbanplan.	N
I know that there are grants anloan guarantees in the stimulus bill, but I am just curious as to what your thoughts are about deploying broadbanto rural areas of the country.	N
Well, anI know that the Universal Service Funtends to generate a considerable amount of controversy.	N
The only thing I guess I woulask of you is, as you take these issues on, that you take into consideration the impact on rural areas anmaking sure that rural areas anthe frontier, so to speak, is not left behind.	N
I think there are just some wonderful applications of technology that are leading to incredible increases in productivity anjob creation aneverything else in our economy, but it is, obviously, going to be very important in my view as we move forward, that we do it in a way that takes into consideration some of the unique anparticular needs that rural areas of the country have as well.	N
I want to congratulate Mr. McDowell, anas I saibefore, I look forwarto working with you.	N
It is one of the things that the Chairman is very prouof because of its effectiveness in closing the digital divide.	N
When the Telecom Act of 1996 was passed, only 14 percent of the classrooms in the country an5 percent of the classrooms in low-income communities haaccess to the Internet.	N
Thanks to the E-Rate program, today more than 90 percent of all classrooms have access to the Internet.	N
The question woulbe, do you support the E-Rate program as it is currently laiout in the statute?	N
Ando you think that there shoulbe any modifications, either changes or enhancements, to it, or do you think it ought to just stay as is?	N
Speaking of mergers anacquisitions, I know that is one of the things that the FCC does that is very important.	N
When you look at a merger or acquisition in a given industry, there coulliterally be billions of dollars at stake anthere is a lot of capital investment, anyou neeto consider that aspect of it.	N
You also neeto, obviously, look at the consumer anwhether the consumer will benefit, but you also, I think, at least shoullook at the economic impact it will have on given communities because oftentimes when there is a merger or acquisition, one community is a big loser in that prospect.	N
So my question is just a general question, anthat is, how do you balance all of those interests when you are looking at a merger or acquisition?	N
At some point soon--I do not know exactly when that nomination will come through the Senate, but it is our hope that we woulmove your nomination anhis fairly quickly.	N
I do not know what all they are, but I know that some of these entities woullike to have some finality before the enof the business quarter.	N
Are you going to try to sort of clear the decks now so that the new person does not have to deal with that?	N
We are going to try to wrap this up, but I know that Senator Warner wanteto be here, but because of some schedule changes today in the Senate, he coulnot.	N
But Senator Warner is a big proponent of yours, big supporter of yours, anhe wanteto be here to introduce you.	N
Let me just reminall Senators anstaff that we are going to try to have all written questions, follow-up questions in today by 6 o'clock.	N
As I understanit, between the two leaders on the Senate floor, there is no agreement yet on your nomination anthe other FCC nomination, but I am sure that Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, anothers will try to get these packageup anmovethrough as quickly as possible.	N
With that, I just want to thank you for your service on the Commission so far anwhat you have addeto the Commission anto the process.	N
Sometimes it just takes about a year ana half to get confirmed, but that is part of public service, anyou are doing goothings for our country, anI appreciate that.	N
I am going to do three nominees anFrank, Senator Lautenberg, is going to do three of the nominees.	N
I want to thank Senator Lautenberg for chairing the panel anfor his total commitment--he is sort of the founder or keeper of Amtrak.	N
I want to welcome Mr. Scott Quehl, who I just met, the President's nominee to be Chief Financial Officer anAssistant Secretary of Administration for the Department of Commerce.	N
If confirmed, you will be responsible for overseeing the Department's financial resources, human resources, anfacilities.	N
With the Department's $17 billion budget, I am confident that your financial management experience will serve you well in carrying out these responsibilities.	D
I am also pleaseto welcome Suresh Kumar, the President's nominee to be the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary of Trade Promotion anDirector General of the U.S. Foreign anCommercial Services.	N
Also, Mr. Philip Coyle has been nominateto be Associate Director for National Security anInternational Affairs in the Office of Science anTechnology, OSTP, run by a very great man, indeed.	N
I hope, Mr. Coyle, that your nomination will serve to highlight the importance of science in an inescapably globally connecteworld.	N
I now will turn to Frank Lautenberg, Senator Lautenberg, for any comments he might have, anthen we will have introductions.	N
In any event, first of all, let me say that when we see two distinguisheSenators, as we have, at the witness table, we can be sure that the people that they are here to acknowledge angreet are well-traineandeserve the opportunity that they have been nominatefor.	N
He is really well-qualified, anI want to support his nomination to serve on the Boarof Amtrak.	D
The American people anour Nation's passenger rail system will be well serveby having Tony on the board.	D
He is the Chairman of the New York/New Jersey Port Authority anhas learnean awful lot about transportation anthe needs for our region.	D
When I think about families who are making travel plans for the holidays, I also think about the kinof problems that one coulhave getting through in their means of travel.	N
When America has a vibrant antruly national passenger rail system, there will be fewer lines, fewer hassles andelays because our travelers will have more options.	N
AnMr. Chairman, without your help, it never woulhave passed, anI am grateful to you for that.	N
I know Tony can help make that law a success anhelp realize our vision of Amtrak becoming one of the premier passenger rail systems in the world, anI want it done in 5 years from now.	D
As Chairman of the Boarfor the Port Authority of New Jersey anNew York, he has distinguishehimself as one of the Nation's transportation experts.	D
With experience achieving those goals in the most densely packeregion in the country, Amtrak can be a better-run ansmarter operation than it has now, saving more money, carrying more passengers, anexpanding service into new areas of the country.	N
AnI know that our distinguishecolleague Senator Hutchison is very much interestein rail service anpromoting that.	N
While at the Port Authority, Tony lethe adoption of a $29 billion capital plan that spans over 10 years.	D
The plan is going to help develop a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, expanaviation facilities for our busy region, anrebuilthe WorlTrade Center site.	N
AnI was a Commissioner of the Port Authority before I came here, anI have got some sense of what it takes to manage this complex organization.	N
Anwith Tony Coscia on the Amtrak board, I think our confidence has been boostethat we can accomplish the goals that we woullike.	N
I am also pleaseto introduce another New Jerseyian, Suresh Kumar, a New Jersey resident who is President Obama's nominee to heathe UniteStates anForeign Commercial Service at the Department of Commerce.	N
The Commerce Department anits Foreign Commercial Service play a critical role in getting America's goods anservices overseas ancreating new jobs here at home.	N
Especially in these difficult times, that job takes someone who understands government, understands business, anunderstands how the two can effectively work together.	N
Let me thank you anthe Ranking Member for the opportunity to join Senator Lautenberg in joining in introducing Anthony Coscia as one of President Obama's nominees for the Amtrak Boarof Directors.	N
Anlet me take the occasion to salute Senator Lautenberg's leadership on the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation.	N
There isn't a better, stronger, most effective advocate for mass transit in this country, particularly rail transit, than Senator Lautenberg.	D
Anhe has proven that over his time here in the U.S. Senate anhas made the country better as a result of it.	D
I think there is a growing recognition that investing in passenger rail can strengthen our country in numerous ways--	N
creating jobs, reducing dependence on foreign oil, cleaning the air that we breathe anthe climate our children angrandchildren will inherit--anI believe passenger rail is an absolutely essential part of solving our transportation challenges.	N
AnI am glathat this Administration has taken numerous steps to signal its commitment to this issue, including spearheading a long-awaitehigh-speerail network.	N
In short, now is the time to strengthen Amtrak analso provide it with firm leadership as it expands into a central component of our transportation future.	N
Tony Coscia is the right person at the right time to help leaAmtrak as a Member of its Boarof Directors.	N
As Senator Lautenberg said, he has, since 2003, been the Chairman of the Boarof Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York anNew Jersey, where he oversees a nearly $7 billion annual budget while managing some of the most critical infrastructure facilities in the region anin the country.	D
Those include the PATH commuter railroad, five airports, four port facilities, six bridges antunnels, anthe WorlTrade Center.	N
As Chairman, he has workediligently to ensure the safety ansecurity of the Port Authority's facilities, improve the transportation networks between New York anNew Jersey, anspearheadethe agency's new mass transit rail initiatives.	D
He, prior to this work, spent 11 years as Chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, where he worketo strengthen the Garden State's economic base anrevitalize communities through job creation anretention.	D
Now I have workeclosely with many people, Mr. Chairman, over the 37 years of my public service.	N
I have never seen someone who has the scope of intellect, breadth of experience, as well as someone who can bring people together in common cause to achieve a goal as Tony Coscia has.	D
Anhe has great management skills to ato that, as well as his commitment to improving the Nation's rail transportation center, as is evidenceby the latest, most significant project we are seeing in the country--a new mass transit tunnel leading between New York anNew Jersey, about an $8 billion to $9 billion program that will move literally thousands anthousands of people successfully each anevery day.	D
So given his proven leadership skills, I certainly am confident of what he can do for Amtrak.	D
I urge you, Mr. Chairman anthe Committee, to expeditiously support his nomination, senit to the Senate for full confirmation, where I look forwarto being able to support him on the floor.	N
Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to introduce Bert DiClemente, one of the President's nominees for the Amtrak Boarof Directors.	N
He serveas a State Director in Delaware for then-Senator Joe Biden for 20 of those years.	D
So he has been a colleague, a trusteadviser to Joe Biden anto me, ana dear frienfor a long, long time.	D
I can recommenhim to the Committee strongly, unequivocally, ancompletely without reservation.	N
Bert was namefor his father, who workefor railroads his entire career, including at Amtrak, from which he retirein 1976.	N
As long as I have known Bert, he has been passionately interestein railroads anAmtrak.	D
Equally as important, Bert has been intimately involvefor almost every aspect of Amtrak for decades.	D
He has been involvewith many Amtrak projects, the Amtrak shops, Amtrak management, Amtrak labor issues, especially Amtrak labor issues.	D
He knows Amtrak, anhe knows its people--hundreds, if not thousands--its challenges, its strengths anweaknesses very, very well.	D
I can assure this Committee that he will take on these responsibilities with sincere dedication anpurpose.	D
He will be an excellent leader andirector on the Amtrak Boarif the Senate chooses to confirm him, which I certainly hope it will.	D
That woulbe Suresh Kumar, nominee to be Director of U.S. anForeign Commercial Service; Philip Coyle, nominee to be Associate Director at the Office of Science anTechnology Policy; anMr. Scott Quehl, nominateto be Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Commerce.	N
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank all of you for being willing to make the sacrifices to serve.	D
With respect to dual-use technologies, which is going to be a major part of your portfolio, that obviously can be usein military as well as commercial products anfor purposes.	N
How can we promote American innovation without jeopardizing national security, when we are working with countries where there may be a security threat in the future?	N
We will look forwarto hearing more as you are in the job about the measures that you are taking.	N
Well, that is so important, anI appreciate what you saibecause exporting does create jobs in America, anthat is what we all want right now, of course.	N
I know that there are other things that you coulbe doing anhave done where you coulmake a lot more money, anI appreciate your sacrifice, especially Mr. Quehl with a young family.	D
We have about $53 billion worth of trade a year, anwe are very interestein Florida in getting these free trade agreements pursueby this Congress anthe Administration, hopefully, pursuing them.	N
So I want to speak to you specifically about what role you will play, anwill you be an advocate for the consideration of the Colombia, the Panama, anthe Korea free trade agreements?	N
Your Commercial Service does a great job, anI have encounterethem overseas in the embassies anhow they are bringing in businesses.	D
But one thing that we have learned, Mr. Chairman, from previous hearings that we have had, is that not enough of our small business people know about the goowork that you do in connecting them with foreign businesses.	N
So anything that you can do to be an educational conduit to small businesses--we have 1.9 million small businesses in Florida--we woulreally appreciate that.	N
I, too, want to thank our nominees for their public service in the past anwillingness to do it in the future anthe contributions that your families make, too.	N
I know that any time you enter into the realm of public service, it is a family commitment.	D
Harking back, I have got BRAC tattooeon my brain, like Senator Hutchison perhaps does, too, anI want to compliment you on the goojudgment you exerciseduring the BRAC process, by the way.	N
I do want to piggyback on Senator LeMieux's question, though, anget a little more into this issue.	N
Maybe we woulhave a difference of opinion, but you have said, anI guess this is from testimony earlier this year in front of the House ArmeServices Committee that--or that you wrote that, ``it is clear that the ground-basemissile defense system anthe U.S. missile defense system proposefor Europe require challenging anrealistic testing before Congress anthe Administration can determine if those systems can be operationally effective.''	N
Now what Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Staff, has saithat--anthis was in testimony before the ArmeServices Committee--that ``I believe UniteStates has a viable initial operational capability, that we are maturing the system towara full operational capability.''	N
Anthen earlier this year, at a hearing before the Senate ArmeServices Committee, Admiral Keating, who is the PACOM combatant commander, testifiethat he believethe UniteStates haa high probability of intercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile aimeat the UniteStates by North Korea.	N
AnI guess the question I have is how do you reconcile sort of your view, assessment of the operational effectiveness of the ground-basemissile defense system with the statements that are being made by some of our military leadership combatant commanders?	N
Anin that testimony before the House ArmeServices Committee, anthis was earlier again this year, you wrote of the neeto increase testing, which you just mentioned, for ballistic missile defense systems, including the ground-basemid-course defense system.	N
Anyet the Missile Defense Agency Director, General O'Reilly, testifiethis year before Congress that the Missile Defense Agency was moving away from conducting two ground-basemissile defense tests per year to one test every 9 months.	N
What is your view of this new, slower rate of testing, ando you assess that the Missile Defense Agency has the ability to conduct at least two ground-basemissile defense flight tests per year?	N
We agreed, I shoulsay, to a negotiating agenda at the U.N. conference on disarmament that commits the U.S. to a treaty on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.	N
I think we neeto understanthe scope of the impact that that kinof a treaty coulhave on our defense anU.S. defense programs.	N
AnI woulask you--anyou don't have to do this now, but if you coulfurnish this--to identify for the Committee those U.S. defense systems that currently are in the fielor in development that might directly or indirectly be useto support an anti-satellite capability.	N
I know when there is a gooshow people linger on, but now we have substantially reducethe size of the crowd.	N
Anthis is a position that this will be considerein the final analysis the coup d'etat.	N
So, seriously, it is because Senator Rockefeller has haa problem with his leg, anso the chair is nice.	N
Anyway, on the serious side, I couldn't stay for the other panel, but I particularly was focuseon this panel because it has so much relevance to the subject that sits right in front of us.	N
Particularly coming from our Northeast corner with the crowding anthe desperate neethat we have for getting, finding ways to reduce the traffic congestion anbetter environmental condition, less dependence on foreign oil angiving people a chance to know that, for the most part, they can arrive at their destinations on time, regardless of weather, annot having to go to an airport where they are competing for space with people going to lots of different places.	N
Anwe have seen some pretty goodevelopment at Amtrak over the years, anwe are pleaseto have the two of you who are seeking seats on the Amtrak board.	N
AnMr. Rosekind, you come with a lot of experience, anwe neethe kinof skills that you have developeon the reviews of what is happening on our National Transportation Safety Boarto make sure that if accidents do happen, we learn enough to try to prevent them from happening in the future.	D
She is welcome here, anyou might see something arounhere that you woullike to have more contact with on a regular anpermanent basis.	D
Senator Lautenberg, Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, anmembers of the Committee, I am honoreto speak with you today anappreciate the opportunity to make a few comments about the NTSB anto address any questions that you may have.	N
First, I woullike to thank President Obama for nominating me to be a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board.	N
Before I begin, please let me introduce some special people that are joining us today--my wife, Dr. Debra Babcock, who is a Pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay area, is joining us.	N
Anviewing in California are my son, Aaron; my daughter, Eve; my mother, Marilyn Rosekind; anmy mother-in-law, Lila Babcock.	N
I also woullike to thank the other colleagues anfriends who have joineus today, especially those from the NTSB, including Chairman Hersman.	N
The primary mission of the NTSB is to enhance transportation safety, which touches everyone's life in some way anprovides an invaluable contribution to the American people.	N
Global, around-the-clock transportation demands continue to increase, operations change to meet these demands, antechnology rapidly advances.	N
Given these ongoing changes in the transportation system, it is critical that the NTSB continually evolves anenhances its knowledge, capabilities, anexpertise.	N
Chairman Hersman has already providea vision aninitiateactions that acknowledge these issues.	N
She has challengethe men anwomen of the NTSB to ``raise the bar'' anspecifically has identifietransparency, accountability, anintegrity as initial areas for action.	D
It is important to all Americans that the NTSB remains a leading edge resource in its never-ending responsibility to enhance transportation safety.	N
If confirmed, I look forwarto collaboration with the NTSB's outstanding professionals to pursue every avenue possible to improve the agency's effectiveness anvalue.	N
The classic description of the NTSB is that it is the premier accident investigation anrecommendation agency in the world.	N
For more than 40 years, this world-class reputation has been built upon the NTSB's harwork to reach meaningful outcomes anconsistently exceeits mission objectives.	N
In my interactions with the NTSB over the past 15 years, it is clear that like any great institution, the men anwomen who comprise the agency's extraordinary staff are the core of its success.	N
Every day, these 400 professionals pursue their work antheir passion to enhance transportation safety.	N
They understanthe unique role of the NTSB as an independent annonregulatory agency taskewith enhancing transportation safety through meticulous investigations, fact-baseanthoughtful recommendations, anthe strategic use of its other available tools.	N
The NTSB's success in achieving its mission is meaningful far beyonits findings anrecommendations.	N
Its efforts translate into highly critical anpersonal terms, the opportunity to prevent injuries ansave lives.	N
It is this objective that drives the men anwomen of the NTSB to pursue anachieve their mission.	N
Recently, the Board's professionals voteit as one of the best places in Government to work.	N
My own passion has been to study human fatigue anapply scientific knowledge to improve performance ansafety in diverse settings, including all modes of transportation.	N
Clearly, over the years, the NTSB's findings anmy professional endeavors have leus to the same conclusion--that effectively managing fatigue is a critical factor in human performance antransportation safety.	N
If confirmed, I pledge to President Obama, this Senate committee, Congress, the men anwomen of the NTSB, and, most importantly, the American people that I will contribute all of my energy, knowledge, anexpertise to further enhance transportation safety.	N
If permitteto serve as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board, it woulbe a tremendous professional anpersonal honor to contribute in any way possible to the vital mission of this invaluable agency.	N
Thank you, every one of you, for your excellent testimony anyour wish to make a contribution.	N
Knowing what I do about the Amtrak nominees, I am convincethat you have the desire to make a difference.	N
I assume, Dr. Rosekind, with you, that as you describethe value of the agency, that you are all committeto making a welcome contribution to how we function.	N
speerail in France anJapan anSpain, the GAO founthat these countries committesignificant Government support for their high-speerail system.	N
But we are different in this country, anevery year, we have got a routine where you have to fight for just enough funds to keep Amtrak afloat.	N
This has been an area of great interest to me because of the deficiencies that exist for not having done it for so many years.	N
I think it is fairly easy to say that there woulbe a lot of difference in the congestion that we see in the other modes of travel if we hamade the investments at a reasonable time anlevel.	N
I was struck by the fact that Germany at one point committe$70 billion over a 10-year perioto builtheir high-speesystem, anthey got on with it andiit.	N
Government corporation, we hato beg anborrow, anI am not sure what the total commitment that has been made, but I think that over the years, it hasn't equale$1 billion a year.	N
Now I don't want you to be put in a position at your introduction to the Senate that you are going to be asking for more money, but apart from your specific suggestion, your specific role in finding how we get these systems up anrunning that come close to matching those that are some of the most efficient high-speesystems in other countries?	N
The question askereally is kinof tongue-in-cheek because we have seen the things that can be done where the investments are made.	N
Anif you look at what we spenon rail anlook at what we spento subsidize aviation, they are gooinvestments.	N
Even with that, we are overwhelmeby the traffic needs in aviation, on highways, anrail is the most laggarof them all.	N
That is, since 1971, we have spent $33 billion on Amtrak, which is less, far less than a billion a year.	N
Anwe have got to be realistic about, unfortunately, how we are always competing for other needs in the country.	N
Foreign-ownemanufacturers of passenger cars anhigh-speerail equipment are very interestein competing for this new funding.	N
The revenues derivecoulbe enormous anthe opportunity for us to builanlearn what to do to satisfy the interests that lie arounthe country for corridors that coulso effectively use the equivalent of the Northeast Corridor, whether it is places out of Chicago that connect with St. Louis anDetroit or other cities arounthose, arounTexas.	N
If you go out West, you know that California has been getting going on some high-speecorridors there.	N
I hope that we are going to demonstrate our seriousness by moving the projects that we have underway that relate directly not just to the Northeast Corridor, but any of the corridors that we might be able to encourage development.	N
Now I know that you have experience in the understanding of fatigue anwhat erratic sleep does.	D
I almost inviteyou to come over to my house, but the fact is that it is a serious problem.	N
Shoulthey be mandateon all commercial vehicles, motor vehicles, do you think, to keep fatiguedrivers, tiredrivers off the road?	N
Earlier this year, Dr. Rosekind, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashein Buffalo anresultein 50 fatalities.	N
The captain anfirst officer of the aircraft both commutelong distances from their homes to their operating base in Newark, sleeping very little before their scheduleshift.	N
Now has the airline industry done enough to ensure that commercial air pilots are well rested, not flying under fatigue conditions?	N
Yes, we also know that trainees are often--anthis is not something that you can help with directly, except in your research when the occasion, unfortunately, requires it.	N
Anthere are very modest salaries in the early years, anas a consequence, their people are forceto take a seconjob.	N
Seconjob, antravelling long distances is a recipe for problems, anwe don't want to see that happen.	N
I will conclude with one question more, Senator Hutchison, anthat is to Mr. Coscia anMr. DiClemente, about passenger rail being more energy efficient, anhaving fewer emissions than driving or flying.	N
But passenger rail still lags behinother modes in passenger miles, anAmtrak is operating at half its capacity.	N
Maybe this woulbe redundant because we have already discussehow can Amtrak increase its ridership?	N
Have you haa chance to think about that anget people attracteto going by train anout of their cars, anI say this hesitatingly, but out of the planes.	N
Because one of the things that will relieve congestion in the sky is making room for passengers who will take the train anthereby permit us to operate more efficiently with air schedules.	N
I have been a strong supporter of Amtrak, anit is a partnership that is baseon the national concept.	N
AnI want to ask the two nominees for Amtrak if you are committeto keeping the national system besides the Northeast Corridor, which is the system that has gotten the most of the resources, anthe track is owneby Amtrak.	N
But the rest of the country I think also must keep this infrastructure if we are going to have a truly national system, which I think is important for us.	N
AnI think now that more states are looking at options for rail, that it woulprovide us the opportunity to have rail that comes into anout of the Amtrak stations anproviding better ridership anbetter service.	N
I know Mr. Rosekind's area of expertise is fatigue, anI know that you askequestions about that area.	D
So I won't ask questions of Mr. Rosekind, but appreciate very much your nomination anlook forwarto working with all of you.	N
I know your interest in this work over these years, anyou will continue doing that whatever your capacity is.	N
I welcome everyone to this meeting of the Committee on Commerce, Science anTransportation, anspecifically to the nomination hearing of Dr. Carl Wieman, to be Associate Director for Science of the Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
So what we'll do is we'll leave the recoropen for a few days for those Senators who woullike to submit questions.	N
The OSTP can have up to four Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmeassociate directors.	N
If confirmed, Dr. Wieman will be responsible for coordinating, monitoring, anadvising on national research priorities aninter-agency programs within OSTP's portfolio.	N
According to OSTP Director Dr. Holdren, the Associate Director for Science will oversee STEM education activities anhe will act as an expert adviser to the OSTP Director.	N
The advisers offer timely technical counsel to the President anhis senior staff on significant policy matters.	N
Staff members inform goopolicy through sounscience ancoordinate among science antechnology-relateagencies.	N
Finally, the OSTP strives to make sure Americans' financial investments make the best possible contribution to our collective prosperity, public health, national security, anenvironmental quality.	N
Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me an opportunity to aadditional comments to the wonderful introduction you just made of Dr. Wieman.	N
I've known Carl for a number of years through his work as a Professor of Physics ana Presidential Teaching Scholar at the University of Colorado.	N
He is, as you pointeout, the President's nominee to be the Associate Director for Science at the White House Office of Science anTechnology Policy.	N
I'm deeply pleasethat President Obama recognizes the talent ancreativity that Carl will bring to our discussions on science anin particular STEM education.	N
You mentionethat Dr. Wieman won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for producing a new state of matter callethe Bose-Einstein condensate.	D
I once askehim, can you see it, anyou shoulmaybe perhaps ask him that during his testimony.	N
I also know in front of the Committee recently you hatwo Apollo astronauts, including the first human to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, who's an iconic figure to all of us.	N
While no doubt this is a remarkable achievement, I woulnote that 12 men have walkeon the Moon.	N
Interestingly enough, Carl's Nobel Prize-winning work built upon earlier work in laser cooling by the other Nobel Prize winner in President Obama's Administration, Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu.	D
While Dr. Wieman is most famous for winning the Nobel Prize, it is his commitment to teaching science to others that is Carl's most remarkable quality in my eyes.	D
He's currently the Director of the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative and, as you mentioned, still spends part of his time at the University of Colorado leading the science education initiative that he founded.	D
He was a founding Chair of the National Academy of Sciences Boaron Science Education anhe has won many accolades for his teaching.	D
I want to make sure we don't let this witness leave without asking him some tough questions.	N
Senator Udall, I have a few questions anI'll turn it over to you, anI may clean up unless you want to do a seconround.	N
But let me ask a question, anit may be the same question or it may be two different questions, but just for our backgrounon the Subcommittee: Woulyou describe your research on atomic physics anlaser spectroscopy and-or--	N
It's very gooto have you here today, Dr. Wieman, anwe look forwarto your work in the executive branch, especially in the teaching area.	D
As a researcher, you relieon the NIST facility in Boulder, Colorado, to help achieve a scientific breakthrough that leto your joint Nobel Prize.	D
NIST anour national laboratories contribute much to science anapply some of the brightest minds in the country to some of the most significant challenges facing our Nation, from fighting terrorism to achieving energy independence.	N
The national labs I think are really crown jewels in our country's research infrastructure.	N
As Associate Director for Science, how woulyou employ the diverse knowledge anwork of the national labs in your efforts to improve our Nation's competitiveness anmaintain our leadership in scientific research?	N
We have two of the great national laboratories in New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory anSandia National Laboratory, that do a lot of the work that I talkeabout in terms of energy independence, helping the warrior out in the field, ana variety of other things.	N
Let me ask you a little bit about education because I know that's what you really want to focus on.	N
You note in your testimony that you attendea tiny rural school in western Oregon anrelieon a public library in a nearby town to supplement your education.	D
My home State of New Mexico also faces significant challenges when it comes to rural schools anespecially schools on tribal lands.	N
Do you have any thoughts on what efforts have been successful to overcome these challenges to teaching science in rural schools?	N
Do you have any recommendations for how better broadbanconnectivity or access to other technologies might put students in rural schools on a more even footing with their peers in metropolitan areas?	N
Analso, I talketo you before the hearing about how you've developetechniques anprotocols, I think, to teach science to children, anI'm interestein what are those protocols anhow do you approach it, anespecially dealing with disadvantagestudents.	D
According to this year's Science anEngineering Indicators Report of the National Science Board, although America continues to leain science anengineering, Asian countries are closing the gap through significantly increaseinvestments in science anengineering, business investment, aneducation aninfrastructure.	N
How will you apply your knowledge in an attempt to redirect America's course anget us going in the right direction again?	N
What provisions of America Competes have proven to be the most successful anwhich programs do you think shoulbe strengthened?	N
Well, as we go through a reauthorization, those are the kinof questions we'll be asking, basically how is it working, are there things that we neeto improve or delete or change, that kinof exercise.	N
STEM is a program that I think has been great in a lot of ways, anNASA has been kinof a leaagency.	N
They're places where science, engineering, anwhat-not come together antry to be innovative anget things out to the marketplace, etcetera.	N
I've seen first-hanin my state a science park really does some great things at the University of Arkansas.	N
But let me ask you from your perspective, to what extent do you believe that science parks can contribute to scientific discovery anto technological advances?	N
I think part of the key there is recognizing your strengths anhaving some flexibility anthe appropriate expectations.	N
I know one of the advantages of the one that's in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at least what I hear about it, is that because the University of Arkansas is a relatively small university--it's not a huge university; it only has about maybe 16 or 17,000 students--because it is smaller, that's actually a strength because the faculty anthe researchers tento know each other, they work in closer proximity, anthey say that they're better there in sharing ideas ancollaborating together than some of the older, more establisheinstitutions, if that makes sense, where you kinof get your area of expertise anyou're kinof so big that's all you do.	N
The other thing that they really focus on in Arkansas is trying to bring these ideas actually to the marketplace.	N
So like for example, in nanotechnology, their effort there, they don't just call it nanotechnology.	N
They like to call it ``nano manufacturing,'' because they really want to try to get these ideas out of the lab anget them out in the marketplace.	N
So I know not everybody has the same mission, nor shoulthey, because there's going to be different strengths andifferent roles as we do this.	N
But I agree, I think that they can play a very significant role in trying to stimulate more scientific activity, research activity, innovation, technology.	N
What we're going to do, Dr. Wieman, is we're going to leave the recoropen until 6 p.m. tomorrow, for all the Senators anstaffs who want to ask you more questions, like they want to get you to explain this Bose-Einstein thing one more time or something like that.	N
So what we'ask all the staffs to do anall the offices to do is to get those as quickly as possible over here to the Committee, anthen we'll get those to you, ana rapiresponse woulbe very much appreciated.	N
But I want to thank you for your willingness to take on this public service anreally do some great things there anplay a key role in developing this policy angiving advice to the folks who neeit.	D
So I want to thank you for being here today anthank you for all the folks you brought with you.	N
Dr. Scott Doney is being considerefor the Office of Chief Scientist of the National Oceanic anAtmospheric Association.	N
The Maritime Commission isn't known by everybody, but it really does important work anhopefully you're going to be there, or continue to be there.	N
NOAA's Administrator, Dr. Jane Lubchenco, has dedicateherself to advancing research, science, innovation antechnology at NOAA.	D
Dr. Doney's nomination as chief scientist is an important step in maintaining NOAA's status as a top science agency, which is very important in any government, in any Executive Branch, but particularly in this one, where there's a lot of pride in the science aspect of what they do.	N
We'll consider two nominations today to the Federal Maritime Commission, a little known, but very important independent regulatory agency.	N
I am pleasethat two very qualified, in my judgment, individuals have been selecteto serve on it.	D
Mr. Cordero anMs. Dye will have the balance anthe wisdom to do something which nobody has ever figureout how to do, which is to figure out: What is a proper balance between the needs of the shippers anthe needs of consumers anbusinesses importing anexporting products?	D
You've also servethe Maritime Administration, in the Department of Transportation, anworkein the House of Representatives.	D
I look forwarto hearing the results of Mrs. Dye's recent investigation into vessel capacity shortages.	D
I commenher for leading such a comprehensive effort anfor her service at the Federal Maritime Commission.	D
Anso, ending up my long speech, I thank the nominees for testifying today, anI urge a speedy confirmation for them.	N
Just let it be said, in an era of apparent conflict anmalfunction in the Congress, here are two people who do not have conflict anmalfunction.	N
I want to hear from her, anI also want to hear from our Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Frank Lautenberg.	N
These are very important positions: the Maritime Commissioners anthe NOAA Chief Scientist.	N
And, of course, being from a Gulf State, I know that NOAA anweather prediction are very important.	N
AnI will tell you that the technology of the last 10 to 15 years has been immensely helpful in the predictions of when a hurricane is going to hit, how forceful it's going to be, anwhat the route is.	N
AnI know that our most recent terrible hurricane, Ike, which hit in 2008, NOAA's advancehurricane warnings didefinitely minimize the loss of life.	N
AnI will say the property damage was huge, but we were able to open our ports to commerce quickly because we diknow what was going to happen, from the predictions.	N
This committee has the important responsibility of overseeing both the Federal Maritime Commission anNOAA.	N
AnI want to thank these nominees for agreeing to provide their services to the American people.	N
With international commerce growing as it has, the Federal Maritime Commission makes sure that our Nation's ports remain competitive ancan meet the demand--the growing demanplaceon them.	N
This is especially vital in my State, New Jersey, which is the home of Port Newark, the largest port on the East Coast, generating $20 billion a year in economic activity.	N
The Port of Newark is the lifeblooof, not just our region's economy, but also our Nation's economy.	N
In 2001, when the Port of Long Beach, in California, was shut down because of a labor dispute, it cost the economy $1 billion a day.	N
Anit just seems, with the ferocity of hurricanes antornados, anmost certainly with the things that are done in one area, we don't even really have goorecords about how it affects another area.	N
For instance, clouseeding in Midwest, anhow does it affect Colorado, or how does it affect another area downstream?	N
And, my question to you is: Do you think that it woulbe worth getting more data collected, when there are weather modification programs in different areas, to see how it affects that area anthen also other areas?	N
And, second, the possibility of studying modifying a hurricane when it is 20 miles out, rather than having it hit anhave such a devastating impact on people anproperty.	N
Do you think it woulbe worthwhile for NOAA to do the beginning planning anwhat woulbe the first step?	N
Because I think you're absolutely right, you don't want to do any weather modification; you want to study what the effects might be before you woulactually do something.	N
Just to start looking at what the options are, maybe talk to other scientists that might have lookeat this, as well.	N
It just seems like, with all that's happening, we ought to be proactive in studying it ankeeping data, at a very minimum.	N
Anthen, from that, perhaps seeing if there is a course that shoulbe taken, because you don't, I agree, want to do something until you know what the effect woulbe at the end.	N
I think you coverethe maritime issues very well, so I'm not going to have other questions there.	N
This is actually to both institutions--the Maritime Commission can know what deficiencies exist in ports anhow they neeto be included, or whatever other infrastructure is needealong the way.	N
You're putting out a report, coming out today, anthat's going to have a lot of information in it.	N
We do consider numerous nominees, but it's not too often that we welcome one of our own before us.	N
We diso when Debbie Hersman was nominateto the Chair of the NTSB anwhen DaviStricklanwas nominateto be the NHTSA Administrator.	N
Now we have Ann Begeman, who is nominateto be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.	N
As everyone knows well, she has been an important member of the Commerce Committee staff for over a decade, anwe welcome her nomination.	D
She helpecraft the Surface Transportation BoarReauthorization Act, which wouladdress long-time concerns by shippers about predatory pricing anpractices, increase competition, anestablish a level playing field.	D
Anthe reason I wanteto speak, Mr. Chairman, was I wanteto emphasize, since I won't be here for her questioning--I'll be at the Judiciary Committee--how important that bill is anthe work that must continue for our captive shippers.	N
Whenever I say that worat home, my 15-year-oldaughter asks me if I'm talking about pirates.	N
But I want to make clear that we still have a number of businesses in my state anfarmers who are very concerneabout what's happening.	N
When I first came to the Senate, they woultell me that the STB woulsimply not listen to their concerns.	N
Well, under new leadership, the STB is now listening to our shippers, examining anti-competitive issues, anconsidering next steps to ensure that America's freight rail customers receive fair rates angooservice.	N
Given Ms. Begeman's experience, once confirmed, I know she'll be ready to consider these very important issues.	D
I also woullike to mention Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, who's nominateto be the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Observation anPrediction of NOAA at the U.S. Department of Commerce.	N
NOAA's North Central River Forecast Center is vital to helping communities along the ReRiver in Minnesota anNorth Dakota another rivers in the upper Midwest prepare for flooding, with reports of water levels anrates of flow.	N
We're very concerneabout all of the snow we've haanwhat may happen in the next months with the ReRiver, anhaving these floopredictions is incredibly important for us.	N
I'll proceenow to my opening statement, followeby Senator Hutchison, anI think Senator Thune wants to make some remarks.	N
We start with the nomination of Ms. Begeman to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.	N
Beloveby all, respecteby all, she's a virtual institution on this committee, anin the Senate.	D
She's also a consummate professional, ever ready to come together to finsolutions to complex issues, anan expert on surface transportation issues.	D
I know Ms. Begeman will be able to dive right into the complicateissues that come before the STB.	D
These are very important issues, both for the captive shippers anfor the entire rail industry.	N
But on the other hand, I'm pleasethat she's headeinto a new position where the nation can benefit from her tremendous talent.	D
He's an expert on national security policy, military research andevelopment of military space systems.	D
The fact that this committee is again considering Mr. Coyle's nomination to be Associate Director for National Security anInternational Affairs at the Office of Science anTechnology Policy, OSTP, is a testament to the neefor such an expert in this post.	D
When there wasn't floor time for discussion on the matter, that became impossible, anthen we couldn't move him by unanimous consent, so President Obama recess-appointehim.	N
For the past 8 months Mr. Coyle has serveas an advisor to the administration on issues of critical national security importance, such as cybersecurity, emergency communications, aninternational science diplomacy.	D
But I am very pleaseto be able to introduce her as the nominee for membership on the Surface Transportation Board.	N
I think that the previous two statements from the majority side of the aisle show that Ann Begeman is effective.	D
She is in the category of nominee that no introduction to this committee is requirebecause we have workewith her for so long.	D
She previously servethe Committee as Deputy Staff Director anProfessional Staff Member on surface transportation issues for many years.	D
Between her tours of service on the Committee, she also serveas Legislative Director anActing Chief of Staff for Senator John McCain.	D
She has a well-earnereputation as an expert in transportation issues anis one of the go-to people in the Senate for anything relateto surface transportation.	D
I have relieon Ann's advice ancounsel for nearly 18 years since my earliest days in the Senate as a member of this committee.	D
The recently passeFAA Reauthorization Bill stands as a perfect example of Ann's steadfastness anperseverance.	N
In the last year alone, this committee has havictories large ansmall, ranging from the America COMPETES Act, the NASA Reauthorization Act, to the first movement in many years on Surface Transportation Boarreauthorization.	N
I think that speaks well of both of our staffs, Mr. Chairman, anhow well they have worketogether to move our committee, really, into the forefront of committees that have been active aneffective, ansent bills to the floor that passethe Senate.	N
In each of these areas ancountless others, Ann has been a strong leader ana creative force for the public's interest.	D
We don't often pause to recognize that type of humble service, but the country has been the fortunate beneficiary of people like Ann Begeman.	D
If you ask anyone who has workewith Ann Begeman how best to describe her, they will inevitably say that she is focuseon detail anis an excellent manager.	D
But I know that her knowledge, her experience, anher unwavering attention to detail will soon be focuseon complex surface transportation issues as a Member of the STB.	D
I have no doubt that Ann will make an immediate impact on the crucial rail issues facing our Nation.	D
I also want to welcome Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, who has been nominateto serve as Assistant Secretary.	N
It provides services such as hurricane forecasting that are essential to the protection of life anproperty.	N
When Hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast in 2008, I saw first-hanNOAA's advancewarning system work.	N
They pinpointewhere it was going anwhen it was going to hit, anallowethe protection of so much of the property that was involvein that hurricane.	N
AnI am pleaseto join this morning's nomination hearing anwant to welcome all of the nominees to the Committee.	N
Anat the risk of echoing what my colleagues have said--we're not ignoring the other members that are here for nomination today.	N
But I am here particularly, too, because Ann Begeman is appearing before this committee to serve as one of the three members of the Surface Transportation Board.	N
Many of us have hathe opportunity not just to work with Ann over the years as a Professional Staff Member on this committee anher years of work, on behalf of various colleagues.	D
town South Dakota girl who has brought her South Dakota work ethic anprofessionalism to Washington, D.C., anto the work of the U.S. Senate.	D
Ann has, as has already been mentioneby you, Mr. Chairman, by Senator Hutchison, an extraordinary recorof accomplishment over a long perioof time.	D
She is someone who I think has proven andemonstratethe ability to immerse herself into the technical details of the complex legislation that we deal with in front of this committee but, at the same time, still able to see the public policy implications of what we do from the 30,000 foot level.	D
Anthat's a unique combination of skills, in the realm in which we deal on a daily basis.	D
AnI can't think of anybody that is more qualifieor woulbe better equippeto serve as a Member of the Surface Transportation Board.	D
AnI say that as a former State Rail Director in South Dakota ansomeone who has workenot only on this committee, but in the in House of Representatives on the relevant committees that have jurisdiction over the nation's rail carriers.	D
Ann is incredibly capable antalenteand, when it comes to the rate anservice issues that are going to come before the Surface Transportation Board, is going to be extremely well-equippeto deal with those issues.	D
AnI have a high level of confidence that the Surface Transportation Boaris going to be extraordinarily well-serveby her presence there.	D
I will miss, I have to say, looking behinme to get answers to questions, as we often do look to her for her expertise.	D
But I know she is looking forwarto the service that she will provide the country at the STB, as are we.	D
Anso, I am delighteto be able to be here today to support a fellow South Dakotan ansomeone who comes from a small town calleHumboldt, South Dakota, anhas been a very humble public servant in her time here in Washington.	D
AnI hope that we can speethese nominations, as Senator Hutchison said, along through the Committee process anget them to the floor so we can get folks into the positions where they can begin making a difference for us.	N
Anyou haa little chance to relax a little bit anthink over your testimony, anwe look forwarto hearing it.	N
But, as you know, I'm here, Chairman Rockefeller anRanking Member Hutchison, anSenator Thune, to talk about an Ohioan.	N
From the Wright Brothers Bicycle Shop in Dayton, Ohio, to John Glenn's first orbit, your former colleague, Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon, Ohio has been at the forefront anhas haa rich history in flight ana tradition in flight, science anaerospace.	N
After the oil spill incident of recent times, there were about, I think maybe 15 deadolphins that washeup on the shores of the Gulf.	N
Anso, that sort of symbolizes a question which I think is almost impossible to ask, because I want to see how well you do in answering it.	N
I'm not sure that your position calls for you to be balanced, ansome of us discussethat honestly.	N
There's always, well--we can balance the needs of the natural order on Earth anthe needs of our country economically, et cetera.	N
I'm going to focus on Mr. Coyle anDr. Sullivan, because I know Ann so well, anI think you have been very forthcoming.	D
Mr. Coyle, if I couljust interrupt you, your view of our missile defense system, however, is going to make a difference, because you do have a purview of national security--it is a different area, but your comments in the past have raisequestions about your view of missile defense, which I think is going to be important in the decision about your posture in national defense issues.	D
So, may I ask you, do you support, then, the deployment of a missile defense system if you consider that it is scientifically ready?	N
You are saying you support missile defense because of the threats that we have, anthat even if we didn't have the threats that we have, you woulstill encourage having the research antechnology to have a deployable missile defense system--I'm putting words in your mouth but----	D
Do you think that we shoulbe doing more, anit is worth pursuing more of an effort, to get the data collection on what does happen now anits effects on other areas, to begin to look at whether it is the right thing to do, to try to modify, say, hurricane intensity?	N
But, to finout better what the effects might be, shoulwe be focusing more on either data collection or research?	N
AnI understanperhaps that you don't have the capability, or the information, rather, from the agency.	N
I guess my last question woulbe, woulyou work with me anmy staff to determine what areas we might pursue to upgrade our information in a positive way?	N
Let me just say that you cannot finin this Senate anybody who's more opposeto a missile defense system than I am.	N
But that makes absolutely no difference to me with respect to your position, because OSTP has absolutely nothing to do with missile defense.	N
But you are going to get my vote, because OSTP does not work on this, anyou work for OSTP.	N
What you work on are the responsibilities of the Department of Defense anthe National Security Council anothers, but OSTP champions science antechnology.	N
So, is it not fair to say that you have absolutely no responsibility for operations, acquisitions or deployments of things such as the missile defense system?	N
Senator Feinstein, I realize that you anSenator Boxer want to introduce, but there may be others who want to give opening statements.	N
So we have two distinguishepeople this afternoon before us, anthe first is John Bryson of California.	N
Much of the conversation today is going to focus on Mr. Bryson, who has a varieanvery impressive resume, ana backgrounrunning an extremely large utility company in California for a very long time.	D
But on the other hand, some have raiseconcerns about Mr. Bryson's experience as a founding member of an environmental organization that has, at times, usevery aggressive tactics, including suing Mr. Bryson anhis company, anthen also having policies that don't necessarily comport with some views helby others on the Committee.	D
Others have raiseconcerns about his support for a 2009 proposal to cap emissions, which was a position widely helin the utility industry.	N
That said, I neeto tell you that I haa very productive anpositive meeting with Mr. Bryson last week when he visitemy office, anI have great respect for his desire to serve our country.	D
But along with that, I have enormous faith in his creative ability through his executive experience to finways to stimulate manufacturing--which this Committee is dedicating itself to for the rest of the year annext--anthat he has the kinof ability to create jobs in America.	D
The nominations of Mr. Bryson anMr. Garcia come at an incredible crossroads for the country anfor the Commerce Department.	D
High unemployment, a slow recovery, the Commerce Secretary anDeputy Secretary play an enormous role in supporting jobs anour economy.	N
Manufacturing has been hit harover the last decade--losing, as everybody knows, nearly one-thirof its workforce--anthe Government's response has been piecemeal to tepid.	N
If in the next decade, things are as bafor manufacturing jobs as the previous decade, we will have little left in that sector to save.	N
This, in turn, has grave national security implications ancoulcripple our ability to out-innovate anout-compete other countries.	N
Next week, I'm holding a full Committee fielhearing in West Virginia on exporting products made in America.	N
I'm also going to introduce a slew of bills in the next number of days, which are on point, I believe.	N
For the foreseeable future, I intento use this Committee to finways to make manufacturing a spark in our job-creating agenda.	N
For example, almost two-thirds of our department's budget is dedicateto NOAA, the National Oceanic anAtmospheric Administration.	N
AnI want to hear about Mr. Bryson's views anMr. Garcia's views on the Administration's reorganization proposal.	N
They are not necessarily leaving NOAA alone, I think to a great disadvantage of our country.	N
NOAA's weather satellites, I want to talk about that, anthe Department's cybersecurity efforts.	N
Mr. Chairman, we have before us today the two most senior positions with the Department of Commerce, which is taskewith promoting business, creating jobs, anspurring economic growth.	N
While this has always been important, it is most essential now, with an unemployment rate at 9.1 percent.	N
The Administration has talkea great deal about job creation anthe neefor regulatory reform.	N
Since taking office, President Obama has grown the size of the federal regulatory workforce by more than 16 percent, by some estimates.	N
There are now more than 275,000 federal employees whose entire focus is adding to the ever-expanding regulatory burden of America's job creators.	N
So while there has been talk about streamlining regulation, we see the Federal Register come on schedule every day with even more proposerules for innovators anjob creators to negotiate.	N
You know what, I don't have--oh, yes, I do have arrivals, which happens to be a Senator Lautenberg.	N
Anwe have a distinguishecolleague at the desk, anI don't want to take too much time.	N
But I've got to say, we are so lucky to have someone with the qualifications that John Bryson anTerry Garcia bring to these positions.	N
In addition to being very proufathers, we're both former CEOs while we care about the environment anthe well-	N
So in order to try anmeet the short time deadline, I introduce a letter from the Business Roundtable that was sent June 21.	N
Anthey write, John Engler, who's the President, I believe, of the organization--anyway, he says here that John Bryson's extensive experience in the private sector has well-	D
equippehim to take on the many issues the department must address to support the U.S. economy anjob creation, issues like technology, innovation, intellectual property, antrade.	N
Anthey reminus that the Business Roundtable is an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies with nearly $6 trillion in annual revenues anmore than 13 million employees.	N
It's harto finsomething better than that, analso the fact that he's careabout the environment is deserving of credibility ansupport.	N
So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for doing this, anas I look at Mr. Bryson's background--18 years chairman anCEO of Edison International, delivers power to nearly 14 million Californians, holds the distinction of being our country's top buyer of renewable energy.	D
Friends, we're lucky to get someone like this who wants to sit in here ando the job that they have to do, sacrifice lots of things in the outside world.	D
Anwe ought to just move on this thing anstop the obstructionism that so often invades a review of a person's qualifications, without looking at the qualification.	N
With the permission of the Committee, I'm going to ask that Senator Feinstein be able to go aheaanintroduce John Bryson, anthen we will return to our----	N
AnI see members of the Intelligence Committee here, so I know they're not playing hooky, but it's gooto be here.	N
I have the distinct pleasure today to introduce to the Committee John Bryson, a former chairman, CEO, anpresident of Edison International, anmost importantly to Senator Boxer anmyself, a Californian.	D
On May 31, John was nominateby President Obama to serve as the 37th Secretary of Commerce.	D
I believe that he is enormously well-suitefor this important role, particularly at a time when our economy remains fragile anjob creation isn't occurring fast enough.	D
John's experience running a multibillion dollar company, a very large utility, his success as a strong advocate for business, anhis readiness to advance a jobs agenda make him a strong anpositive fit for Commerce Secretary.	D
That's the parent company of Southern California Edison, which provides power to 14 million Californians annearly 300,000 businesses.	N
As the Committee will recall, in 2000 an2001, California was grippeby an energy crisis that resultein rolling blackouts that left millions of Californians in the dark.	N
I watcheclosely as he successfully fendeoff financial disaster, even as other California utilities were not so fortunate.	D
I met anspoke with John Bryson often during that energy crisis anremember well his intelligence anpragmatism as utilities, state officials, anWashington worketheir way through the crisis.	D
In my observation, he workeharfor the people of California, his shareholders, anthe many businesses that relieon a stable power grid.	D
I believe John will carry the same thoughtful, sensible leadership style with him to the Commerce Department.	D
Anduring his years at Edison International, John's leadership of this very large utility was strong aneffective.	D
Well, Edison International, headquarterein Southern California, at this time ownea portfolio that was 40 percent coal.	N
As a result of this also, he hadiversifiethe investment portfolio of that great utility.	D
But nonetheless, I respecteit, because he hasuch a heavy presence at the time, not in California, but in other states, in coal.	D
Simply put, he understands what businesses neeto succeed, anI think will bring that approach to the department, if confirmed.	D
In addition, he has serveas a director, chairman, or adviser for a wide array of companies, schools, annonprofits, including many institutions with deep roots in California, such as a director of the Walt Disney Company, BrightSource Energy, Boeing, anassets manager KKR, the California Business Roundtable, the Public Policy Institute of California, anUSC's Keck School of Medicine.	D
It includes the Council for Foreign Relations, StanforUniversity, California Institute of Technology, anthe California Endowment.	N
I'm also prouto note that he anI share the same alma mater, Stanford, were John earnehis undergraduate degree.	D
John's experience paints a picture of a leader who focuses on the practical anthe achievable.	D
At this time in our troubleeconomic history, our number one priority as a government must be to grow this economy.	N
In my view, John's combination of pragmatism, experience in the boardroom, anunderstanding of the public sector will make him an outstanding Secretary of Commerce.	D
I expect he will be a powerful voice inside the Administration ana partner with the business community to grow our economy anopen international markets for American manufacturers.	D
AnI very much thank you for the courtesy, Senator Rockefeller, analso for that of your committee.	N
I often say at home, I'm chairman of a committee, anSenator Feinstein is, but the difference is, I can talk about my work anshe really can't say that much about hers, because the Intelligence Committee is kinof secretive, so we wish you well.	D
AnI want to say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I think that our country is really better servewhen the people pay attention to the work we do.	N
I hope they pay attention to this nomination anthe way this particular nominee is treated.	N
I coulspeak personally that Senator Lautenberg is right when he says, thank you, John, for accepting this challenge.	N
You bring a wealth of experience in both the private sector anthe public sector to this very important job.	D
What I'm going to do is, Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, is to ask you to put my statement in the record.	N
AnI woullike to conclude with a quote from the Los Angeles Times, June 21, a wonderful editorial, anI'll close with that within my time.	N
The headline says, ``Commerce Department nominee deserves the job,'' anthe subheais, ``Within a rational political universe, John Bryson's credentials woulbring him confirmation by acclamation.''	D
Anhere's what they say, in part, ``A long-time chairman anchief executive of Southern California Edison anEdison International, he is a pillar of the region's business community, admireby the Chamber of Commerce anhis fellow executives.	D
He also was a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, where his work earnehim respect anappreciation from California's environmental movement.	D
He's been president of the California Public Utilities Commission anhe even serveas a director of Boeing, dipping his toe into the nation's military-industrial complex.	D
Anthat's why I say--my editorial--I hope everybody follows this in politics, whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent, because John is the rare nominee to present himself to Congress with endorsements from the Chamber, military suppliers, anthe nation's leading environmental organizations.	D
If ever there was a time for someone who can bring us all together, this is that moment in history.	N
Tom Donohue of the Chamber said, Mr. Bryson's ``extensive knowledge of the private sector anyears of experience successfully running a major company'' makes him qualified.	D
The Business Roundtable calleMr. Bryson, quote, ``A proven, well-respecteexecutive who will bring his private sector experience to the Commerce Department's broaportfolio that includes technology, trade, intellectual property, anexports, which will be crucial to expanding the economy ancreating jobs.''	D
I notein your opening statement, John, that you talkeabout your work with colleagues in founding the NRDC, anit was before RicharNixon signethe Clean Air Act anthe Clean Water Act anthe rivers were on fire at that time.	D
AnI want to thank you for that, because I finmyself quoting RicharNixon quite a lot on the floor of the U.S. Senate these days, as there are moves to repeal this or that part of our landmark laws.	N
AnI'm just thrillewith the nomination, anI thank you for the honor of being able to speak today.	N
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that a full opening text be placein the recoras if reain full.	N
AnI ask that a letter to you, Mr. Chairman, from Congressman Tierney anCongressman Frank, regarding Massachusetts fisheries, be made part of the record.	N
We share a mutual friend, DaviRadcliffe, who tolme yesterday at breakfast to tell you hello again, so I want to be sure ansenthat along.	N
AnI hear the admonition louanclear, but I'm tempteto make one other admonition to all of us.	N
Anthis gentleman was on the Boarof Directors of the Boeing Company, which right now is in the middle of a major controversy brought about by the NLRB when it's about to open a plant that's going to hire 1,000 Americans.	D
So I think it's fair to ask civility on both sides of the issue of jobs, civility on the part of the regulators to not continually be on the backs of employers at a time we don't neeit, ancivility on our part to expedite the movement of America to more trade, more commerce, anmore prosperity.	N
AnI'like to echo Senator Toomey's comments about trade anlook forwarto hearing Mr. Bryson's observations about what we do to trade.	D
I haa chance to see the U.S. Trade Representative, Ron Kirk the other night, anI'm hopeful, as he is, that we'll see the current trade agreements come to the Congress, anwe'll see an active effort to be sure that we open trade opportunities to Americans.	N
I think that we're going to lose a real opportunity in this country if we don't pursue a competitive agenda for America.	N
Some of it is under your agency, but some of it simply shoulcome with the neeto have someone that brings agencies together anfocuses on moving our country forwarcompetitively.	N
Anthe things we talkeabout, workforce readiness so that we have people actually getting degrees angetting trainein jobs where we neethem.	N
Obviously, that's working with the Department of Education, but when they can't fina welder in southern Minnesota to work at agriculture equipment places that are trying to finhighly paiemployees, we've got a problem.	N
Small anmedium-sizebusinesses with exports, helping them to have the kinof resources that they need, which can be very small investment for the big gain they get.	N
Working with the State Department so that our large businesses are better able to get contracts anget assistance from our agencies another countries, in order to follow through on the President's pledge to double exports.	N
The rules anregulations, which some of my colleagues have referenced--we no longer are competing in a vacuum in this country.	N
Our businesses are competing against companies in other countries that have different rules anregulations.	N
Anthen one specific area that the Commerce Department has direct jurisdiction over, where I think it's not just the low-	N
We talkeabout the fact that we have lost 16 percent of the international tourism business in this country.	N
It's not about the economy, as the leading Republican on our committee, Senator Blunt, knows.	N
India takes 93 days average to get a visa from Shanghai to come to America, anit takes only 10 days to go to Great Britain.	N
Every one of these foreign tourists spends an average of $5,000 when they come to this country.	N
So if we want to meet the President's goal ando something about jobs in this country, I'start right on day one saying let's work to change this visa policy, not to change the security, just to get the consulate officers out there that generate $1 million in fees a person.	N
It's just about trying as haras we can to make this country competitive with what we have.	N
AnI know it's a lot that I've laiout here, but I truly believe that's where we neeto go as a country with the Commerce Secretary.	N
Look, I don't want to make a big deal about this, but I have Senator Snowe anthen Senator DeMint.	N
I appreciate your willingness to serve, anI really have no question about your credentials.	D
My question is about the environment you'll be working in, anwhether or not you'll have the courage to speak up against some of the most anti- business policies I think we've ever seen in our country.	N
As Senator Isakson already mentioned, the National Labor Relations Board, the Acting General Counsel, who has been appointeby Obama to be the General Counsel, has accuseyou as well as Bill Daley, Chief of Staff for the President, of breaking the law.	N
They're forcing a major American company to spenmillions of dollars anput thousands of jobs on holfor what is an unprecedenteviolation of a company's ability to locate an expansion facility anywhere they want.	N
As Senator Toomey has said, there's a lot of rhetoric about free trade, but when the agreements are supposeto be sent over, they're not sent over, anone excuse after another.	N
Thousands of jobs, probably billions of dollars of investment, are being sidetrackein the telecommunications business, because the FCC is violating Congressional direction ancourt orders to move aheaanregulate the Internet in a way that makes investors hesitant.	N
With the EPA, it's just amazing, hearing from the companies that come through my office, whether they're in manufacturing or utilities or mining, the absurregulations angray areas that are being created.	N
Of course, banks are afraito make loans, because of the regulators hanging over their shoulders.	N
I woulnot be Commerce Secretary in an Administration that has taken all these positions.	N
One thing the Constitution says is that the Federal Government shoulfacilitate interstate commerce.	N
Obviously, these are two important positions, anI, too, hathe opportunity anthe pleasure yesterday to meet with the nominee, Mr. Bryson, as Secretary of Commerce.	N
Anof course, I know Mr. Garcia from his days as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans anAtmosphere, as well as deputy administrator to NOAA.	D
There's no doubt Mr. Bryson has a very extensive backgrounin the corporate arena, as CEO of Edison International.	D
AnI do believe that he has an appreciation for the paramount value of job creation in the private sector, anthat it's absolutely a prerequisite to our economic well-being, ancentral to revitalizing the economic conditions of this country.	D
I also want to echo what Senator Kerry saiwith respect to Mr. Garcia, because I think it's important for the fisheries industry to make sure that we're not imposing burdensome regulations on an industry that is struggling to survive.	N
We have to design regulations that are important to the fishing communities anto the fishermen as well as to rebuilding the species.	N
Mr. Bryson, Mr. Garcia, do you still want this job after-- Let me just say, I really didn't have opening comments, so I'll just be very brief anjust say that, one, I'm looking forwarto working with both of you, but especially from Alaska's perspective, as we're very prouof our fisheries.	N
They're sustainable, they're growing, they're a huge export opportunity for this country through wise management ancooperation anwork with the Commerce Department over the years.	N
Even though we've haour friction at times with NOAA anthe Commerce Department, we have createan incredible opportunity in a sense of fisheries, from our perspective in Alaska, which now manages 60 percent of the live catch of this country.	N
Anso we think we have examples anexpertise that can be sharearounthe country on how to maximize the fishery opportunities that are not as great in certain parts of the country.	N
Also, Alaska is a net exporter, $4.2 billion in commodities last year, up almost 30 percent.	N
But at the same time, we survive on our own, in a lot of ways, in the sense of our export opportunities.	N
Ana lot of the work you do anyou will do as dealing with fisheries, tourism, export, international trade, that's a lot of Alaska.	N
It was a decade of neglect by many people throughout Congress anthroughout this country.	N
I think that's the stress point that everyone has here, that jobs are the most important piece of the equation.	N
So how you take it to the next level is going to be critical, because we have createjobs.	N
They may not be as robust as we woullike, but we're at the great recession, which is the equivalent, if we missea couple notches in 2009, it would've been the Great Depression.	N
But now we have to take it to the next level, anI think that's what we're looking for anlooking towaryou to do, as well as others of the President's economic Cabinet, because with your work, it's going to help to determine a long-term future.	N
I just gave you statistics from a state that understands what it's like to not just work within our borders but globally anunderstands that there is business beyonour borders, ansometimes you have to just bite the bullet anget moving.	N
AnI think your business experience is going to be critical, anI think you have a bureaucratic system over there.	D
AnNOAA plays a role in making sure that we move forwarin oil angas exploration in the Arctic anwhat can be done there in the most environmentally sounway, but recognize that it's a critical piece of our commerce in the future.	N
Two, get in there with a very positive attitude, because where we are today anwhere we were 2 years ago is day annight.	N
But we have a lot of opportunity aheaof us, anyou're going to be part of that equation.	N
AnI want to thank you for your public service anyour willingness to serve, anI look forwarto hearing from the witness.	D
We've got to have that voice to get back the $2.5 trillion just sitting on balance sheets, to give them the confidence to get reinvestein our country.	N
I personally believe the single biggest job creation entity, bigger than anything the Commerce Department or, candidly, anything we will do here, woulbe putting a long-	N
Anfor an Administration that has been criticized, not always appropriately, of not having enough people with senior business experience at the top level, my hope is that you will get this job anbe that advocate for the private sector, be that advocate for the business community, recognize that we've got to reaa balance sheet anget our nation's balance sheet back in order, anget this job engine that has improvekickeinto high gear.	N
Mr. Chairman, I will follow in the footsteps of my senior Senator from Arkansas ango aheaanyielback my time, in the interests of getting the rest of the hearing going.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman anSenator Hutchison, for holding today's hearing to consider these two nominations.	N
It's been nearly a year since Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner publishean op-ein the New York Times entitled, ``Welcome to the Recovery,'' an op-ethat in retrospect seems to have been a flaweprediction, to put it mildly.	N
The economy shoulbe roaring back by now, but insteait's still struggling, anthe unemployment rate is 9.1 percent as of June 3.	N
Anhas already been noteby some of my colleagues, excessive corporate taxes anneedless regulations are preventing the creation of jobs anseverely limiting economic growth in the country.	N
With all of these problems, it is important--critically important, actually--that we have a Secretary of Commerce who has a strong recorof accomplishment in creating jobs in the private sector, someone who knows the challenges anhow to overcome the barriers the private sector faces in creating jobs.	N
Anthere are aspects of Mr. Bryson's recorthat I think are very impressive in some circles.	N
There are some concerns I have, including his support for the job-killing cap-and-trade proposal.	N
Anso, you know, I'm anxious to hear from him about the steps that he thinks we neeto be taking to get the country back on track anget the economy back on track.	N
But I will just simply echo what my colleagues have said, Mr. Chairman, anreiterate, the Commerce Secretary has got to be a strong advocate for trade anopen markets for America's farmers anmanufacturers.	N
AnI signea letter, along with I think most of my Republican colleagues, to Majority Leader Reiback in March, stating that we woulwithholsupport for trade-relatenominees, including Commerce Secretary, until the Administration submits the pending free trade agreements to Congress for their consideration.	N
It's been over 3 months since that letter was sent, anthe Administration has still not committeto a specific timetable for implementing those agreements.	N
AnI believe I speak for a goonumber of those in our caucus when I say that it's going to be difficult for Republicans to support Mr. Bryson's nomination until the Administration submits those free trade agreements.	N
They are vital, vital to farmers anranchers in my state, anvital to our economic recovery.	N
Anjust to put a fine point on that, in 2008, the market share that we hain Colombia of corn, wheat, ansoybeans was 81 percent.	N
The vacuum has been filleby other countries who continue to sign bilateral trade agreements with these three countries.	N
AnI appreciate both Mr. Bryson anMr. Garcia being here today anlook forwarto hearing their testimony anthe steps they intento get the economy back on track.	N
Well, first let me say that I am pleasethat the nominee for Commerce Secretary has habusiness experience, anI think the President needs more people arounhim with business experience, anyou fulfill that role.	D
AnI do hope that what you saiin your opening statement, which is that you will be a cheerleader anadvocate for the regulatory reform that we all agree needs to be done, but which, frankly, has not been done so far, you will fill that role.	N
Now, along the lines of what the Chairman has started, with the coal industry, I have concerns about some of the things you have sairegarding energy regulations.	N
Anin a speech where you came out for cap-and-trade legislation, you saithat it is a tax, anthat regulations that penalize energy producers for producing more energy than needeby the government were the best way to reduce energy consumption angreenhouse gases.	N
So, the question is, having talketo so many business people, anthe cost of energy being one of their toughest issues anone of their biggest concerns, are you anti-energy?	N
Are you for taxing energy--raising the cost, anletting that have the effect of hurting our businesses, while gaining the purporteresult of having more investment in other forms of energy?	N
Do you think the corporate tax rate in America, being the seconhighest on the globe, is too high?	N
Anare you going to advocate for lowering the corporate tax rate to make us more competitive, including energy industries?	N
Do you think the stretch that the NLRB is making to try to keep Boeing from choosing where it manufactures its products is the overreach of regulation?	N
AnI hope that, because of your experience, not only doing what's right for jobs in America, but also unabashedly representing the shareholders, for whom you hola trust, that you will speak out against that kinof overreach that is unprecedented, really.	D
AnI hope when you're confirmethat you will take that on as the spokesman for business ancommerce in our country, that we've got to stop this.	N
Anif you will be the spokesman that you have saiyou will be, this shoulbe Exhibit A.	N
Senator Lautenberg.--the inference that it's rule anregulation that are killing business, is baloney, you'll forgive me.	N
Anthe company that you were associatewith, the Edison Electric, the company I was associatewith, you're going to have 42,000 employees, I think it is, the number in Commerce.	N
The company I startewith--two guys, four working people, now has 45,000 employees that--we workefrom scratch, anwe built an incredible company, with the best recorfor growth of any company in America--10 percent or better.	N
So, I submit to you--a little more confidence in your experience anyour ability, anan ability to make decisions.	D
When you're here, you're sitting before a jury, anyou have to present those things that you think are going to help grow our commercial opportunities at home anabroad.	N
So, I woullook to you to be able to stir up your belief in things, anget the job done.	N
And, if you were to be able to get this job, to lanthis one, then you will have made a great contribution to America's well-being.	N
We know that changes in ocean chemistry causeby carbon dioxide will affect our foosupply, the health of our oceans.	N
Now, I wrote a provision that became law in 2009 requiring NOAA to leaan interagency effort to study the effects of ocean acidification.	N
Woulyou say here that you're going to continue the administration's commitment to a better understanding in addressing this growing point resulting from a change in temperatures--or whatever the causes are--but, to make sure that we try to restructure these things so that we don't lose the opportunity that comes from an ocean that's pure, that has coral alive, that is a place where fish ansea life gets its growing strength?	N
And, with coral out of existence, the fish anthe other sea life doesn't have a chance to fina place to propagate andevelop.	N
And, I certainly respect anappreciate what both of you have done--what you've done a National Geographic; anwhat you've done in your career, Mr. Bryson.	D
Anit goes well beyonenergy executive, because of the boards you've serveon anall the other things you've done.	D
I have, he's made a lot more business decisions than I have, anI have a lot of respect for him.	D
Were you, you were on the boarwhen they made the decision to locate the new facility in South Carolina, then?	N
I think it, the message to everybody--you know, I'm from Missouri, where we have a lot of Boeing employees.	N
But, I think one of the messages here is, if you're in a right-to-work state, or you're coming to the UniteStates for the first time, until this is settled, that may be one reason not to come to Missouri, because you can't move, you can't put your seconlocation somewhere that's not part of that first location in a non-right-to-work state.	N
I just think this is one of the areas where a Secretary of Commerce--if you're not fighting this attitude in any administration, nobody is.	N
Whether it's in regulatory efforts, or the taxing efforts, or what the utility bill might be, all of those become reasons not to take a risk.	N
It's a lot easier to not put your money on the table to see if you can lose it, than it is to put it on the table ansee if you can lose it.	N
Anwhether it's the EPA or--I agree with Senator Hutchison, that the, this NLRB rule is something that, if somehow the Congress wanteto enact this as a new national standard, that's one thing--anI wouldn't be for it--but, to have these rulemaking agencies think they can make these big stretches into new areas of law is a real concern.	N
Anit stands against the number one priority of the government of the country today, which shoulbe private sector job creation.	N
And, I mean, as a member of that board, do you have particular concerns about how that decision by your board, well taken anwell entereinto, has createthis new set of problems?	N
Anyou know how a little difference makes the difference in whether you make the decision or not.	N
And, in my view, the advocacy of the risk-rewarphilosophy of capitalism is a key job of the Secretary of Commerce.	N
If you don't understanrisk-reward, andon't respect it as a driving component of growing the economy, the economy doesn't grow.	N
AnI think that's a lot of what we're seeing right now, is, this lack of certainty creates incredible hesitancy, which means nobody takes a chance.	N
If nobody takes a chance, other people don't get an opportunity that that chance woulhave providefor them.	N
I am concerneabout a sense that the California model is the right utility model for us to follow.	N
not only they don't make us competitive, they drive these jobs to countries that care a whole lot less about what comes out of the smokestack than we do.	N
Anso, the overall goal, environmental goal, is actually set back, insteaof moveforward, by policies that drive jobs from our country to other countries.	N
Let's go back to what I was discussing earlier, because I think it is so paramount in focusing on job creation.	N
Anin fact, yesterday I was trying to describe an initiative that I haofferetwo ana half years ago, to your predecessor, which was to have a job creation coordinator because of the disparate organizations anstructures within the Commerce Department, to centralize the focus anbring everybody forwarin a coordinated, synchronizefashion.	N
When I look at the overall picture of what the Commerce mission is, anwhat the reality is of the economy today, they're totally misaligned.	N
In fact, we are at a point where, since January of 2009 unemployment has fallen below 9 percent for 5 months only.	N
I mean, we know what we have to create--285,000 jobs a month in the next 5 years to get back to pre-recession levels of 2007.	N
If you look at your mission to strengthen the international economic position of the UniteStates, less that 1 percent of U.S. businesses engage in exporting.	N
If you look at your mission to promote aggressive business policies that help America's businesses anentrepreneurs, we talk about the cost of regulations for small employers.	N
A March 2011 report by the Manufacturing Institute on education reform saiat the height of the recession, 32 percent of manufacturers reportethey hajobs going unfilled.	N
Back in 1981, when we first passethe Research anDevelopment Tax Credit bill--anI was in the House at that time--the UniteStates of America hathe most generous tax treatment for research among all of the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation anDevelopment, the OECD.	N
That's why you have an opportunity to do something so important for the President, anmost especially, for the country, anusing the resources of your Department to bring it forward.	N
As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I cannot underscore enough the difficulty anthe barriers that regulations present to small businesses anlarge businesses alike.	N
I have talketo businesses of all sizes, all across America and, of course, including my own in Maine.	N
When people say it doesn't matter--because I've arguethis issue on the Floor, anthere's a lot of resistance to the notion of regulatory reform.	N
Just in this state of California, regulations--just on the state level--cost $177 billion a year, or $493 billion, if you count the indirect costs.	N
Anthink about the onerous burden that presents to businesses of all sizes across this country.	N
That's why I hope you will use your voice anthe force of the office on the whole issue of regulations, anto the President.	N
So, there's no one person in the offices of the Commerce Department who is taskewith analyzing anassessing the impact overall of these regulations on businesses.	N
So, I woulurge you to consider that, anto make sure that you drive that initiative, because it's so critically important.	N
AnI applauyou, because I think that is going to be really important at a time that that voice needs to be hearhere at the Federal level, anmost especially, from the department that you will represent.	N
Anit's, anall my other concerns have been outlinehere today in the questions anin the opening statements.	N
But, just briefly, again, I hope something you will focus on, both of you will focus on, anthat is the issue of our broken visa process that we have here in the country.	N
We can't be the only country in the worlthat doesn't have them andoesn't enforce them.	N
On the other hand, it's important to note that our broken visa process is hurting our economy in multiple ways.	N
Certainly, folks in the tourism industry will tell you that our market share in tourism is suffering from the inability to get folks to come here.	N
I think people in business will tell you they're struggling to get buyers into their trade shows or into their warehouses anplaces of interest.	N
Entrepreneurial--anwe shoulbe looking anactively searching for ways to bring entrepreneurs to this country to invest ancreate countries--	N
Certainly, folks in your home state, in California anin other places, will tell you that in the high-	N
So, certainly, we have some deficiencies in the visa programs that I hope can be addressefrom a pro-business perspective.	N
AnI hope that both of you will make that a priority in your time that--we discussethat.	N
We have many workers that I think couldo better if they were focusemore on retraining in technical colleges anthose kinds of things.	N
AnI think that our education system needs to adjust to this new economy, where it's not just your grandpa's Vo-Tech anymore, that, actually, people who are getting 2-year degrees are doing incredibly better than some people that are getting 4-year degrees.	N
And, that our high schools shoulbe working better with the technical schools in terms of that focus.	N
Coulyou comment on that, anhow the Department of Commerce coulhelp workers learn new skills when they get laioff, or there are less jobs in the industry that they're in?	N
The, I have founthat in certain areas of our state, like northern Minnesota--beautiful resort areas--they're at a competitive disadvantage, because the resorts in Canada have more Internet access.	N
So, of course, people are booking there insteaof going to GranMoray, or some of the beautiful communities on the north shore.	N
And, coulyou just briefly talk--I know Senator Kerry has to get to the vote--about your commitment to the broadbanexpansion in this country?	N
I've been watching on the--but I suppose, since you're going to be the deputy, you can just say ``ditto'' to everything.	N
I've been listening, actually, back in my office, anI heara number of my colleagues, particularly, secretary--	N
secretary--Senator Blunt ansome others refer to tax rates, anto the lack of certainty.	N
AnI woulsay to my friends on the other side of the isle--there's nobody here now, obviously, anyou don't have to answer this--but, it woulhelp a lot to provide certainty if we coulget a little less ideological rigidity, anget an agreement on the budget fast.	N
Anthe idea of turning our heads on the experts' predictions that we neeto get something like $4 trillion of savings--about $3 trillion out of policy an$1 trillion out of debt--anthat everything they're talking about now fall shy of that, the idea that anybody's living up to a responsible challenge here, without revenue, is simply absurd.	N
But, I will say, as my colleagues talk about certainty--the certainty we coulsento the marketplace if we got a deal that was reasonable anrational, as we diunder President Reagan.	N
When President Reagan, for whom Defense cuts were an anathema, agreeto have 50 percent of the sequestration come out of Defense, an50 percent came out of entitlements andomestic discretionary.	N
What we're doing here, arounhere, right now is simply not rational, anI wish our colleagues were here, because I wouldn't hesitate to say this if they were.	N
Anwe neeto put it on the table anget it done, because your task is going to be 20 times harder if we're struggling to get this already fragile economy moving, anwe're not investing in infrastructure--which hasn't been talkeabout here today.	N
We're not investing in, the sort of the basics of our, to break that down, air control system, our rail, or transit, all these things that matter in getting products to the marketplace.	N
The other thing I want to straighten out is, I'm kinof tireof hearing about the odorous tax rates that corporations are paying in America, when in fact they don't pay those rates.	N
The effective tax rate in the UniteStates among OECD countries--about 30 nations--is about 14 to 18--midway to less than midway.	N
AnI think people, you know, I mean, you know, John Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''	N
Ana lot of folks arounhere in Washington keep making them up, or sticking with their own facts.	N
Now, as I saiearlier, there are a lot of issues that fall before this committee, anthere are a lot of things--I wear the hat as the Chair of the Communications Technology Subcommittee, anwe are working on privacy, anthe whole information management issue, anthere's a lot to talk to you about on that.	N
Fishing in New Englanas a whole, from Maine all the way down through New York, is an old-time, long-standing way of making a living, anit's a huge part of our culture anhistory, anour tourism, anit's a big thing.	N
We have two of the largest ports in the Nation for the landing of fish, in Gloucester anin New Bedford.	N
Anso, but, the relationship--under the Bush administration there were some excesses in terms of the regulatory process that are still not yet rectifiecompletely.	N
Anthey've moved, anmade a number of different steps to try to builthe relationship anconfidence of our fishermen.	N
So, number one, I want to ask you, will you commit to coming up to our state, spena day, half a day, whatever you can with us, to meet with our fishermen, bring people together, anlisten to them, anhelp us work through--I think one of the best things we can do--Congressman Frank, Congressman Tierney, others, have proposethis also--that we create a task force that looks at the way in which regulations have been applied, ansee if we can't fina better, more simple, more understandable, easier way of regulating the fisheries so that the fishermen have confidence that the decisions are being baseon science, ancommon sense at the same time?	N
I know you've got a lot of things to, you know, when you get sworn in, and, to get going on.	N
The seconthing is, woulyou be willing to establish, I guess under your own aegis, if you were to undertake to put together this task force--not just come anvisit, but investigate both the economic anregulatory issues.	N
One of the problems we've hais, the Governor submitteimportant data to the Secretary, anthere are some difficulties in the regulatory interpretation.	N
Maybe it doesn't, the law doesn't always make sense, as you know from law school anfrom practice.	N
And, I'just like to get a commitment from you that we can really work to continue the process that Secretary Locke put in place, anmake progress.	N
Because we have the vote on, I neeto get there annot keep the vote from being--the vote clock has expired, so I have to magically get there with no time left ancast my vote.	N
So, you are, Secretary-designates anUnder Secretary- designates, you are saveby the votes here in the U.S. Senate.	N
The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, anTransportation will come to order, anI'like to thank our witness for being here, Mr. Huerta, who is the nominee to be the FAA Administrator anour colleague from the Committee Senator Boxer.	N
I'm presiding at the request of the chairman of the full Committee, who is here, anI'm going to go aheaanmake an opening statement.	N
Madam Chairman, may I ask a point--make a point of personal privilege, a request to my friends?	N
I'm in the middle of literally 24-7 negotiations on the highway bill anit's going well, anI'm due to meet with Chairman Mica.	N
Do you minif I just gave one ana half minutes of praise for this wonderful man anthen charge out the door?	N
Well, it's going to turn to you anSenator Rockefeller momentarily to resolve the last few issues.	N
So I will ask unanimous consent to place my entire statement into the recorat this time anI will summarize.	N
I'm so pleasewith the nomination of Mr. Michael Huerta to be Administrator of the FAA, anI want to congratulate Michael anhis family.	N
So this is a testegentleman, anthe leadership roles he playeat the Port of San Francisco, at the Salt Lake City Olympics, as chief of staff for the Secretary of Transportation under the Clinton Administration, will serve him well.	D
So in closing, I want to just note anpay tribute to a number of families, family members of victims of the tragic crash of Flight 3407 near Buffalo in 2010.	N
They're here in the audience today, anthey're here to reminus all of what is at stake when it comes to the neefor adequate safety regulations.	D
I know Mr. Huerta carries that responsibility very close to his heart, anI believe his breadth of experience anleadership make him an excellent choice to fill the role of Administrator at the FAA.	D
I want to thank my friends on the Committee, all of you, for this opportunity, anI look forwarto a swift confirmation.	N
Certainly NextGen is the biggest thing on your plate anwe all are going to want to know what the setbacks are anhow you're going to proceeforward.	N
Number one is the U.S. Office of Special Counsel wrote to Congress raising concerns about ongoing safety lapses at the FAA, some of which we certainly have reaabout in the newspapers with the air traffic controllers.	N
The counsel strongly recommendethat more rigorous oversight measures be put in place at the Department anthe FAA.	N
Second, the current Federal budget realities require every agency to have cost-cutting measures, anI will want to hear what you're doing in that regard.	N
So with that, let me say that I think you have steppein at a big time at the FAA anyou have kept the trains running on time, so I will look forwarto hearing your testimony anthen asking you a few questions.	N
Again, Mr. Huerta, thank you for your willingness to serve anthank you for your testimony this morning.	N
There are several rulemakings that are requireunder the FAA Extension Act of 2010 ansome of those rulemakings for new flight anduty time rules have been completeanothers haven't.	N
In the hearings that we hain the aftermath of the Colgan 3407 flight, one of the issues identifiewas the shortcoming of pilot training anco-pilot training.	N
That was one of the issues in the Colgan Air case, the amount of time in commuting, pilots showing up after long distance travel.	N
What else can we do to address some of these issues, given that, obviously, we want to implement the right rules, but 2013 is a long time.	N
Well, let me start with the Office of Special Counsel analso the relatively large number, according to the Special Counsel, of whistleblowers at the FAA.	N
What oversight measures are you putting in place in response to that report, or what measures are you taking to assure that there is some way to assure that an air traffic controller isn't taking a nap on the job or leaving the tower?	N
Mr. Huerta, one of the things that you reaabout anhear about are how difficult it is to discipline anfire if necessary a Federal employee because there are so many requirements anit's a bureaucratic tough situation.	N
All of us have--well, not all of us, but I've certainly been in a Federal agency myself anI know there are a lot of rules ansometimes it's been difficult even if someone was not doing their job anhaall the requirements.	N
essential personnel, like an air traffic controller or a mechanic, have you hatrouble with the bureaucratic constraints or union activity that woulkeep you from taking an action that you felt is necessary to assure that a person not doing the job is not able to stay on the job?	N
I do have another quick question, anthat is what steps are you taking to live within the lower budgets that we're going to have across the boaruntil we get the deficits down anthe debt under control?	N
What measures are you taking that woulsuggest that you couldo things more efficiently anthat you're doing the part for your agency?	N
Thank you, anI just want to go over the order of members because people have come in anout of the hearing room.	N
We'll next call on Senator Thune, who's the ranking member on the Subcommittee, followeby Senator Begich, if Senator Boxer reappears, then Senator Lautenberg, then my other colleagues.	N
I want to thank you anthe Ranking Member for holding the confirmation hearing today, anMr. Huerta for appearing before the Committee as the nominee to be the next Administrator of the FAA.	N
I think we have to acknowledge that FAA operates the largest ansafest air space system in the world.	N
As we know, since the mid-1990s the commercial air carrier accident rate has fallen by nearly 80 percent.	N
Achieving that low of a U.S. air carrier accident rate while transporting almost 800 million passengers per year is no simple feat.	N
But, having saithat, even with the high rate of safety, improvements can be made, anlast month's letter from the Office of Special Counsel, which cite178 FAA disclosures, of which 97 were safety-related, is a startling reminder that safety's got to be a top priority.	N
The agency faces several other future challenges, including reducing regulatory burdens, streamlining its operations, maintaining professionalism in its work force, animplementing the recently enacteFAA Modernization anReform Act.	N
So I appreciate, Mr. Huerta, hearing from you about your ideas on how to address those many challenges.	N
We have a bill, Senate bill 1956, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act that Senator McCaskill anI anothers have introduced, which gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure America's aviation operators are not penalizeby any system unilaterally imposeby the EU.	N
We haa hearing about this recently in front of this committee anI'm wondering what your thoughts are about whether this legislation might help you in your negotiations with the European Union.	N
Wouldn't having a legislative solution give you additional leverage in confronting the Europeans on this issue andealing with it?	N
At the same time, you've got this thing already in effect, essentially, anlots of American air carriers covereby it anin many cases having to pass those costs on.	N
It seems to me at least that the legislation woulat least provide temporary relief from this until such time as you can work through the appropriate forum, if that's ICAO, to get the right resolution in place.	N
So it just seems to me at least that it gives you one more piece of ammunition, one more tool, if you will, in dealing with the EU if you haCongress on the recorangiving our air carriers in this country some relief from what is an unfair violation of international law ansovereignty of the UniteStates.	N
There is a recent IG report that highlightethat the FAA has not yet establishetotal program cost, schedule, or performance baseline for all of the six NextGen transformational programs.	N
When does the agency plan to do this, since without baselining we will not have complete information about when these programs will be completed, what they will deliver, anhow much they're going to cost the American taxpayer?	N
The other three of the six that you saithat have not--that are not baselined, when do you expect?	N
As you know, the general aviation community from my State anSenator Thune's, others, it's very important, the rural aspect of it.	N
Our concern is, anas you know, FAA is ultimately responsible for certifying the type of gas that goes into aviation or into airplanes.	N
We are--I want to make it very clear that we are hopeful that there are no moves by EPA or FAA to phaseout avgas until there is truly an appropriate aneconomical drop-in substitute fuel.	N
When we convertea much higher level of leadegas to unleaded, which was our vehicles, it took many, many, many years to do that.	N
I'm worriethat EPA has a different view of life here, that they can flip the switch anmake it all magic.	N
I'm glathat you have made the statement you just said, because I think you understanthe FAA component of this anthe aviation component of this.	N
Will you keep us, at least our office, informeif there are some milestones occurring that we neeto be aware of, because I guarantee you we'll hear very quickly in Alaska anwe want to make sure we're on top of this issue.	N
The administration in the 2013 budget hathe $100 user fee on GA, general aviation users.	N
It's going to create another bureaucracy within FAA, anthe reality is we already have a system that general aviation supports analways works with FAA on.	N
I know it's a budget issue anI'm sure OMB has their views on it, but from a practical implication of how you implement it, it seems like it's creating another system that we don't neewhen we have a user fee tax that people have been accustometo anhave been supportive in the past of adjusting when necessary.	N
I think the general aviation folks, aviation in general, I think always are happy to--if there is a process anthey know the value comes back to the users in this case, they're always willing to sit down anwork these issues out.	N
Do you--I just want to follow up on what Senator Thune talkeabout on NextGen, if I can, anthat is just very quickly, anthat is you talkeabout the baselines, three more to go.	N
If you were to say--if you coulgive a percentage of where do you think you're at with full implementation of NextGen in the level that we haaskefor in the FAA reauthorization bill, where woulyou say we are? 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent?	N
I know there are multiple pieces, but if you coultake a 30,000 view looking down, where do you think we're at?	N
I'll look forwarto supporting you in the final, but I just want to say thank you very much for coming here.	N
You were askea question some minutes ago about what kinof performance we might expect if there is less funding.	N
The FAA authorization which was signeinto law earlier this year exempts certain NextGen projects from environmental review.	N
The exemption has raiseconcerns in my region that there will be potentially more noise as a result of NextGen implementation.	N
That's critical, anthat's a complaint that we hear about regularly anreally in some instances very angrily, as you can imagine.	N
That is, I'like your commitment that you're going to devote the time anenergy to solving the Newark air traffic control problem that we wrestle with constantly.	N
As you anI talkeabout, as I saiwhen we visitethe other day, probably harto fina group of 535 people that fly more or think they're more experts in air traffic, air travel, than Members of Congress.	N
But I've been impresseby the way you've been doing it anhope that moving permanently into the position allows you to finalize some things even in a better way.	N
On the pilot flight rule, at one point it looketo me like the FAA was moving towarhaving the same flight rules for passenger pilots as cargo pilots, which I didn't think was necessary.	N
Is that the position the FAA will continue to have, that there's a different--the cargo pilots are under the rules that they've been working under anyou're moving the passenger pilots to other rules; is that the status?	N
But you're not requiring them--you're requiring them to abide by the provisions of the previous rules, right?	N
On the cost of that, I noticethere was a wide discrepancy--I think the FAA thought that cargo companies complying with the rule woulcost about $30 million anthey thought $600 million.	N
Have you lookemore carefully at that cost-benefit, how they coulhave that big a number, how the numbers coulbe that widely divergent?	N
I'like to--this cost-benefit--I think there are going to be more anmore pressures on cost-benefit generally as regulation is becoming a bigger anbigger concern at all levels.	N
On the FAA training anconference center, there's language in the Senate appropriations bill that directs the FAA to continue to pursue new leasespace for that center.	N
What's your ongoing plan for how to look at the future of how you're going to conduct those training facilities, moving people in anout of one training facility to get their training?	N
I do know that in Kansas City, which bifor this, they hainvestelots of money in that bid, which is also something that the FAA needs to think about.	N
When you go out for bianyou have competitive bidders making substantial investments to try to make that work, anthen just decide, well, maybe that's not what we needed, you probably ought to pull that trigger when you're a little more sure of where you're headed, though economic circumstances clearly are different than they may have been a handful of years ago when that discussion coulhave started.	N
Will you make a decision on whether to go for bids that include training or whether to go for bids that only include facilities at some point, do you think?	N
In a sense, it just depends on who contracts with them, you or the successful bidder for the training?	N
We're a global marketplace, anit's really important that this is done in a timely fashion.	N
Can you comment a little bit on perhaps some ideas that you have how we can do a better job of that in the future, anany proposals that you've got in solving that problem?	N
You know, we talkea lot about jobs anthe economy, which we can't talk too much about it.	N
In relation to that, I understanthat we're moving more towara risk-basesafety oversight.	N
Woulcertification be one of those things that either is going to be done in that way more or something to be considerein that regard?	N
Again, it does seem like--anI think we're really saying the same thing--that with the certification process, that some things people neeto devote more time to than other things.	N
Anthank you so much, Acting Administrator Huerta, for being here today ananswering our questions in a straightforwarmanner.	N
Additionally, smaller airports, which are central to rural commerce--we have a lot of them in my state--often struggle to get the funds needefor infrastructure updates for airports anrunways.	N
The local match requirement for small airport projects recently doublefrom 5 to 10 percent.	N
I'm concerneabout the effect that this new requirement woulforce--that it coulforce small airports, which in the scheme of things aren't as small as some, like the one we have in Duluth, anelsewhere, to delay completion of critical infrastructure projects that were under way before the higher local match went into effect.	N
I don't think it's fair to change the rules midstream, anI hope you'll work to fina way to help these airports complete their projects, because it's obviously very important.	N
You can't just change the rules midstream anthen expect everything to keep going as planned.	N
So I'm going to be in Duluth tomorrow--we've hasome major flooding up there--anwas just wondering what I can tell them about this.	N
Then also I hope you can commit to making sure that colweather airports, such as the ones you just discussed, Bemidji, Duluth, get the flexibility they neeto complete infrastructure improvements with the short construction season issue.	N
This is, again, they're waiting for awardefunds to be releaseso they can try to get this construction done through the summer season.	N
Otherwise I'm going to make you come to Duluth when it's 20 below zero ando construction.	N
I understanthat in the final order of the new regulations that it only applieto commercial pilots.	N
I know Senator Cantwell toucheon this, anthat some pilots commute across the country to their hubs anwe have the issue where the FAA isn't following through with this request from the Inspector General about this particular commuting issue.	N
I was failing to watch the clock anyou weren't rude at all, anI was taking time that shoulhave gone to others andid.	N
What I was going to ask you about was on--we talkeabout the Columbia, Missouri, airport the other day.	N
On these airports like that, that have moveoff Essential Air Service, are there things that the FAA can do to encourage their ability to stay off Essential Air Service?	N
Have you got some ideas there of ways that those kinds of airports that neeto be planning for more travelers anmore service coulget some assistance in doing that?	N
I think as these airports move to where they're not getting the Essential Air Service support, things that we can do to help them stay there are really beneficial anmake money.	N
As long as we have an Essential Air Service program, when we can help people stay off of it, it's harto imagine that that's not a better investment than the VSA support that we normally woulgive those same airports.	N
What I neeto do now is, because we've got--Senator Klobuchar, who's finishing her thirbook over there, we----	N
So what I'like to do, with your forbearance, is simply to recess this for a couple of minutes.	N
It is really a pleasure to be here this afternoon with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Hagan.	N
I want to thank you for holding quickly this important hearing anfor the opportunity to introduce a frienanthe Mayor of Charlotte, Anthony Foxx.	N
First, I want to publicly thank him for his commitment anhis willingness to serve in this capacity.	D
I know it can't be easy to leave behinthe beauty of North Carolina to come to Washington anto take on the challenges that come with this position.	N
I understanit is not the easiest transition, so I especially want to thank his wife, Samara, anhis two children, Hillary anZachary, for the support that they continue to give to him in what has been a very quick life of public service.	N
Anthony's leadership anhis recorof service has brought him before you today, anI am confident that he will serve our nation in the same manner that he servethe people of North Carolina, specifically the city of Charlotte.	D
A homegrown talent, Anthony was born in Charlotte, where he attendeWest Charlotte High School before moving on to Davidson College.	D
While in undergrad, Anthony serveas student body president, the first African-American to do so at Davidson.	D
His passion for public service awardehim the Root-Tilden Scholarship to study law at New York University.	D
Prior to joining DesignLine as Deputy General Counsel in 2009, Anthony workeas a Litigation Attorney at Hunton anWilliams.	D
He has the distinction of serving in all three branches of the Federal Government: as a law clerk on the UniteStates Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a trial attorney for the Civil Rights Division of the UniteStates Justice Department, ana staff counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives on the Judiciary.	D
Anthony began his political career in 2005 with his election to the city council as an at-large representative anservetwo terms before being electeMayor on November 3, 2009.	D
Anas mayor, Mayor Foxx has kept the charge of meeting anstaying aheaof the needs of a major metropolitan area.	D
As mayor, he has done an outstanding job of building stronger relationships with state anFederal leaders to meet the infrastructure needs of a growing metropolitan area.	D
I commenthe president for looking towarNorth Carolina for this kinof leadership, anI urge my colleagues to offer him their full consideration.	D
Chairman Rockefeller anRanking Member Thune anall of the members of the Committee, it certainly is a pleasure to be here with my colleague, Senator Burr, so that we both can welcome anintroduce Anthony Foxx to you.	N
I also want to thank the Mayor's family for their steadfast service ancommitment while he has serveas Mayor of Charlotte anmovethrough this nomination process.	D
So I am honoreto have the opportunity to introduce a man who has been a tremendous asset to our entire state.	D
While it is going to be sato see him leave Charlotte anthe Charlotte government process, I am pleasethat when he is confirmethe entire country will benefit from Anthony Foxx's leadership as Secretary of Transportation.	D
He earnean undergraduate degree, as you have heard, in history from Davidson College in North Carolina andiblaze a trail as the school's first African-American student body president.	D
He receivea law degree from New York University anhas helpositions in all three branches of the Federal Government.	D
Beginning as a judicial clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Anthony Foxx went on to become a lawyer for the Department of Justice ancounsel for the House Judiciary Committee.	D
In 2005, he was electeas an at-large member of the Charlotte City Council, anduring his 4 years of service as councilman, he chairethe Transportation Committee anwas a member of the Economic Development anPlanning Committee.	D
Since 2009, he has serveas the mayor of Charlotte, one of our country's fastest-growing cities.	D
Given his experience anthe strength of his resume, it is harto believe that Anthony coulbe one of the youngest Cabinet secretaries in history.	D
Through his tireless efforts, he helpeattract ancreate more than 8,400 new jobs in the Charlotte area.	D
Most importantly, he has been a true champion of transportation aninfrastructure development, securing forward-looking investments in Charlotte's roads, airport, anmass transit.	D
Under his leadership, the I-485 has been approvefor expansion; he securefunding towarthe completion of the Blue Line Light Rail Extension Project; anoversaw the opening of a thirrunway at the Charlotte International Airport.	D
All of these projects occurreas we workeanas we are still working to climb out of the recession.	N
South End, which is a historic Charlotte neighborhoowhich saw the city's first railroaline back in the 1850s, is being revitalizewith the help of the LYNX light rail.	N
This neighborhoois now home to more than 750 small businesses an11 new residential developments.	N
Aninvestments at the Charlotte airport are establishing the city as an international hub.	N
With direct flights to London ansoon to Brazil, Charlotte anNorth Carolina are increasingly connecteto businesses across the world.	N
Anthe I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which has been a top priority for the state of North Carolina for many years, is finally moving forward.	N
Sixty thousanvehicles use one part of this roadway every day, anthat number is expecteto double by 2025.	N
The improvement project, which relieheavily on support from local leaders across the region, including Mayor Foxx, is expanding animproving the integral roadway so it can really meet the needs of businesses anresidents for years to come.	N
Anthony Foxx's direct experience working directly with transportation departments at the Federal, state, anlocal levels anhis proven recorof success make him well-prepared, Mr. Chairman, to serve as the next secretary of transportation.	D
I have workeclosely with Mayor Foxx during my time in Washington, anI have the utmost confidence that he will serve in this role with great distinction.	D
I thank him for his service anwillingness to step up when his service is needed, anI encourage a swift confirmation by this committee.	D
Now, I am not kicking you out, but I am offering you the opportunity to leave, because--unless you want to listen to John Thune anmyself speak.	N
Mayor Foxx, I have to say, I have been here on this committee for 26, 27-something years, anI have never seen a greater press crush in my entire life.	N
I want to congratulate you, Mayor Foxx, be you seateor not--anyou have to introduce your wife, for sure--on your nomination for the position of Secretary of the UniteStates Department of Transportation.	N
As Secretary LaHooso ably demonstrated, the job requires a deep understanding of the policy anthe political savvy to accomplish the administration's goals, all of which in an era of constraint which doesn't seem to relax.	N
Despite this, the department is taskewith implementing a large number of new safety mandates ansimultaneously presiding over a transportation infrastructure network in neeof significant animmediate investment.	N
The country's transportation network has been a critical factor in our long-term economic growth.	N
However, years of underinvesting in our roads, airports, air traffic control systems, rails, anports have left us with an overstrainetransportation system.	N
AnI think that is probably the greatest weak link in our national economic picture, only to get much worse.	N
I believe we are on the brink of losing our competitive edge in the global marketplace as a result.	N
The evidence is clear that this interconnectesystem was not built to withstanthe wear anthe tear that it is forceto endure today.	N
Instead, we have grown accustometo an ahoc approach to investing in our transportation network by using a grab bag of unrelatepay-	N
Too many seem content with this approach, but I certainly am not anI don't think you are.	N
Turning our backs on this growing problem ignores what we truly need, desperately neein this country: a strategic, long-term vision for rebuilding our transportation system in all of its forms.	N
We neeto take a harlook at what we neefrom our ports, rail, air, anhighway systems over the long term ancommit to making appropriate investments.	N
We must get away from overly siloed, programmatic funding mechanisms that don't allow for flexibility necessary to make strategic multimodal investments.	N
In short, we neeto rethink how we funtransportation in this country as we look, hopefully, towara future.	N
We all neeto come together--the Congress, the White House, anthe stakeholder community--antruly explore all options.	N
Now, anI shoultell you that we, the Commerce Committee, has now very much become a consumer affairs committee ana safety committee, looking out for little things that we sort of lookepast in years past.	N
Since becoming chairman, I really have workeon protection of people ansafety as a priority.	N
For transportation, I hope I have your commitment on this across the department, anI am sure I will.	N
While we have requirenew safety requirements across the air, rail, anhighway systems, the work has only just begun.	N
The department needs do everything in its power to implement these safety requirements in a timely way.	N
We are very gooat passing rules and, you know, legislation anthen others pass rules anregulations; then they never get implemented.	N
I am concerneabout delays we are seeing on some very important issues anworrieabout more.	N
Shoulyou be confirmed, I neeyour help in making sure that these new requirements are put in place as soon as possible.	N
On the aviation side, it has been a tough year, between the challenges involving the 787 ansequestration impacts.	N
Unfortunately, we face the same difficulties next year aninto the future until we come to our collective senses.	N
All of this has taken attention away from other key efforts, such as modernizing the air traffic control system, which is sort of the thing I care most about but get to talk least about because it has been pushedown the roaby the situation we are facewith.	N
I expect you to make a reneweeffort to focus the agency on implementing new pilot qualification antraining requirements.	N
Implementing the NextGen air traffic control system, as I indicated, is of personal importance for me.	N
The system is vital to the future of our air transportation network, anI will continue to make it a priority.	N
This will take communication antransparency from the department; it will take honesty anfrankness from us.	N
Before I turn this over to my distinguishefriend, Senator Thune, I shoulpoint out that, one, we have two votes at 4 o'clock.	N
Anthen on the questions, everybody will have 7-minute rounds rather than 5-minute rounds.	N
This hearing gives our committee the opportunity to perform one of the most important constitutional responsibilities provideto members of the UniteStates Senate, the power to give advice anconsent on the president's executive anjudicial nominees.	N
Today we are going to consider Mayor Anthony Foxx to be the 17th Secretary of Transportation.	N
Establishein 1967, the Department of Transportation employs approximately 53,000 full-time employees anhas over $72 billion in budget authority.	N
If confirmed, Mayor Foxx, not only will you be responsible for overseeing this important agency, but you will also be the principal advisor to the President on all matters relating to transportation.	D
I know most of the individuals here today understanwhat an important position this is for our country, but every American is directly affecteby our nation's transportation systems, including through personal anbusiness travel, employment, the interstate movement of the products we grow, manufacture, anpurchase, antheir impact on the overall health of our economy.	N
The average American family spends roughly 17 percent of their total budget on transportation-relatecosts, an$1.6 trillion, or almost 10 percent of the U.S. GDP, is compriseof transportation-relategoods anservices.	N
Even a rural state like my home state of South Dakota is directly impacteby the decisions made by the Secretary of Transportation.	N
For instance, the regulations produceby the DOT have a direct impact on the ability of Daktronics, an industry leader in electronic scoreboards andisplay systems locatein Brookings, South Dakota, to produce ansell dynamic message signs useon freeways anroadways to provide instructions, travel times, anroaconditions to motorists.	N
DOT components like the Federal Aviation Administration anthe Federal Highway Administration play an important role in maintaining a robust national airspace anhighway system to transport agriculture goods to market, enable tourists to visit South Dakota's many historic sites like Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, anthe Badlands, or enjoy our world-class pheasant hunting.	N
Anregulations placeon truck safety by another DOT agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, impact more than 20,000 individuals in South Dakota employeby the trucking industry.	N
The secretary's decisions also shape the role the Federal RailroaAdministration plays in ensuring our freight rail lines are safe so that South Dakota's agricultural goods can make it to market quickly anefficiently.	N
The position you are nominatefor is certainly an important one, anto be successful the administration anCongress will neeto work together to address the numerous transportation challenges we face ahead.	D
Mayor Foxx, I look forwarto hearing your testimony today anto learning about you anyour qualifications to be the next secretary of transportation.	N
Mayor Foxx, the oversight of the activities of government departments anagencies is a serious responsibility of all members of this committee.	N
If confirmed, do you pledge to give thorough antimely responses to requests for information another correspondence to all members of this committee?	N
I woullike to point out that there are several outstanding letters that I sent, along with the House Transportation anInfrastructure Chairman Shuster anwith Chairman Rockefeller, to the FAA anDOT that remain unanswered.	N
They are items that, in my view, neeto be fully answerebefore I can support your nomination being reportefrom the Committee.	N
Anso I just wanteto make sure that, in terms of the responsiveness of the department to the members of this committee, that we woulget your response on the recorin terms of your intentions in that regard.	N
Let me ask you, there was the big issue that came up here in the last few months in the way that the Department of Transportation anthe Federal Aviation Administration handlespending reductions as a result of the Budget Control Act.	N
The DOT anthe FAA haover a year to plan for implementation of reductions, but the poor planning resultein disruptions in FAA staffing andelays for passengers across the country.	N
The Budget Control Act is the law of the land, anunless a granbargain comes together, I think many of us agree that agency leaders shoulbe prepareto plan for the contingencies of budget caps in the Budget Control Act.	N
Anso my question is: what experiences have equippeyou to plan towardelivering safe anefficient air traffic control services within the current budgetary realities?	N
Shifting modes here: As secretary, what role do you see yourself playing in the reauthorization process when it comes to MAP-21?	N
AnI am wondering what your thoughts are with respect to that particular process anwhat role you see yourself playing in it.	N
With regarto this issue, there always seem to be more projects than there is funding, anI am curious, as mayor, how you have gone about setting priorities when it comes to determining which projects get fundeanwhich don't.	N
The American people, a lot of people depenupon you, look to you, anneeto be able to builtrust.	N
Give me just a little bit of your thoughts about how you woulbuilthat kinof trust ancredibility, not only with the people that woulbe under you but also with the American people who will be looking to you for leadership.	N
For my colleagues, it now says there are no votes before 4:35, so we can relax a little bit.	N
Anmy thanks to you anto your family for your willingness to serve anyour service in the past.	N
As you know, my state has just been through a major transportation crisis, an incident that certainly speaks to the neefor investment, not only in rail but in all forms of transportation, but most especially rail, because I think that this incident, an accident that coulhave cost even more lives, causemore injuries, andone even greater damage, fortunately was less severe than it might have been.	N
Anthat fact is due to the investment that was made in the most advanced, at least to date, the more advancetype of railroacars, the M8 railcars, on the Metro-North line, which most likely preventemore injuries anlimitethe severity of the ones that occurred.	N
The lack of investment in our rail lines, in our tracks another equipment, has left them without important quality ansafety upgrades.	N
So I woullike a commitment from you that you will prioritize investments in infrastructure ansafety measures for all of our railroalines but most especially in the Northeast Corridor.	N
AnI think what that collision or accident shows is that our rail lines are deteriorateanoutdateandecrepit in many sections of that Northeast Corridor.	N
I hope that you will take your message as a very articulate anpowerful spokesperson on the road.	N
AnI want to make you an offer that maybe you can refuse but I hope not: that you make one of your first trips to visit us in Connecticut, specifically in Bridgeport, ancome with me to the site of that collision.	N
You have made the offer, anI am grateful for it, that you will work with me, but I woulask you to work with our entire delegation in developing a consensus arounthe Northeast Corridor rail financing plan.	N
Anthat really relates not only to Connecticut but really to the collection of states that depenon this vital artery--it is an artery--that right now is back in operation but for a time, because of that Bridgeport accident, was essentially chokeanstranglein the ability to move people anfreight another essentials along that Northeast Corridor.	N
AnI am hoping that you will work with our delegation anwith representatives ansenators from throughout our region.	N
Let me also ask about perhaps some of the advances in technology anscience that have to do with rail transport that perhaps we can help to implement.	N
The National Transportation Safety Board, I will say very commendably, was on the scene literally within hours.	N
AnI met with Earl Weener, the boarmember who was assigneto this responsibility, along with a very able team, that very next morning.	N
So we don't want to prejudge what the results will show, but I hope--here is my main point about the investigation--that it will be done more quickly than perhaps the projections are right now.	N
I hope that you will do whatever you can--I know it is an independent board--to assure that we know what the results are.	N
Anin the less than a minute that I have left, I woullike to ask for your continuing support for our air controllers anair control towers, the contract control towers, which we anthe Congress have saiare vital to air safety, economic development, anjobs in those areas serveby the airport.	N
Anafter you visit Connecticut, I hope you also come to Minnesota ansee our 10,000 lakes anour beautiful new Twins stadium.	N
AnI think you woulalso see the Central Corridor, our light rail system, near up anrunning, as well as a number of highways that neea lot of work.	N
I was just visiting just this past week with people near Rogers, Minnesota, where Highway 94 is a bottleneck in a certain area; U.S. Highway 10 in Anoka, Minnesota, which is adjacent to nine towns anis considereone of the fastest-growing corridors in the U.S.	N
While Senator Boxer anSenator Inhofe dian amazing job getting that bill done, anSenator Rockefeller anthis committee haa lot to do with that as well, there is more to be done.	N
Anlast Congress, I introducethe RebuilAmerica Jobs Act, which woulhave provide$50 billion for direct infrastructure investments.	N
Some of the work that Senator Blumenthal talkeabout coulhave been paifor; some of the work that we saw needeto be done after that bridge collapsein the middle of the Mississippi River just six blocks from my house on a beautiful summer day.	N
Anas I saithat day, when that eight-lane highway headeinto that river, a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America, but it did.	N
This money is similar to what the president has put forth in his Fix It First proposal in his recent budget.	N
What do you suggest we do to get the kinof funding that we neeto really get goods to market anmake this country strong again for infrastructure?	N
AnI think some strides have been made, but, as you know, it is still a major problem when you look at the statistics.	N
Well, now that you have your new job, you are going to be dealing with things like snowmobiles, something you might not have in North Carolina.	N
AnI workeharwith several of my colleagues to ensure that the Recreational Trails Program was maintainein MAP-21.	N
RTP funds off-highway vehicle, snowmobile, annonmotorizetrail uses anderives its funding from gas taxes paiby off-highway vehicle users when they fill up their machines.	N
If confirmed, will you work to ensure that this valuable program continues to meet the needs of all trail users in Minnesota anacross the nation?	N
One of the few industries to enjoy an exemption from antitrust laws is the freight railroaindustry.	N
I know that Chairman Rockefeller has been working on the Surface Transportation Boarreforms to address this issue.	N
Are you aware of the shipper concerns about the high prices that many shippers are paying--we call them captive shippers--	N
Just remember the numbers 63 an4. We useto have 63 rail carriers; we now have only 4 major rail carriers, which happens to be the exact number on the Monopoly board.	N
One of the most promising initiatives involverewriting regulations for smaller airplanes.	N
It will enable better safety technologies to be fieldeto address issues like loss of control, which is the number one case of general aviation accidents.	N
I am introducing a bill with Senator Murkowski of Alaska to push this effort forwarat the Federal Aviation Administration.	N
AnI hope you will look into this bill, anwe woullove to have your support for this work.	N
We have some other questions I will put on the recoron air traffic controllers antowers, such an issue for so many of us, to make sure that they are maintained.	N
I think mayors have a sense of knowing on the front line what is going on, anwe neethat in a transportation secretary.	N
I was sitting here remembering the former mayor of Minneapolis, who is quite olnow, but he once tolme the story that he got a call on a Sunday from a constituent who saithat the trash was not pickeup in his neighborhood.	N
Anthe Mayor said, ``You know what, look, buddy, I will give you the number of our public works person; you can call him directly today on a Sunday.''	N
Anthe constituent pauseanhe said, ``I know who that guy is, but I don't want to bother him on a Sunday.''	N
Anso I think that you will be--as we talked, many of us believe Secretary LaHoodian amazing job in working with Members of Congress anlocal communities anmayors, understoothat frontline ability to accomplish even more if you understanwhat people neein their areas anunderstanSenator Blumenthal's concerns about Connecticut.	N
AnI hope that you will bring that forwarfrom your work as a mayor annever let that go.	N
For the first time in my memory, we are breaking the order-of-arrival sanctity, anSenator Cowan has, with utmost graciousness, yieldehis place to Senator Scott.	N
Senator Cowan, I thought it was perhaps because Mr. Rockefeller thought I was Senator Cowan.	N
In the spirit of getting the last woron this, I am glawe are both here together so we can put truth to the rumor that there is only one of us.	N
This probably is perhaps the most amazing confirmation process I have seen so far in my short term in the Senate.	N
I will tell you that so often I hear pointequestions with pointeresponses ana lot of deliberation about nothing.	N
Today I have hearvery kincomments anperhaps still a lot of deliberation so far about nothing.	N
I woulsay that, as your neighbor to the south, the tolling impact woulbe harmful from our perspective.	N
So we hope that you take a serious look at the entire corridor as it relates to the tolling process.	N
TIGER grants have been celebrateas a success, providing much-neederesources to the local level.	N
I will tell you that there seems to be, according to GAO anthe DOT inspector general, they have both raisesome concerns as to how the awards are made.	N
How do you plan to ensure that these grant projects will be selecteon a transparent, merit-basesystem?	N
I woultell you that a project-specific, merit-basesystem woulbe welcomeversus what sometimes appears to be a district-specific, redistricts versus blue districts, funding formula that seems to be en vogue at times.	N
My final question--anI will try to do something that seems to perhaps be celebrateby my colleague from the North, is to reserve angive back the balance of my time, which I want you to pay attention to that, as we have 7 minutes insteaof 5.	N
I woulhope that you woulfinit within your approach to being the secretary of transportation where you woulfinalternative solutions as opposeto having a user fee, which woulof course be cumbersome anchallenging in the aviation footprint.	N
Congratulations to you anyour family, your lovely wife, Samara, anyour beautiful children.	N
If confirmed, I am confident you will be--as I hope you will be, anI am sure you will be--you will serve this country well as the heaof DOT.	N
It is clear from our conversation not just the other day but conversations you anI have hain your capacity as Mayor of the Queen City of North Carolina anmine as Chief of Staff of the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts that you truly understanthe importance of transportation, not just the means from getting from here to there, but as a methoof opening up economic opportunity, creating jobs, anfostering healthier communities.	N
AnI hope that we continue to have a rich conversation today about projects that are critical to Massachusetts that you know are near andear to my heart.	N
I know Governor Patrick has spoken with you about this previously; you anI talkeabout it last week.	N
This is a project that I think is a great example of the transformative power of transportation, rail in particular, which woulopen up the entire south coast region of Massachusetts to opportunity untold.	N
We have been working for years to try to bring this to fruition, anI thank Secretary LaHoofor his efforts on that behalf.	N
That said, you know, we are still not where we neeto be, anwe have been working with the Army Corps of Engineers to try to move things along.	N
Anso my first question to you is, when you come up north to visit Senator Blumenthal anthe folks in Connecticut, I trust you will stop in Massachusetts, come see where we are on the South Coast Rail project.	N
AnI hope I can get your commitment that you will continue to look at this project for what it is, a great opportunity not just for Massachusetts but the whole northeast region anthe Nation to spur economic activity, anthat you will work with us anthe Army Corps of Engineers to move this project along, a project that is long delayed.	D
You come anytime; I woulbe happy to drive you down there myself ansee all the prosperity that is just waiting to unleash.	N
This is a project that former Governor Mitt Romney signeinto law as a condition of the so-	N
Anwe have hasome starts anfits with Transportation, who wanteto see more of an effort on the state side.	N
Anas I mentioneto you last week, that effort is in place anthe results are there, anwe are ready to move forward.	N
When you come to visit, you will sit with our state transportation officials anthe local officials in Somerville, Medford, anthe surrounding towns to talk about the economic opportunity that, again, is waiting for this rail line to bring forth.	N
Anthe last Massachusetts-specific project, because I am sure some of my colleagues are growing weary of me talking about Massachusetts projects, but the Worcester Airport.	N
Secretary LaHoohas been very cooperative ana great partner with us in opening up that modal for expandegrowth in the second-largest city in Massachusetts, which is in the center of the state.	N
AnI am pleaseto say that, while I was saddeneto see Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray today announce that he was stepping down, I am pleasethat he is going to run the Worcester Chamber of Commerce.	N
I am hoping that you will take the time to see how, again, that airport, that venue is going to open up the region anyou will continue the support that Secretary LaHoohas been providing in recent years.	N
Last but not least, Mr. Mayor, I woullove to hear you talk a little more--Senator Klobuchar talkeabout the infrastructure bank.	N
Anyou mentioned, I believe, in your response that you see value in the infrastructure bank.	N
Coulyou expounon that a little bit anperhaps any other thoughts you may have about how we take advantage of what little resources we have right now or what new resources are needeto really grow our infrastructure andeal with some of the state-of-repair issues that you anI know are holding us back, so that we can make sure our roads anbridges are safe anproductive for our economic needs?	N
Senator Fischer--welcome you to the Committee anappreciate you taking the time to be here to answer our questions.	N
As we discussein our meeting, I previously serveas Chair of the Transportation anTelecommunications Committee in the Nebraska legislature, anso I have a huge interest in infrastructure issues.	N
I believe infrastructure is a core responsibility, a core priority for government, anat the Federal level I believe it is only seconto our national security.	N
Whether it is roads, bridges, ports, airports, infrastructure is the backbone of our economy anhelps to maintain strong communities all across this country.	N
It plays an important role in the funding anthe managing of our national infrastructure system.	N
However, this must be in a responsible manner that is worthy of those hard-earnetaxpayer dollars.	N
We neeto figure out how we are going to stretch the revenue that we have available so that we can meet the needs all across this country.	N
As we talkeabout looking for those efficiencies when you were in my office, I askeyou if you haany examples.	N
I am wondering at this time if you have hathe opportunity to visit with some people in the department in order to maybe tell me some examples where you might look for efficiencies within that huge department.	N
Nebraska is a state of distances, anwe understanthe importance of our highway system in order to promote commerce, in order to promote the safety of citizens all across our state, in order to connect us all.	N
Anwe are concerned, as other states are across this country, about lack of sufficient revenue to not just maintain our roads anmaintain our bridges so that they are in safe condition ancan handle addecapacity as needebut we neeto build.	N
You know, we can talk about an infrastructure bank, but that is not going to work either unless we have a dedicatesource of revenue going into it.	N
Anthank you for your openness anwillingness to work together on these very, very important issues that are before us.	N
Anthank you, Mayor Foxx, for being here anstepping up anbeing willing to take this responsibility.	N
I don't want to repeat a lot of things that you have already been askeanprobably answerefor the few minutes I was gone.	N
You know, I think a thirof the air traffic controllers right now are eligible to retire, ana significant number of them are about to get to the mandatory retirement time.	N
So there has just been this training proposal of a training facility that has been out there analmost got awardea few years ago.	N
Anmy view woulbe that I hope we can continue to pursue how we get that training into a system that works better than the moving-arountraining that is going now.	N
And, you know, the other thing that I think we all neeto collectively work on is figuring out a strategy of how to prioritize furloughs another things.	N
Anyou are starting at a time when it is pretty obvious what happens when we are not all open with each other about that.	N
And, you know, we hathe FAA administrator in just 48 hours before they announcea lot of air traffic controller furloughs, anI think he was asked, I guess not quite directly enough, but pretty directly in a way that shoulhave gotten more information than we got.	N
You know, a lot of the things I think we want to sento your--almost unfair to--they are technical enough in nature.	N
I just think we neeto be sure that, when it comes time to do it, we are really ready to do it.	N
AnI think we are going to have to look at that anbe sure that is implementein the right way.	N
Anthen have you haa chance to talk yet today about your views generally on the next highway bill?	N
I mean, that is one of the things we were able to get done in the last 2 years, but we only got it done for 2 years, so that is coming up pretty quickly.	N
I believe the normal request for reauthorization that woulhave come from the Secretary of Transportation dinot come because Mr. LaHoois leaving.	N
Anso it is something he didn't have to do but something I woulthink you woulquickly want to get into that discussion and----	N
Well, as we change vehicles, the kinds of vehicles, the mix of vehicles on the road, anas we try to make vehicles more efficient, get more miles out of the gallon of the vehicles that are paying the per-gallon tax, obviously you are working away from your funding stream every time you put more vehicles on the roalonger that use less fuel, which obviously we woulwant to do that, but it doesn't make the formula work like it did.	N
But my response is: Because everybody we work for is totally dependent on everything he is going to be responsible for.	N
I am very excitethat U.S. DOT is working right now on the first national multimodal freight strategic plan.	N
You anI haa chance to talk about this, but I want to hear your thoughts or public commitment to whether you will continue the work that Secretary LaHoostartein implementing a national freight policy.	N
One of the issues relateto that is obviously the level of congestion that affects our ports or affects our roadways in moving U.S. products to their destination.	N
So do you believe that there is a neeto establish a dedicatesource of funding for nationally anregionally significant freight mobility projects?	N
A very Washington-state-centric issue: Our ferry systems carry annually more than double the amount of people compareto the Amtrak Northeast Corridor.	N
Our ferries are like many of the national transportation systems; they face congestion or problems.	N
Anso I want to make sure that I have your assurances that the ferry system anits funding from the Department of Transportation will receive the support that they deserve as part of our National Highway System.	N
One of the priorities that Chairman Rockefeller, under his leadership, passewas the Aviation Safety Act of 2010, anthis was to address the aftermath of the 2009 Colgan Air crash, something that includeseveral rulemakings which have been completed, but there are some that still haven't been.	N
Administrator Huerta tolthe Committee multiple times that new rules for pilot qualifications for these regional aircrafts will be completebefore August 1, 2013.	N
This is something that is very important to many of us on this committee, anwanteto get your support in confirming that the Committee can count on you to ensure that these rules do get implementeor, I shoulsay, publisheby the August 1 deadline.	N
Anone last issue if I coulget your thoughts on is the transparency in airline ticket pricing.	N
Last year, airlines collecteabout $6 billion in baggage anreservation-change fees from passengers, but because of the growing menu of ancillary fees, it has been increasingly difficult for consumers to compare anshop for airfares.	N
AnI know that there has been a lot going on both with the department anchallenges by the airlines to some of these rules, you know, almost all the way to the Supreme Court.	N
So I know that there are some proposeairline ticket transparency rules now under review by OMB, but I wanteto get your thoughts on the importance of giving consumers better information so that they can make the right pricing decisions.	N
AnI want to start by revisiting the conversation you just haa moment ago with Senator Blunt concerning the FAA air traffic controller furloughs ansequestration.	N
And, indeed, given the fiscal aneconomic challenges we have, we may see even further budgetary cuts at some point in the future.	N
Anquite a few of us have been concernethat the administration, in implementing sequestration, has been looking for ways to implement those cuts that are visible anpainful anexacerbate the pain of the cuts.	N
And, indeed, quite a few of us, I think, believethat the air traffic controller furloughs was an example of that.	N
Can we have a commitment from you that, in implementing sequestration anin implementing whatever further budget cuts may occur down the road, that you will employ your very best efforts to target waste, fraud, anabuse, to target redundancy, to target ways to trim the fat antighten the belt, while minimizing the pain aninconvenience to customers, to the American people, while minimizing unnecessary inconvenience to consumers?	N
Anso it is fair to say that you woullook for ways to minimize the pain annot to exacerbate it.	N
I woullike to shift to another topic that you anI, I think, haa very productive conversation on, anthat concerneregulation anthe impact of government regulation retarding economic growth, killing jobs, anthe neefor regulatory reform, which is a principle that the president has publicly espoused.	N
I woulnote that just recently the Congressional Research Service releasea report that indicates that during the first 4 years of President Obama's administration that the administration issuemore than 13,000 final rules, which was substantially more than its predecessor.	N
And, indeed, there were 330 major rules, rules that have economic impact of $100 million or greater.	N
Anthat representea 24 percent increase from the seconterm of the Bush administration.	N
Angiven the concerns you raiseabout working to minimize the harm of regulations, woulyou agree in your first 100 days as secretary, if you are confirmed, to work to identify at least three regulations within your purview that, in your judgment, are unduly burdensome anto work with me to ameliorate that burden?	N
Anif I may ask the Chairman's indulgence to ask one additional question, although my time has expired.	N
Anthe final question I wanteto ask is, there is a provision in MAP-21 that allows states to assume responsibilities for environmental studies anclearances.	N
Anone of the significant impediments to building new transportation projects can be those clearances.	N
California has already been able to realize a 25 percent cost antime savings as a result of the NEPA delegation.	N
AnTexas will now have to petition the Department to be granteauthority for NEPA delegation.	N
Anif you are confirmed, I wanteto ask your approach to how you will approach that petition that will be forthcoming.	N
Mr. Chairman, if I couljust ato what you have said--anI do have another question or two, but I can put those on the record, because I know you are going to be responding to some questions on the record.	N
But I think one observation I woulmake with regarto where we are, the one thing we can't do--anthis is why I askethe question about the next highway bill anwhat you saw your role as being--we cannot continue to borrow from the general funto funhighways.	N
We either have to decide that we are going to pay for it anfigure out how we are going to do it or we are going to have to have a lot smaller appetite when it comes to infrastructure.	N
The one outcome that is not acceptable to me is to continue to borrow anto transfer from the general funanbasically put that on the backs of our children angrandchildren.	N
My frustration is that, when the DOT secretaries come in front of the Committee anwe have askefor specific suggestions about how to do that, you know, we usually get the answer, ``We will work with you, with Congress,'' anwe understanthat.	N
But I also hope that you will lead, that the President will lead, ancome up anput specific ideas on the table about how to solve these problems.	N
It is important to our country, it is important to our competitiveness, it is important to our economy.	N
Anso everything that we do, we ought to have a focus on, what will this do to grow the economy, to create jobs, anto improve the take-home pay of middle-class Americans?	N
AnI think a robust, strong infrastructure that supports that economy is critical anvital to that, but it has to be paifor.	N
Anso I hope that you will get your pencils out anfinas many savings as you can within the department's budget anlook at doing things more efficiently, but then when it comes to putting proposals forward, with regard, for example, to the next highway bill, to be specific and, you know, come at us with your ideas.	N
I want to get you on the recoron this, because I mentionein our meeting that Senator McCaskill anI were successful last year in enacting the European Trading Scheme Prohibition Act.	N
AnI just want to know if you are prepareto exercise your authority grantein the law to protect U.S. aviation users from the ill effects of the EU ETS if that is necessary.	N
Ando you believe that ICAO is the place, which operates through international consensus, is the proper venue anmanner to address international aviation emissions reductions?	N
We may be facing that issue here again in the not-too-distant future, so I look forwarto working with you on that.	N
We are going to consider the nomination of Dr. Mark E. Schaefer of California to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans anAtmosphere at the U.S. Department of Commerce.	N
We look forwarto your testimony, Doctor, anI want to accommodate the Senator from the great state of Hawaii, who needs to excuse himself because he has got to fly to Hawaii.	N
Dr. Schaefer, thank you for taking the time to testify before this committee anfor visiting with my office individually.	N
I am impresseby your qualifications anyour track recorof resolving issues with open ancandidialogue.	D
The budgetary process anpressures from the sequester will make your problem-solving through dialogue approach all the more important.	N
But when funding is short, we cannot afforthe expenses aninefficiency of lawsuits to manage critical ocean ancoastal resources.	N
AnI do look forwarto working with the issues that I will mention to you on the record, as well as anything that may come up in Hawaii anthe Pacific.	N
First, the statutory time limit of December 7, 2013 for NOAA's listing decision on 66 species of Pacific corals is rapidly approaching.	N
Academic experts at the University of Hawaii have questioneNOAA's scientific basis for such a listing, but to the best of my knowledge, NOAA has not yet workewith the university experts to address their concerns.	N
Coulyou please describe your approach going forwaranhow you are going to use the University of Hawaii's expertise on this important matter?	N
My question is about the bigeye tuna issue, if you will just give me a moment to pull up the question.	N
The Western Pacific Fisheries Management Commission has, under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, establishean annual quota on bigeye tuna for Hawaii's longline fleet.	N
If confirmed, do I have your commitment to work with us to constructively support the well-manageWestern Pacific longline fishery?	N
Anto the extent that it is both profitable ansustainable, it ought to be a model for the rest of the world.	N
Anwe are going to have to make some adjustments on the fly to make sure that they remain economically viable as they have demonstratethat they are being managesustainably.	N
I just left the Joint Economic Committee talking about infrastructure, anI got over here as soon as I could.	N
So I am appreciative that Senator Schatz was here to ask questions, anI am glathat we dinot adjourn the hearing before I coulget here.	N
I want to thank you, Senator Nelson, for chairing this hearing on the nomination of Dr. Schaefer to be Assistant Secretary for--of Commerce for Oceans anAtmosphere.	N
It is important for the Committee to review the nominations for NOAA leadership promptly in order for this Agency to be manageappropriately.	N
It may come to--as a surprise to some of our viewers today that NOAA is the largest agency within the Department of Commerce, anhas a mission of science, service, anstewardship.	N
The Agency is responsible for conducting research angathering data to help us understanour oceans anatmosphere, as well as manage our resources.	N
The responsibilities of NOAA include daily weather forecasts, fisheries management, coastal restoration, ansupport for marine commerce.	N
NOAA is organizeinto six line offices anrequires strong leadership to ensure that these line offices of working together anserving the needs of our country.	N
NOAA has a vital presence throughout our Nation, including in my home state of Mississippi.	N
NOAA facilities in Mississippi include the National Data Buoy Center, the Northern Gulf Institute, the National Institute for Undersea Science anTechnology, anthe National Coastal Data Development Center.	N
The work performeat these centers aninstitutes is important for understanding our oceans ancoasts anprotecting our resources for our citizens.	N
Today, NOAA faces many challenges, including a tough fiscal environment, needeimprovements in fisheries management, anthe restoration of the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon disaster.	N
Large cuts have already been made at the National Data Buoy Center, which is crucial for environmental monitoring.	N
This year, two lawsuits were fileagainst the National Marine Fisheries Services regarding the Federal management of resnapper, anI will ask the witness about that in just a moment.	N
It is also taskewith important responsibilities for Gulf restoration under the RESTORE Act.	N
I look forwarto hearing Dr. Schaefer's perspectives on how NOAA can face these challenges.	D
Tell us what--enlighten the Committee, if you will, about the resnapper lawsuits, anhow do you feel about fisheries management approaches that require coordination between the states anFederal Government?	N
Do you think the discrepancy in the estimates is a result of different methodologies useby various scientists?	N
How do you plan to work with other agencies anacademic institutions to deal with complex problems, such as the deazone?	N
Senator, my heart goes out to you, anto Senator Landrieu, anSenator Vitter, for the deazone is the size of Delaware, off your states.	N
Now, we have enough trouble in Florida with deazones of pollutewater being dumpeout of Lake Okeechobee, which it has to because the lake gets too high, anit threatens the earthen dam because of the pressure.	N
But what it does is it creates a deazone to the east in the St. Lucia River anto the west in the Caloosahatchee River.	N
Anthe same thing is happening now because the water has gotten up to 15 feet high, anthe Corps of Engineers is going to have to start dumping water out of there to avert a disaster of it breaking the dam anflooding all of these agricultural anpopulateareas.	N
AnI just cannot imagine a deazone the size of the state of Delaware off your anLouisiana state.	N
Anit is being done through an Everglades Restoration Project, which we have it going on pretty good.	N
Anwe will certainly look to you anothers for assistance in this regard, as well as looking to NOAA for the facts anthe science.	N
Now, with regarto your questions on the fisheries, thanks to your help, you were a co-sponsor of the RESTORE Act.	N
Once the judge makes his decision on what the fine is going to be, that money is going to flow pursuant to the law that we pass callethe RESTORE Act.	N
Antwo ana half percent of that total is going to go to try to address exactly the question that you answered--that you asked, which was, what is the fish population out there?	N
Anmaking those assessments through the National Marine Fisheries Service, helpeby the commission that was set up by the RESTORE Act, in order to have up to date data on what the fish population is so that we do not go through what we have been going through, where decisions are made to cut off a fishery with outdatedata, data that is six anseven years old.	N
So, Dr. Schaefer, tell us what you think about it since you are going to be working directly with the National Marine Fisheries Service about utilizing that two ana half percent of the RESTORE Act.	N
Now, Senator Rubio anI are going to have a hearing in a couple of weeks down in famous Apalachicola Bay, which useto be known anhas been known over the centuries as some of the finest oysters.	N
It is being threateneby a number of things, not the least of which the lack of fresh water coming down the river that starts the Chattahoochee River up north of Atlanta.	N
Anthis fishery collapselast year, long-term drought plus the lack of the fresh water coming down the river, illegal harvesting.	N
Now, it is my understanding that NOAA needs information to document a fishery failure before it can declare an emergency.	N
So do you have information on this that you can update us on the status of this declaration?	N
Well, we are going to help you along by virtue of the hearing that we will have coming up in the early part of August down there.	N
AnI think as I walkein, I hearthe chairman talking about how do we determine how much fish or other types of aquatic life we have in an area.	N
Anthis is an issue that I am very concerneabout in the Gulf of Maine, that we have haa situation, particularly with the coanhaa stock in the Gulf of Maine, that as a result of actions taken by NOAA--in fact, yesterday I was questioning Administrator Bullarabout this issue, that our fishermen have gone through this year a 78 percent cut in what they can fish for in their quota for the Gulf of Maine--in the Gulf of Maine for cod.	N
Anone of the issues that was toucheupon in the hearing yesterday is that the neefor--in fact, the heaof the New EnglanFishery Management Council reiteratethis.	N
The neefor better data anresearch to be able to know exactly, you know, what stocks exist, anto put us in a position where, you know, these people who are small fishermen anwomen who have been put out of business, many of them have done this for generations.	N
Anso it is an issue that I am very concerneabout because there is a lot of feeling that the science behinit is that we have not adequately developeit to really understanwhere things are.	N
Anso, I wanteto get your thoughts on that because it seems to me that we neeto do better research so that we can strike the right balance so that, you know, people who have made their livelihood, I think, responsibly off the seas for years, trying to do the right thing, can continue to do that, while we make sure that we have obviously adequate stocks.	N
Anyone who is running any kinof business, if they saw a 78 percent reduction--I mean, it is harto see how they woulsurvive, anparticularly those who have made their way on the seas for years angenerations.	N
That is very important to all of us in New England, anthat you woulgive a commitment to that issue to make sure that what we are doing in research is adequate, anif we neeto obviously put a greater emphasis on it, if you communicate that with the Committee, I certainly look forwarto working with you on that.	N
I recently on Monday haa meeting with a lot of my guys in the fisheries business, anmy question really is very similar to Senator Ayotte's question.	N
I woullove for you to come down to South Carolina antake a look off the coast so you can have an appreciation for the reality that we, at least at home, believe that we neemore sounscience to show the reality of the oceans.	N
Anwe woullove for you to come down anparticipate in an offshore discovery opportunity.	N
I will say that one of the questions I thought was important that my fishermen were asking hato do with the fact that their livelihoois not a today-only livelihood.	N
There are actually multiple generations in the business, anthey have starterestaurants ansucceeded.	N
One specific company, Crosby Seafood, spent a lot of time just helping me understanwhat it takes for them to help create the wonderful tourism that we have on the coast.	N
We bring about $30 million tourism in from Myrtle Beach through Charleston anHilton Head.	N
Charleston has been fortunate to be the number one tourist destination in the world, according to Conde Nast magazine.	N
There is a company--a restaurant, Husk, number one new restaurant in 2011 in all of America.	N
They set their menus at midnight, anI am not sure if I have this exactly as they saiit, but this is basically how it happens.	N
They get a text from the satellite that tells them what is going to be available, anthen they set their menu for the next day because every day they try to change their menu.	N
Anthere are certain things that you cannot get during season, so in March anApril, it is very difficult to get any resnapper because of the limits.	N
So my question is, as we have driven our economy in South Carolina, especially on the coast of South Carolina, with tourism because of our restaurant business, which is then driven by what is founin the oceans, it woulbe very important for us to have an opportunity for you to come down anhelp us understanthe process that you woultake to uncover what NOAA really needs to do in order to understanwhat is happening off of the coast of South Carolina.	N
On James Island, I have been there a couple of times, anit really is a great resource for us.	N
The seconquestion I have for you, anit is really more of a comment than it is a question.	N
The President's Executive Order implementing a new national ocean policy gives NOAA responsibility for over 130 items without any specificity with respect to new regulations, or new regulatory actions, or legal authority that has been spelleout.	N
Anso, my real question is, one of the concerns that we have is that with that large footprint, without any clarity that woulbe provideby legislation, we finourselves in a position where it seems like the Federal reach woulgo beyonwhere it has been.	N
I woullove to have your comment on how to go about building a policy that creates clarity, anensuring that the bureaucracy does not start creating legislation essentially by rulemakings.	N
We hope to have the opportunity, if you are confirmed, to work with you on what we wouldefine as a Federal overreach, andefine some limits on how to gather the information in such a way that it makes it all work together ancreates connectivity without the Federal Government becoming in charge of what we believe is important to remain in the hands of states anlocal jurisdictions.	N
I want to reminthe colleagues that--anNOAA that we have agreeon an expediteprocess for questions for the record.	N
So for the Committee members, please have your questions submitteby the close of business tomorrow, July 25.	N
And, Dr. Schaefer, the Committee asks that your response to these questions be submitteby 10:00 Monday morning.	N
We hope to vote on your nomination at the Committee's Executive Session on Tuesday, July 30.	N
Anso, if we can expedite this process, it will enable us to go aheaanvote on your nomination.	N
Chairman Rockefeller anSenator Thune, thank you, as well as other members of the Committee, for allowing Senator Kirk anI to come here today to introduce the nominee that the President has offereto this committee anto Congress for the important position of Secretary of Commerce.	N
I know that you are leaning in our direction, Mr. Chairman, because of your wonderful Illinois-born wife anyour connections to our great State.	N
Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to introduce Penny Pritzker, the President's nominee to be Secretary of Commerce.	N
She is here with her family, whom she will introduce, I am sure, when the time is right for that.	N
What you see when you consider Ms. Pritzker is not only decades of business, entrepreneurial, ancivic experience, which make her a strong candidate for this position, but also a warm, compassionate person who has really given back to the committee in Illinois anacross the Nation.	D
Ms. Pritzker has built five businesses from scratch, serveon numerous corporate boards, anhas been an effective leader of major corporations.	D
She ranks as one of the most influential women in corporate America, anthat is quite an achievement when you consider the glass ceilings another obstacles which women face.	D
Her lifetime of business experience includes her current role as Founder, Chairman, anCEO of PSP Capital Partners anPritzker Realty Group.	D
She also serves on the Boarof Artemus Real Estate Partners anHyatt Hotels Corporation, previously serveon the boards of William Rigley, Jr. Company, Marmon Group, anthe LaSalle Bank Corporation.	D
Her decades of business experience will serve her well in leading this Agency's primary mission, which is to work with businesses, universities, ancommunities to promote job creation aneconomic growth.	D
Let me just point out a few things that Senator Durbin mentioned, that she startea new business from the grounup calleClassic Residence by Hyatt that already employs 3,500 Americans.	D
I have a letter for you that I woullike to submit for the recorby President Reagan's former Chairman of the FDIC, William Isaac, that I think will help you.	N
Senator Kirk.--I will be whipping each one of you on behalf of Penny's nomination coming up when the vote comes, hoping that this voice for business becomes our next Commerce Secretary.	N
Anthen what we are going to do is what we diyesterday, anthat is that other colleagues on both sides will not give opening remarks, but all questioning periods will go for 7 minutes so you can kinof do quite a lot with that, all right?	N
We are meeting today to consider a distinguishenominee to be the next Secretary of Commerce.	N
We have not haa Secretary of Commerce in a while, anif I can be just a bit rash, we have not haa strong Secretary of Commerce in quite a while.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you for holding this hearing today on the nomination of Penny Pritzker to be the next Secretary of Commerce.	D
Ms. Pritzker, the justifiable public outrage over the actions taken by the IRS against conservative organizations underscores how critical it is for government leaders to scrupulously honor the public trust.	D
My question is, what, if anything, can you pledge this committee regarding your commitment to safeguarthe trust that woulbe bestoweupon you as a Cabinet Secretary?	N
We have all watchethis week with what happenein Moore, Oklahoma, anour hearts anprayers go out to the people who were struck by that deadly andevastating tornado this week.	N
At the same time, we can be grateful that the warnings analerts issueby the Commerce Department's National Weather Service helpeto save lives.	N
As you learn firsthand, if confirmed--you will learn, I shoulsay--every department anagency is making tough choices in the face of necessary budget cuts.	N
Can we have your commitment that if confirmed, you will ensure that budget cuts are made in ways that prioritize funding for the Department's public safety missions, like the delivery of timely warnings about severe weather?	N
Ancan you pledge to us as well that you will work with this committee to finefficiencies anways to stretch taxpayer dollars further when it comes to the various responsibilities of the Commerce Department?	N
As I mentioneearlier in my opening remarks, some have criticizethe Administration as being anti-	N
In 2010, the Chairman of the Business Roundtable anCOO of Verizon famously saithe Administration was fostering this, anthis is, I quote, ``an increasingly hostile environment for investment anjob creation.''	N
If confirmed, you woulbring a track recorof entrepreneurial activity in the private sector as well as service on the President's Jobs Council to the position of Secretary.	D
Anmaybe as a follow up to that, can you provide some examples of actions that you have taken or strategies that you have usesuccessfully to create jobs in the private sector?	N
But with regarto the failure of Superior Bank in 2001, it was a bank that was one of the early leaders in subprime lending.	N
Some of your defenders have statethat you hano active role in management of the bank for 7 years prior to the bank's failure.	N
But according to a report issueby the FDIC's inspector general, concerns were raiseby the Office of Thrift Supervision about the bank's mortgage banking practices as early as 1993 when you were still Chair of the bank's board.	D
In addition, others have pointeout that you continueto serve as a boarmember for Superior Bank's holding company ansat on the bank's audit company--or audit committee until its failure.	D
Coulyou just tell us what role you playeat the bank in the years leading up to Superior Bank's failure in 2001?	N
So ultimately there were a number of the bank's uninsuredepositors that haclaims that they lost over $100,000 worth of savings, including one who reportedly depositeher entire retirement account with Superior a month before it failed.	N
What do you have to say to those depositors who lost significant sums of money because of this venture, anwhat lessons diyou learn from your experience at Superior Bank that will inform your role as Secretary of Commerce, if you are confirmed?	D
My hope is that this committee will recommenyou anthat you will be able to serve, I think, as someone who--a deep backgrounin business.	D
This is a voice that will be needein the Administration anwill help us again--help this economy recover, anfocus again on greater job creation.	N
at the Department, but down a bit, is the National Telecommunications anInformation Administration, NTIA, anpart of that was spectrum management.	N
The President has laiout a very ambitious goal to try to get 500 megahertz spectrum available over the next 10 years.	N
I woullike for you to speak a little bit about how we can make sure that we keep that on track.	N
Anone of our challenges is to make sure that our Federal entities are a little more responsive in terms of spectrum sharing antrying to make sure that we take full opportunity anget full economy-wide value of this public asset.	N
Well, I might just add, I know there is some spectrum in that 1755 to 1780 megahertz range, that 25 megahertz of spectrum that we coulmove quicker on.	N
We are just starting to get into the weeds already, but there have been some that say let us take a bigger block.	N
Another area that you are going to have at least oversight over is the Patent anTrade Office.	N
I think we are all concernethat entrepreneurs are victims more anmore often of patent trolls.	N
I think we have seen unfortunately in my olindustries massive allocations of capital to basically builpatent arsenals that coulbe better utilizein terms of innovative anbreakthrough technology rather than simply building up arsenals to--in what coulbe, frankly, litigation wars.	N
I do not know if you might want to have some general comments about what we can do to try to make sure that we get better ideas into the marketplace antry to decrease the--what I think is the dramatic increase of patent litigation, much of it not geareat real innovation protection, but really just about trying to sometimes transfer wealth between large entities.	N
I personally believe that we ought to give the President's--this President anfuture presidents the ability that any Governor has hato do executive reorganization.	N
I will not open that can of worms at this hearing today, but my hope woulbe is that you will come in with a fresh look--an entrepreneur's anbusiness person's look--at the wide variety of programs within the Commerce Department, look at where there can be streamlining, look where there can be consolidation, look where we can better bang for the buck.	N
AnI might just, you know, again, editorialize anhighlight one area that we have workeon anwe haan opportunity to have a brief conversation about.	N
I have been trying to get this Administration for years to actually look at how we might support State anlocal economic development efforts at a Federal level to bring jobs back into America for a whole host of reasons, jobs that habeen outsourceover the past few years.	N
Companies are looking at bringing manufacturing another production jobs back to this country particularly in rural areas.	N
My hope is you will, one, as my time ticks down, look at streamlining all programmatic areas within the Commerce Department, and, two, work with me another members--this is some bipartisan legislation I have actually got with Congressman Frank Wolf in the House, at how we can do a better job at the Federal level to support insourcing of jobs back into this country.	N
I shoulwarn my colleagues that the floor is not behaving properly, anthey are talking about a 12 vote.	N
But what I woulsuggest is on my side of the dais here, that we cut our 7 minutes down to 5 minutes, anthe other side of the aisle will have 7 minutes.	N
Anwhen we hathe pleasure of meeting anhaving a gooconversation, I also brought up about looking at streamlining the Department, looking for efficiencies, anaskeif you haany examples at that time.	N
Have you thought of any specific examples or maybe in different program areas where you woullook to finsome efficiencies?	N
Also we have a manufacturing sector here in this country that has facechallenges for many, many years.	N
If we are going to ensure that our manufacturing sector is competitive, I think we have to look at regulations.	N
Woulyou commit to looking at those regulatory policies, anI believe especially the trade policies that we have in this country, so that we can ensure that we have a more level playing field?	N
I happen to believe that trade is vital for not just manufacturing, for ag products as well.	N
AnI see that as a definite area for growth anjob creation, so I appreciate your focus on that.	N
Senator Warner was asking you about spectrum, anas you know from our discussion, that is an important issue, I believe, for the country, that we have to look at aspectrum.	N
There has been some discussion on how accurate the cost estimates have been with regards to spectrum.	N
I believe the Department of Defense in the past has estimatethat it woulcost $4.6 billion to clear that 1755 to the 1850 band.	N
You are, Senator Fischer, especially to Senator Blunt, because if he leaves, this is going to be a disaster.	N
We are always prepareto work in a bipartisan fashion in reducing the time, at least in questioning Ms. Pritzker.	N
I enjoyeour conversation just in the last couple of days, anwe hit on a couple of topics that I thought were very important to the future of America, one being trade.	N
Anwe haa robust conversation about China, which I think is important to consider, from currency issues to enforcing parts of our free trade agreements that have already been passed.	N
I believe that South Carolina's manufacturing base is a part of the solution for our future.	N
If we as Americans do not continue to make things that are tangible, we have a very long roaaheaof us.	N
So Mr. Warner anI will be working on the Subcommittee of Competiveness, Innovation, anExport Promotion.	N
I hope that we will have many opportunities to work with you as well if you are confirmed.	N
Anthen we have the seconhighest tire concentration with companies like Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental coming to our state as well anexpanding.	N
Anas we consider the topic of insourcing, having jobs come back to America, we can look no further than UTC anOtis Elevators, that now have a presence in Florence, South Carolina, with 400 jobs that have been insourceback.	N
My question to you is, I woullike to hear from you your thoughts on how we can further promote U.S. industry anencourage more foreign investment to come to places throughout the country, anof course, specifically, South Carolina.	D
The seconquestion really helps us bridge the gap ancreate more opportunities as it relates to our ability to track more investment to our country.	N
We certainly see that the enforcement of our trade laws is one of the common challenges that we face from things like transshipment of U.S. goods to Iran, to protection of our pharmaceutical companies' intellectual property, to proper classification of importegoods.	N
As Secretary of Commerce, if you are confirmed, how woulyou prioritize the enforcement of our trade laws?	N
One of the things that we have done well in South Carolina is the notion of synergy of our economic assets, realizing that having one of America's greatest ports in Charleston gives us an opportunity to attract that industry, like the BMWs anthe Boeings.	N
The infrastructure needs plus the transportation needs, whether it is transit or the Port of Charleston or other ports.	N
With the Panamax ships coming through the Panama Canal starting in 2015, 2016, will provide a real opportunity, a robust opportunity, for us to move forwaron meeting our expectations of doubling our exports over the next few years.	N
I woulnot have thought I hagotten this done before I hato leave, but I am glato get a chance to, one, welcome you to the Committee, and, two, welcome what you potentially bring to the Commerce Department.	N
I actually think the Acting Secretary has done an admirable job under difficult circumstances, anI think that this important Department needs somebody who is confirmed, anin charge, anready to take hold.	N
On transshipment, which Senator Scott mentioned, you know, actually it is an issue I have been pretty involvein because we have haseveral companies that get the ruling they need, the Chinese or someone else.	N
Most of these cases I am thinking of is the Chinese were not in compliance with trade laws.	N
They get a sanction against them, anthen somehow these same products just keep--start coming from somewhere else in a different box.	N
The Commerce Department has, as a matter of statepolicy, saithat it will not address evasion of duties through transshipment.	N
So we have got a bipartisan bill that was introducein the last Congress, the Enforce Act.	N
I hope that you will look into this anfinout why that woulbe the statepolicy of the Commerce Department.	N
Maybe they just think they have got too many things to keep track of, but this is a problem that many members of the Senate want to work with you to help solve.	N
Coulyou talk a little bit about the energy potential in the country today anhow that may--might have an impact on manufacturing?	N
Anas we mentionethe other day when we were visiting, I think that there is no more logical advocate for goocost-baseenergy policies than the Secretary of Commerce.	N
AnI am glathat you are headein that direction anyou are thinking as well--trade tax, the rule of law.	N
Another thing I might mention as I try to not take advantage of my--is travel, something you know a lot about.	N
When I was still in the House, we creates something that is now calleBranUSA, anI think it has great potential, but clearly needs somebody in the Department paying attention to be sure that everything they do is justified.	N
Again, you probably know more about that than anybody in this room, anyour sense of how important travel is to the economy, anparticularly foreign travel, if you want to say anything about that.	N
They spenmore, anwhen they leave, they almost always like us a whole lot better than they diwhen they came.	N
Anagain, in this job, you understanall of the impact of this throughout the economy, anlook forwarto working with you on that, assuming you are confirmed.	N
AnSenator Blunt anI have worketogether extensively on tourism, anI appreciate your knowledge.	D
I thought you answerethat well, so I am not going to go over that again, but I appreciate that.	N
I think you know this is a huge opportunity for our country to gain jobs, tens of thousands of jobs for every point that we gain back of the international tourism market.	N
When you anI talked, I spoke about the ability of the Commerce Secretary, particularly someone with your background, to really being an advocate for business as a whole, not just the things under your Agency, but that I see this neethat we have right now for someone to look at, I hasuggesteto you, our top 15, 20 exporting industries, anfigure out while they all have some things in common, they also each have individual things that can help: tourism, the visa wait times, a medical device.	D
You literally can go through the list anfinunique things, anI wondereif you coulcomment on that, the bigger role the Commerce Secretary coulplay anthat you coulenvision yourself playing.	N
You mentioneexports, anI think that the--part of this is, of course, the Foreign Commercial Service, anI just hope you will be committeto continuing that.	N
We woullove to see it expandeevery time we get some new business for one of our small-anmedium-sizebusinesses that cannot afforto have their own trade expert on Morocco, but can do a lot of business there.	N
I think we have a goothing going, anit is really one of the best things we can invest in.	N
So I hope you will continue to expanthat to help those small anmedium-sizebusinesses.	D
Some of my colleagues askeyou about manufacturing, anI just haa hearing on the Joint Economic Committee on women in manufacturing, anwe hathree women in business as witnesses.	N
Anas the recent book Lean In has pointeout, there is a lot of room for women to grow in business.	N
Across manufacturing, women only hol17 percent of the boarseats, are only 12 percent of the executive officers, anare just 6 percent of CEOs.	N
Anthen you go on the front line workers, the share of women workers in the manufacturing industry has been declining actually, even though we are seeing an upsurge in hiring right now since 1990 anis now 27 percent at its lowest level since 1971.	N
One is, as you know, we have job openings right now in manufacturing in states like mine that have a 5.4 percent unemployment rate.	N
Anthe manufacturers are trying to get women to go into this with the argument, this is no longer your grandpa's manufacturing floor anymore.	N
You are someone that has been successful in business, but how we get more women into the boardroom anrunning companies.	N
The Commerce Department anthe Economic Statistics Administration, as you know, provide critical up-to-date information about the social aneconomic needs of communities.	N
Anthat all sounds like a bunch of gobbledygook, but most people are not aware that business leaders heavily rely on this for demographic ansocioeconomic data so they can do business.	N
AnI just want to get your commitment because I know these kinof surveys can be under attack at times, but your understanding that they go to very goouse to help the American economy anpeople in business.	N
Anthank you for the commitment earlier with Senator Warner to continue the strong Patent Office.	N
We have one company, 3M, that literally has so many patents, they have a patent for every employee.	N
Anso it is very important for our State, anwe want to continue that in a strong way, as well as look at some of the patent troll issues with litigation.	N
Congratulations on your nomination, anthank you anyour family for your willingness to serve.	N
Obviously I anseveral in the Committee as a whole, I think, are confident that the breadth andepth of your experience in, both the private anthe public sector, will be a tremendous addebonus to the Commerce Department at this important time in our Nation's history.	D
You will be taking over the Department at a critical time for our economy, anI hope that as Secretary you will use all your experiences to create jobs anexpaneconomic opportunity in the Nation.	D
You know, from our conversation the other day anyour impressive resume, I know that you are well prepareto leathe Department, which is encouraging.	D
Anit is important to us in Massachusetts because we have some challenges right now, one of which you anI spent an extensive amount talking about.	N
Anit will surprise no one on this committee that I now wish to engage you on the issue of the fishing industry.	N
As you know, the fishing industry in Massachusetts is 300 years strong, anit is not just the boats anthe men anwomen who serve on those, but the seaside businesses that are important to us, but are also struggling because of changes in the fishing economy.	N
Right now, fishermen in the northeast are living under a 77 percent cut in the number of fish they can catch, anthe situation imperils the very existence of the industry.	N
Anas I mentioneto you, there are some challenges, some of which are manmade, anthat the fishing industry in my neck of the woods believe that they have not haa goopartner in the Commerce Department, anNOAA in particular, in recent years.	N
AnI talketo you about the neefor Commerce anNOAA to have a much more comprehensive anthoughtful aninclusive plan with our fishing industry to help save this industry anbridge a gap towarits--a brighter future.	N
Anso I want to ask at this time if you are willing to make a commitment to work with those of us who represent the great anproufishing industry in the northeast to plan for a brighter future anto address the realities that we are facing right now, anhelp us fina way forwarcollaboratively, because we believe that has been missing.	N
AnI, of course, woulinvite you to come up to Gloucester, New Bedford, any of our ports at any time to meet with our fishing community anthe municipal leaders who are so supportive of that industry.	N
If I couljust go back to a topic that has been raiseby the chairman ana few issues, the issue of cybersecurity.	N
As a business leader yourself, anyou mentionethe cyber hits that your current business has receivein the billions.	D
One of the issues as we grapple with this in Congress is what is the best way to move forwarconstructively, particularly arounthe issue of information sharing between the private anthe public sector?	N
AnI am wondering what is your viewpoint on that particular issue, both as a business owner anas someone who is going to be chargewith leading the Commerce Department?	N
AnI woulencourage you, again, during your visit to Massachusetts, you might want to visit with some of our elite higher einstitutions, including your alma mater anthe folks over at MIT anat Northeastern, where you are going to fina wealth of experts in the area of cybersecurity.	N
I am sure they woulbe willing to work with you anthe Department to help us fina way forward.	N
Anwith that, I am going to yielthe remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman, but thank Ms. Pritzker for her willingness to serve.	N
Senator Cowan, some of us are feeling a little hurt because you have declineto invite any of your colleagues to go up anlook at your fishing.	N
Chairman, I am penning handwritten notes even as I speak to each of you inviting you to the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts.	N
Having been in business myself, I can tell you there are many pluses that come to bringing private sector experience to the public sector realm, but also you have to face the challenges anbe accountable for some of the things that happenein the private sector, anpeople bring up all sorts of things.	N
So my first question is, you know, our state AFL-CIO anmany others have a boycott of the Alaska National Hyatt.	N
Anone of the issues is that they are concerneabout minimum wage jobs or the subcontracting of minimum wage jobs as a way to just keep the workforce at a lower rate.	N
So, one of the things you are going to face as Secretary is how to maintain anget high wage jobs into our economy.	N
So, do you want to comment on the former, or how we do the latter, anlook forwarto---- 	N
So this is a--the notion of subcontracting out to keep minimum wage jobs as a way to maintain a workforce is not something you support.	N
Well, one issue that I woullove to see you take a leadership role on within the Department, anone that you anI haa chance to talk about, anone in which I think you coulbring a huge private sector focus to that woulbe very, very helpful is this issue that the chairman brought up in his opening statement about a weather-ready Nation.	D
To think that literally NOAA was getting Weather Service information from Europe because they were further ahead--I think it was 4 days aheaof predicting what Sandy was going to be, than NOAA was capable of.	N
That is because they have institutenew technology anusean ensemble model, which basically analyzes the storm aninformation data in a new way, anthen presents it.	N
What do you think you can do to help bring us to a better weather-ready Nation aninstitute new technology?	N
I know that we just passea Sandy bill, anthere will be more supercomputing time, but this is an issue where we have to keep competitive.	N
I mean, the difference between knowing 15 minutes aheaof time anan hour aheaof time is a huge difference.	N
Part of the issue is that they have great satellite technology information, but it is often secure.	N
So what I guess I am looking for is your leadership ability coming in anbringing agencies together as well, anfiguring out how to get the best information into public officials' hands so that we can do a better job of helping people prepare, because the technology is there to know the power of these storms.	D
Anthe late Ron Brown once saithat he was Secretary of Commerce, but if a member of Congress was calling him, he guaranteeit was about fish.	N
AnI have the same concern anwant to know what your thoughts are on the Bristol Bay pebble mine, which is a mine that is in Alaska that has--basically it is at the heaof one of the largest sockeye fisheries anthe largest Chinook fisheries, which is basically the heawaters for Puget Sounsalmon.	N
So we want to make sure that you are going to be very adamant about gooscience leading the way to protecting against undue development that might impact those fisheries.	N
Well, I guess what I am interestein is whether you will have gooscience help engagein the process.	N
Again, appreciate your willingness to be subjecteto all these process to be a public servant, so I know that takes some time.	D
Let me--we talkeabout several issues, anI actually want to follow up on fish because, as you know, Alaska produces the wilcoAmerican fish product, about 60 percent, 50-something percent of the fish.	N
As the Chair of the Committee that deals with it here, you know, we are going to be going through the Magnuson-Stevens rewrite, so it is obviously something we will be engagewith you on.	N
But let me ask you, you know, we are going to lose, or you are going to lose, some of your appointed--the National Marine Fisheries Services, Eric Schwab, who is now stepping down.	N
Anthere has been a lot of issues to make sure we have good, strong leadership there, obviously also in NOAA.	N
I guess I want a commitment that you will make this a priority as quickly as possible because of the work that we have to do on the Magnuson-Stevens reauthorization bill anthe fisheries issues that are in front of us right now.	N
Let me also--we talkea little about satellites, one that you are learning quite a bit about.	N
Anthere is a group of independent review from the aerospace executives that call the program somewhat dysfunctional.	N
It makes a difference on our weather forecasts anwhen we do them so we do not have to depenon other people.	N
Will you commit to make sure that you will spenthe appropriate time to dive into how to make the system better than it is today?	N
Lots of it is arounallocations or getting the resources for them, anhelping us understanwhat we shoulbe doing to help make that better.	N
Actually in the President's Fiscal Year 2014 budget, he eliminates another 103 positions in the forecast offices, about now an 80 percent reduction.	N
You know running a business that when you start doing overtime, there are a lot of costs--fatigue another costs--	N
Can I get a commitment from you that you will reexamine the decision of the hiring freeze anhow they are handling furloughs in the Weather Service?	N
It is going to have a negative impact on the outcome, the product that we neefor situations like in Oklahoma or Sandy anotherwise.	N
This is one, anwe talkeabout this, on the Arctic oil angas issues anthe EIS, the environmental impact statement, that NOAA has their supplemental draft out right now.	N
The definition, when you look at it, it defines it almost as if the drilling program is to limit each company to only one drill well at a time in the theater, meaning two areas of theater, one rig, one well total.	N
Basically by that action, you couleconomically determine the outcome, which is nothing will happen.	N
But will give some assurances, at least here, that you will work to ensure that the people who have leases up there can fully utilize those leases under the conditions we set obviously anthe environmental conditions aneverything else, but not be--anthis is my phrase.	N
It is not, I think, what NOAA was doing, but back dooring it by collapsing their ability to move forwarby saying, well, sorry, you can only do one, that is it.	N
Well, we neethem to look at that whole air sheat one time, not just single applications that are coming in.	N
Woulyou commit to look at the broader picture anmaking sure that we do not something that negatively impacts their ability to move forwaron oil angas exploration of the Arctic?	N
I will leave it at that, anI want to just say that when you start to talk about Pebble Mine, a mine in Alaska, we woulencourage you to talk to us also.	N
I am aware that for a lot of gooreasons, a lot of Americans have a very cynical view of the Federal workforce anus.	N
They look at people who work for the Federal Government at large anmake assumptions that many times are unfair that there are Federal employees that are bureaucratic bozos, annot working very hard, anmaking way too much money, ansoaking off the taxpayers.	N
AnI have got to tell you, I finit very refreshing to finsomeone who is stepping up like you are in this position.	N
I think you are really coming because you have a desire to serve this country, anyour business backgrounis one that I think can serve this country very well.	D
The President has proposeto do away with the Commerce Department ancombine the Commerce Department, the Small Business Administration, USTR, another agencies that have various intersections with business in this country.	N
AnI woulask you, do you have some ideas on how your service in this job coulhelp move that goal forwarin terms of identifying some strong bipartisan arguments that can made?	N
Anone of the problems is we have lots of committees that deal with these various agencies that are not exciteabout the idea of us trying to avoisome of the duplication anoverlap.	N
I am wondering if you have given that any thought anif you see, baseon your business background, when sometimes streamlining, anselling, anmerging are essential, because you have the discipline of a bottom line.	D
Well, I woullook forwarto working with you on an ongoing basis, particularly when you finissues of duplication anoverlap.	N
I mean, you know, some people on my side of the aisle do not want to confront it, but there is duplication.	N
We have it in agriculture, we have it in Commerce, two programs with ostensibly the same goals, but two different sets of personnel, anrules, anprocedures dealing with the pots of money in both places.	N
So I woullove to work with you as you identify with an eye towards a business mindset how we coulwhack away a little bit.	N
The other thing I just want to mention to you is that I have discoverethere was an idea a while ago about creating a Federal workforce calleSenior Executive Service.	N
AnSenior Executive Service was createostensibly to develop great talent in the Federal Government to compete with the private sector.	N
Anthe idea is these woulbe highly qualifieemployees with a broabackgrounanknowledge, anthat they woulmove arounthe government basically with a lot of excellence, helping us do a better job performing the services that we must as the government.	N
I think that most of the Senior Executive Service in the Federal Government is not moving much.	N
Anit has come to my attention that they have continueto get very, very large bonuses, even in this economic climate.	N
I have put in a piece of legislation to stop the bonuses to Senior Executive Services employees.	N
I think the average bonus was aroun$16,000, anthe salaries for these people range between $119,000 an$180,000 a year.	N
So these are la creeme de la creeme of--even though they only make up, I think, 1 percent of the work force, I think they were getting certainly more than that in terms of bonuses they were receiving.	N
Anwhat I really fountroubling about it is that in some agencies, everyone in SES got the bonus.	N
I woulask you to take a look at SES in the Commerce Department, anparticularly the legislation I have introducewoulprohibit those bonuses from being given in the environment of sequestration, because most--we have got line employees that are having to take days off without pay, anthen we have this little upper crust of Federal employees that are still getting five figure bonuses.	N
So I woullove you to take a look at the SESs in the Commerce Department anlook at the bonus proposals anprocedures, anget back to my office as to what you think--I think GSA has reformeit on their own.	N
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, anthank you, Ms. Pritzker, for joining us today, for answering these questions.	N
Let me say at the outset that in a bipartisan note, I want to echo the comments that Senator McCaskill just raiseabout looking at the SES bonuses.	N
I woullike to begin by talking about a topic you anI talkeabout in my office, which was free trade.	N
Anin the course of that conversation, as I understoowhat you said, you saiyou were an enthusiastic, unapologetic advocate of free trade.	N
As I sharewith you, I have been disappointethat in my judgment the current Administration has been less than vigorous in pursuing free trade.	N
Anif you are confirmed, I hope that you will be an effective voice for making the Administration far more vigorous going forward.	N
A seconarea that we talkeabout that I woullike to discuss is the area of regulation.	N
I think that is the most critical element to ensuring our long-term strength analso expanding the opportunity in this country for the least well off among us to climb the economic ladder anto achieve the American Dream.	N
Anwe talkequite a bit about the impact of overly burdensome regulation anhow that can harm businesses, anespecially small businesses that are just starting anstruggling anthat, as you know, generate two-thirds of all new jobs.	N
Yesterday in confirmation hearings with the nominee in this room, the nominee to be Secretary of Transportation, I haa similar conversation with him anaskehim at the time if he woulcommit in his first 100 days to working to identifying at least three regulations that are overly burdensome, anto working with me anwith this committee to either modify or repeal those.	N
Anindeehis response, which I will confess, I likevery much, is that he suggestethat three might not be enough.	N
You also suggestein our conversation the concept of zero-baseregulation, that rather than piling one regulation on another, on another, anhaving them continue to grow vast anunwieldy, that we ought to start from a zero base anask what regulation is needeansensible.	N
I very much agree with that notion, anso I woulwelcome if you woulperhaps elaborate on the concept as you sharewhen we visited.	N
I look forwarto working with you on that, anI hope that if you are confirmethat you can provide a voice in this Administration for pulling back the regulations that I think are so damaging to economic growth anin killing jobs, anreally impacting in a negative way a great many Americans who are struggling.	N
Anas you know, right now, the vast majority of usable spectrum is either owneor shareby the government, 60 to 70 percent.	N
Anlast year's Spectrum Act statutorily requires the NTIA to ``promote the best possible anmost efficient use of electromagnetic spectrum resources across the Federal Government.''	N
In my view, Federal Government ownership of assets, be they spectrum, be they land, or anything else, shoulbe the minimum necessary to protect our critical national interests.	N
Anon spectrum, in particular, I woullike to see as much of it as possible placein the private sector hands to allow entrepreneurs anbusinesses to put it to productive use to generate economic growth angenerate jobs.	N
Anwoulyou agree to work together to try to assess just how much spectrum the Federal Government needs annow much of that can be solat significant profit to the government, to the private sector to be put to productive use for private Americans?	N
We are about ready to wrap this up, anthe unpleasantness is about over for Ms. Pritzker.	N
But I wanteto ask one other question, anfor a minute here I am going to channel Senator Grassley.	N
But some have criticizethe fact that you are a beneficiary of some offshore tax avoidance schemes, anthat it is hypocritical for the President to nominate Cabinet members who benefitefrom offshore tax havens when he has criticizethat practice for others.	D
One of the areas under your purview is going to be the Administration's enforcement of anti-dumping laws.	D
Anthe law is intendeto prevent domestic industries from being destroyeby imports that are solhere at unfairly low or dumpeprices.	N
The Commerce Department determines the precise amount of duties that must be collecteto increase the price of dumpeimports to a non-injurious level, anestimate$400 to $500 million in anti-dumping duties builon four different types of agricultural imports from China have remaineuncollected, aneven though their payment is secureby specializesingle-	N
entry customs bonds, which are referreto new shipper bonds, that were issueby well-known U.S. insurance companies.	N
The question is, will you commit to provide Congress with a full accounting of all the new shipper bonds that secure anti-	N
dumping duties on these agricultural imports from China ana plan for collecting the unpaidumping duties secureby these bonds?	N
There are a number of honey producers in South Dakota who woulbe very happy to hear that answer.	N
There is a lot of transshippehoney from China, anthe enforcement mechanisms that are available to prevent that do not get effectively utilized.	N
